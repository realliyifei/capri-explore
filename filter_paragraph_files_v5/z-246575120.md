Number of References: 27

(p6.0) IRS and backscatter communications can be considered key solutions for enhancing the spectrum and energy efficiencies of future wireless communications systems [38], [39]. The main principle of both technologies is based on reflecting the incident signals towards an intended destination. While IRS aims at improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination, backscatter communications aim at reflecting radio frequency (RF) signals to a passive or low-power backscatter communications device. IRS consists of passive metasurface elements that control the reflection angle of the incident signals, whereas backscatter communications devices consist of an antenna and an energy harvesting (EH) circuit with or without a dedicated power source to support the communications and sensory systems. Combining NOMA with IRS or backscatter communications can improve the coverage and energy efficiency of the system by facilitating the delivery of several coherent copies of the signal to the receiver. Furthermore, an IRS-assisted NOMA system with multiple transmit antennas enable channel manipulation to achieve the capacity region [40]. Therefore, NOMA combined with IRS or backscatter communications are considered energy, spectrum and cost-efficient solution for future wireless networks.

(p7.0) The evolution of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors have made it possible to use light sources for communications [41], [42]. Unlike optical fiber communications, VLC and free space optical (FSO) communications are performed wirelessly, where the former is mostly used for indoor mobile user applications, while the latter is used for outdoor applications such as backhauling for fixed pointto-point communications [43]. The frequency band for the VLC is 430 THz to 790 THz which corresponds to the unlicensed visible light spectrum, while the band for FSO includes infrared and ultraviolet. Such a wide free spectrum can provide a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity problem. Nonetheless, the main limitation of VLC and FSO systems is that the achievable data rates are constrained by the modulation bandwidth of the LEDs which spans a few hundred megahertz, hence can only utilize a small fraction of the available bandwidth at such frequencies [44]. It is worth noting that NOMA is particularly suitable for DL-VLC systems that aim at connecting a few users in a small cell, which is aligned with the principle of NOMA and small cell densification.

(p8.0) Utilizing some devices to relay the signals of other ones is an effective solution to extend the network range and overcome channel impairments such as fading, pathloss and shadowing. There are two main categories of such a solution, which are user relaying and dedicated relaying [45]. In the former, idle users act as relays, while in the latter category, dedicated relay nodes are distributed in the network. In general, two time slots are needed to relay the signal to the destination when half-duplex (HD) mode is considered, whereas one time slot is needed by the full-duplex (FD) mode. It is worth noting that high complexity and self-interference are the two main limitations for the FD mode. A simple network structure for dedicated user relaying in NOMA is that the near-user acts as a HD relay for the far-user either through decode-and-forward (DF) or amplify-and-forward (AF). In AF, a scaled version of the received signal is sent to the destination, while an attempt to detect the signal is made, then retransmission of the detected information takes place for DF. Various such network structures are discussed in [45].

(p14.0) When considering the analysis for given channel realizations, the DL analysis can be extended to UL directly. However, to get the average performance, then N-fold integration should be considered because N channel realizations affect the received signal at the BS. This makes the analysis challenging, therefore, different approaches are introduced to solve this issue. For example, the authors of [55] used the union bound for the outer integration and exponential bound for the inner integration. The total probability theorem and Taylor series expansion are then applied to get the average BER. Kara and Kaya in [46] utilized the fact that the channel realizations are independent and got the PDF of the joint channels. Hence, they were able to get the exact average BER in a single-integral form, in addition to deriving an approximate closed-form.

## (s15) F. POWER ASSIGNMENT
Number of References: 54

(p15.0) The PA scheme affects the error rate performance, and hence, it is a crucial aspect to discuss. Generally speaking, there are two main PA schemes, which are fixed PA and adaptive PA. The former ensures minimum signaling overhead and low complexity owing to its non-optimality, whereas the latter can ensure optimality or sub-optimality but with higher signaling overhead and complexity [34]. A number of issues should be considered when designing both schemes. First, ambiguity at the receivers. For example, ambiguity can be caused at the receivers for two NOMA users with binary phase shift keying (BPSK) if equal power coefficients are given when x 1 = −x 2 . Hence, two NOMA symbols will coincide on the same constellation point.

(p15.1) Moreover, enabling reliable detection using SIC requires abiding by certain power coefficient bounds (PCBs) [34], [47], [56], [57], [58]. Considering the previous example, when α 1 < α 2 the order of the NOMA symbols is as follows from the negative in-phase axis: 11, 01, 10, 00. In such a scenario, MLD can detect b 2 reliably because b 2 = 0 is always in the positive side. Hence, SIC can cancel the interference caused by b 2 and detect b 1 reliably. In contrast, when α 1 > α 2 , the two middle symbols swap order causing b 2 = 0 to fall in two different regions. Therefore, MLD will not be able to detect b 2 correctly, and hence the SIC performance will be unreliable. It is worth noting that this problem is not encountered when JMLD is used.

## (s16) G. USER PAIRING
Number of References: 9

(p16.0) User pairing is the scheduler's process of selecting a set of users to share the same communication resource. In a DL/UL coordinated scenario, the BS acts as a centralized unit to coordinate the user pairing process to achieve a certain objective. For example, the objective could be the sum rate maximization while satisfying certain quality of service (QoS) constraints such as minimum rate per user or maximum BER per user. Also, user pairing can aim to ensure fairness among users. Furthermore, the satisfaction of such objectives and constraints depends on the network knowledge available at the scheduler. For instance, user pairing can satisfy certain criteria instantaneously if the CSI knowledge of all links is available instantaneously. Alternatively, such criteria can be satisfied on average if statistical CSI knowledge is available. For instance, it is reported that pairing users with the most distinct channel gains would maximize the sum rate in NOMA systems. The concept of prioritizing users with different priorities is known as cognitive radio (CR)-NOMA in which the primary user is given the highest priority while the secondary user is served opportunistically. Moreover, CR-NOMA tends to pair the best channel user with the second best channel user [59]. On the other hand, the UL decentralized scenario usually refers to the grant free access (GFA) in which the users are allowed random access to the channel without resource allocation. Hence, collisions might occur where the BS needs to detect collisions and resolve them in order to detect the messages.

(p22.0) Synchronous UL-NOMA is studied while considering the two-user scenario [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90] and arbitrary number of users [36], [91]. In [84], [85], [86], closed-form BER expressions are derived for SISO setup over AWGN channels, where imperfect SIC is assumed. For example, both users use QPSK in [84], [85], whereas QPSK and BPSK are assigned to the near and far-users to account for channel asymmetry in [86]. Furthermore, accurate BER expressions over fading channels are derived for JMLD in [87], [88], where [87] considers SISO Rician channel and BPSK, while [88] considers single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) Rayleigh fading channel and QPSK.

(p22.1) Liu and Beaulieu [89] derive closed-form union bounds on the SER and BER of the two-user NOMA with QPSK for arbitrary relative phase offset in AWGN channel. These expressions are valid for both UL and DL, where intentional phase rotation can be applied for the former, and the channel can add phase rotation in the UL. Additionally, exact single-integral-from of the SER and BER expressions are derived for a specific power ratio. The authors of [90] study a multicarrier under-lay CR-NOMA system in the UL. By employing perfect SIC at the receiver, analytical expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels for the SER per sub-carrier of both the primary and secondary users with QPSK.

A comprehensive performance analysis of an UL-NOMA with adaptive M n -QAM in the presence of Rayleigh fading channels is proposed in [91]. The system consists of N users, each equipped with a single antenna, transmitting data to a BS with multiple receiving antennas. The BS employs maximal ratio combining (MRC) to combine the received signals from all antennas and JMLD for jointly estimating the symbols of each user. The system's performance is evaluated in terms of PEP. The utilization of MRC-JMLD effectively eliminates the error floor.

## (s24) 1) MAXIMUM THROUGHPUT DESIGN
Number of References: 126

(p24.0) For example, references [92], [93], [94], [95], [96] study resource allocation of two-user DL-NOMA system to maximize the sum-rate using practical modulation schemes such as M n -QAM while satisfying the BER/BLER constraints. Unlike single carrier systems [96], maximizing the sum-rate in multicarrier systems is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problem that requires highly complex exhaustive search [92], [93]. Therefore, it is important to design efficient algorithms. Cejudo et al. [92] design an efficient resource allocation algorithm to maximize the sum-rate while satisfying the BER constraints. Accurate instantaneous BER expressions are presented for square M n -QAM considering imperfect SIC. These expressions are used to derive the exact optimal channel gain ratios between a pair of NOMA users, maximizing the achievable sum-rate for a given BER constrain. To ensure reliable SIC detection, the power coefficient for equally-spaced constellation points or highly separable constellation points groups is presented in closed-form. The exact optimal channel gain ratios and the approximated BER expressions over Rayleigh flat fading channel are used to design an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm which involves user pairing algorithm and continuous power and rate allocation. It is worthy to mention that when NOMA is infeasible, the subcarrier is not used. Moreover, control channel is used to inform the users about the rate, power and subcarrier assignment.

(p24.1) Assaf et al. [93] design an efficient iterative greedy algorithm to maximize the system throughput while satisfying the users' BER constraints. Adaptive modulation, fixed power allocation and hybrid OMA/NOMA are utilized by the design. It is noteworthy to mention that relying on exact rather than approximate NOMA BER expressions induce high computational complexity.

(p24.2) The authors of [94] design an adaptive modulation and PA scheme for packet-based NOMA to maximize the throughput. The design considers optimizing the transmission mode (TM) by the BS which tunes the modulation orders and power coefficients while satisfying the BLER requirement for each user. Two PA schemes are considered: 1) Fixed PA based on linear mapping. 2) Adaptive PA. The former optimization is solved using integer programming while the latter is solved using mixed-integer programming. In addition, the computational complexity is reduced using an efficient terminating criterion, segment-line search, and quantized SNRs. Approximated closed-form BLER expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels. The authors extend their work in [95] by proposing the min-max method to solve the fixed PA optimization. Such a method reduces the complexity and the number of TMs significantly while improving the throughput of the system. The authors of [96] propose a joint adaptive power and modulation order to maximize the SER without sacrificing the BER performance, where the BER expressions of NOMA over Rayleigh fading are approximated as OMA counterpart. This is applicable only when assuming perfect SIC. Two adaptive power schemes are proposed to guarantee the minimum target rate for one user while maximizing the rate of the other user. Continuous and discrete adaptive rate modulation are considered to adapt to the channel fade level.

(p24.3) Adaptive modulation is studied for UL-NOMA in [97], where an asymmetric adaptive modulation algorithm is designed for a two-user UL-NOMA system to maximize the system throughput for a given average SNRs and BER thresholds. The BER expressions are derived in closed-form for AWGN channels considering imperfect SIC and M n -PSK with M n ∈ {2, 4}. Lower bound BER expressions are derived for Rayleigh fading channels while ignoring the channel phase effect.

(p25.0) References [49], [50], [98], [99] formulate several optimization problems to minimize the error performance of DL-NOMA systems. For example, the objective function in [49] is to minimize the instantaneous SER of the strong user while satisfying the SER requirement for the weak user. The instantaneous SER is derived in closed-form for both users considering M n -QAM and M n -PAM. Nonetheless, a closed-form suboptimal PA is derived. The authors of [50] propose a line search algorithm for a two-user system to find the optimal power coefficients that minimize the un/coded NOMA system overall error performance in AWGN channels. BER is considered and derived for the uncoded QPSK, while the SPC BER approximation is considered for the coded system. The work is extended in [98] to consider square M n -QAM, where the BER is approximated using the SER expressions derived for AWGN channels. These expressions are used to find the optimal power coefficients that minimize the instantaneous overall system BER. The optimization problem is simplified by obtaining upper and lower bounds of the overall BER.

(p25.1) Dutta [99] approximates the closed-form BER expressions using the SER expressions that are derived for an arbitrary number of DL-NOMA users, considering arbitrary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and perfect SIC. These expressions have been used for power allocation optimization such that the average BER among all users is minimized while satisfying certain minimum rate requirements per user. Since the problem is non-convex, an upper bound approximation is used for the objective function to make it convex, while the concave rate is transformed to be convex. As the probability of error considers all the possible realizations of the input vector, it is computationally difficult to handle the objective function. Hence, a faster approach is developed to find the optimal power coefficients, which is based on splitting the data sets into subsets and running the optimization for all subsets in parallel.

(p25.2) Optimizing the error rate performance of the UL-NOMA system is studied in [100] which derives closed-form optimal power coefficients and phases to maximize the minimum ED of the sum of the constellations of two-user NOMA with square M n -QAM, while JMLD is used at the receiver. The resulting sum constellation is found to be a uniform M-QAM constellation of a larger size. Mixed-integer optimization is used to formulate the problem, where the complex Rayleigh fading channel is decomposed into symmetrical real and imaginary parts. Only one part is analyzed due to symmetry.

(p27.0) The error rate performance of NOMA is highly impacted by the symbol-to-bit labeling strategy used, [102], [103], [104], [105], [106]. There are three main labeling strategies which are: 1) NOMA non-Gray labeling, 2) Joint Gray labeling, 3) Natural labeling. The NOMA non-Gray labeling results naturally from the SC process. An example is shown in Fig. 5a. On the other hand, the joint Gray labeling is simply performed such that the NOMA word becomes Gray coded. This is done before SC on each user stream of bits, b n , such that the stream of bits after joint Gray coding is
## (s29) State-of-the-Art on NOMA with Constellation Rotation:
Number of References: 45

(p29.0) The work in [107] studies constellation rotation for the DL scenario with two users each of which is using QPSK. Because deriving exact closed-form SER expressions is challenging due to the arrangement of the NOMA constellation points, upper bounds on the SER are presented based on the union bound of the PEPs. These expressions are used for rotation angles optimization which is performed using exhaustive search. Chang and Fukawa [108] derive the optimal rotation angles that minimize ED between the NOMA constellation points for the two-user case while considering identical QPSK and QPSK with 16-QAM. Furthermore, the work is extended to the three-user case using QPSK in [109], where the optimal phase rotation is found for two schemes which are: 1) rotation for the near-user. 2) rotation for the near-user and the composite of near and middle users. Reference [110] studies two users NOMA with QPSK and finds the rotation angle that minimizes the dominant PEP, which translates to maximizing the smallest ED. It is found that the optimal rotation angle depends on the ratio of the assigned power coefficients and phase differences between the channel coefficients for UL, while it only depends on the ratio of the assigned power coefficients for DL. The work is extended in [111] by jointly optimizing the power coefficients and rotation angles. In [112], the authors propose phase pre-distortion for UL VLC-NOMA system to improve the SER. Assuming that the phase difference between the channels of the two users is uniformly distributed, closed-form SER expressions are derived considering QPSK for both users and SIC at the receiver. The optimal rotation angle that minimizes the SER is found to be the one that ensures 0 • relative phase, i.e., angle that causes co-phasing. Closed-form optimal rotation angles were derived for single and multi-receiving antenna cases. The joint optimization problem reduces to a piece-wise convex optimization problem over its sub-domains, for which the global maximum solution is obtained in closed-form. The work in [113] proposes an algebraic rotation approach to design DL-NOMA for two users while achieving full diversity and improved BER performance. This improvement gained due to the special lattice partition scheme that ensures maximum minimum product distance. The upper bound of the minimum product distance is derived in closed-form for arbitrary power coefficients for the two dimensional lattice. The work is generalized in [114] for multi-dimensional lattices. It is worthy to mention that the design and analysis are applicable to the JMLD rather than SIC, which imposes high complexity at the receiver, but reduces the decoding delay. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional NOMA and the scheme proposed in [107] in fast and block fading channels.

(p29.1) Ye et al. [115] study a two-user multi-antenna UL-NOMA with SIC utilizing constellation rotation. Optimal rotation angles are found to maximize the mutual information (MI) where the signal is modeled as a Gaussian mixture model. The MI maximization problem has high computational complexity because it is a bivariate problem. Hence, it is transformed to an entropy maximization problem that involves only a single random variable. Efficient closed-form approximation is derived using variational approximation. Improved sum-rate and lower BER are obtained when compared to conventional NOMA. Constellation rotation with space-time line code (STLC) is considered in [55] for two-user UL-NOMA, where the BS is equipped with two receiving antennas and each user is equipped with a single antenna. The channel between each user and each receiving antenna at the BS is assumed to be quasi-static for two time slots and known to the user. Hence, spatial diversity can be obtained using STLC-encoding. Assuming that QPSK is used by both users and constellation rotation is applied to one user only, upper bound expressions for the average BER are derived for the JMLD using the union bound of the PEPs. Additionally, an approximation is derived for high SNRs using Taylor series.

(p29.2) The authors of [116] propose a novel scheme for the single antenna DL-NOMA based on coordinate interleaving for a general number of users, where M n -pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) constellation is rotated by π/4 rad counter clock-wise. Because the real and imaginary components of the π/4 M n -PAM constellation are equal, then coordinate interleaving for the two-user case results in

(p29.3) It is worth noting that x sc in its current form does not have a unity average power. In fact E[|x sc | 2 ] = 2. Therefore, it has to be normalized for a fair comparison with the conventional NOMA system. Additionally, this scheme eliminates the need for using SIC at the receiver for the two-user case, while it reduces the number of SIC operations by more than half when there is more than two users in the system. Furthermore, closed-form SER expressions are derived for the two-user, as well as the optimal power coefficients that achieve fairness. A DL-NOMA scheme for a cluster of four users is proposed in [117] by utilizing phase rotation to achieve a lower BER and higher sum rate. The optimal rotation angle is determined to maximize the minimum distance between symbols, thereby improving overall system performance. Furthermore, the optimal power allocation is determined by minimizing both the inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances in the NOMA signal. The proposed method reduces the overall complexity by eliminating the need for SIC between subgroup multiplexing. Exact BER and union bound on BER expressions are derived for all users using M n -PSK or M n -QAM in a Rayleigh fading channel.

(p29.4) In [118], a constellation rotation technique is proposed for an UL-NOMA based IoT network to enhance performance. It is assumed that perfect CSI is available to the transmitting nodes, where each transmitter is equipped with a single antenna and the access point employs two antennas. The upper bounds on the BER over Rayleigh fading channels are derived for the case with two transmitters and QPSK. Both dynamic and fixed constellation rotation scenarios are considered, and optimal rotation angles are determined for a given SNR to improve the BER.

(p29.5) Reddy et al. [119] propose optimal constellation rotation for the two-user DL-NOMA system considering M n -PSK signaling over correlated SIMO Rician channels. By modifying the NOMA SC as follows,

(p30.0) Multiuser interference generally causes performance degradation for NOMA users. However, constructive interference may improve the performance as the desired signal power is boosted by the interference. On the other hand, destructive interference degrades the performance of NOMA. Therefore, the concept of interference alignment is to design the individual users' signals such that they add constructively. This can be achieved via phase rotation [127], [128], [129] or symbol scaling [130], [131]. A summary of the work on interference alignment is given in Table 9.

(p31.0) The work in [127] proposes a constellation rotation scheme for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-assisted NOMA to maximize the energy transmitted to the wireless information transfer (WIT) users and wireless power transfer (WPT) users, while satisfying acceptable SER performance for the WIT users. To minimize the signaling overhead associated with informing the WIT receivers about the optimal rotation angles, the constellation rotation is performed jointly over a block of symbols rather  than on a symbol-by-symbol basis. The optimal constellation rotation angles are derived for QPSK case assuming two NOMA WIT users and a single WPT user. The work is extended in [128] by considering a multi-carrier system, arbitrary modulation orders, and multi WIT and WPT users. A joint design of the energy interleaver and constellation rotation is proposed, where the energy interleaver is introduced to suppress the destructive interference of multiple symbols scheduled on each subcarrier. Furthermore, the receiver operations for WIT and WPT users as well as the signaling overhead are discussed thoroughly. An iterative algorithm is proposed for obtaining optimal the constellation rotation angles since the objective function is non-convex. Whereas a low-complexity greedy algorithm is proposed for the energy interleaver integer optimization. In [129], phase rotation is applied to the near-user to allow constructive interference with the far-user symbol. In addition, a nonredundunt precoding is applied to the near-user symbol to allow symbol extraction at the receiver. The authors propose a semi-blind detection scheme based on independent component analysis to detect the near-user symbols after rotation. Nonetheless, it requires 1-2 pilot symbols to remove ambiguities caused by the independent component analysis. The SER is derived in closed-form under Rayleigh fading for two users with QPSK assuming perfect ambiguity elimination. Additionally, an efficient power allocation algorithm that is based on statistical channel information is proposed to minimize the average asymptotic SER. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the scheme is studied and compared with other common benchmarks, such as [108], [111].

## (s33) D. CHANNEL CODING
Number of References: 27

(p33.0) Channel coding is a well-known approach to reduce the error probability of digital communications systems at the cost of higher complexity at the transmitter and the receiver. Thus, studying the complexity and error rate performance of NOMA-based channel coding transceivers is pivotal. Typical channel coding schemes include low-density parity-check (LDPC) [132], [133], Reed-Solomon codes [132], trellis coded modulation (TCM) [134], polar codes [135], turbo codes [136], and repetition codes [137]. A comprehensive summary for the NOMA work with channel coding is depicted in Table 10.

(p33.1) State-of-the-Art on NOMA with Channel Coding: The authors of [132] propose a novel linear receiver that exploits the constraints of the forward error correcting (FEC) codes to mitigate the SIC error propagation caused by the imperfect CSI at the receiver, where the channel frequency response is estimated by interpolating the responses of the pilot subcarriers. The novel receiver is applicable to symbol and codeword-level SIC. It is designed for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-user UL-NOMA based on the minimum output energy criterion that can handle moderate channel estimation errors, where the IUIs are separated from the desired signals by adopting a unique signature based on the FEC codes' constraints. The receiver optimization is formulated as a quadratic programming problem anchored with set of code constraints. Transmit diversity and capacityachieving LDPC codes are considered. To improve the performance further, an iterative receiver is designed to recover the Reed-Solomon coded data that is serially concatenated to an LDPC code. To verify the reliability of the proposed detector, an upper bound for the coded BER is derived based on the union bound of the PEPs. The authors of [133] propose probabilistic shaping combined with QAM for N UL-NOMA users in Rayleigh fading channels to improve the SER. Probabilistic shaping assigns the constellation points that have equidistance space different probabilities such that the source generates information symbols with non-uniform probabilities using a constant composition distribution matcher method. To maximize the ergodic constrained capacity, a multi-step optimization is performed to find the optimal probability mass function for each user, where the optimization order is the inverse of the SIC order. At the receiver, maximum a posterior (MAP)based codeword-level SIC is implemented with an order determined by the large-scale pathloss. Unlike the symbollevel SIC, the codeword-level SIC can ideally cancel the IUI caused by the previously decoded signals due to the powerful error correcting codes as well as the soft channel decoder. Whereas the rest IUIs are assumed to be Gaussian distributed.

(p34.0) In [138], wavelet transform pulse shaping is analyzed for the DL OFDM NOMA as it is more spectrally efficient than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pulse shaping which requires cyclic prefix. Closed-form BER expressions are derived for both pulse shaping schemes in AWGN channels based on the ED approach, where the presented analysis holds for two-user case with QPSK assuming ideal synchronization. The strong channel user applies SIC to detect its signal, whereas the weak channel user detects its signal assuming that the other user signal being in the noise floor. The effect of the AWGN on the received signal is studied after passing the AWGN components through the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) filter banks and getting their true variances. Since the high frequency components are discarded in the DWT filter banks, the channel effect on the received signal is reduced and the signal recovery is improved.

(p34.1) Maatouk et al. [139] propose combining orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA) for DL-NOMA. Unlike conventional NOMA which for example combines two users and uses SIC to cancel the interference, the proposed scheme combines two groups of users with two sets of orthogonal waveforms and uses iterative SIC to cancel the interference between the groups. The users in the OFDMA group can detect their signal directly as the number of the users in the CDMA group is assumed to be small such that the interference is negligible. On the other hand, the users of the CDMA group need to use iterative SIC to cancel the interference. Khansa et al. [140] extend the work by introducing a power split between the two groups that follows the conventional NOMA. Approximate BER expressions are derived for QPSK case in AWGN channel by assuming the interference being a Gaussian-like signal for the OFDMA group of users, while the number of possible sequence errors for the CDMA group is assumed to follow the binomial distribution.

(p36.0) Haci et al. [142] study the asynchronous UL-NOMA system as perfect synchronization is difficult to achieve for UL users distributed in geographically diverse and dynamic environments. They propose a novel triangular-SIC detector which uses multiple symbols from each interfering user in a triangular pattern to carry out interference cancellation, where iterative soft and hard decision detectors are studied for higher modulation orders. The BER performance analysis is presented in [143] for the three-user case in flat Rayleigh fading considering conventional SIC and the proposed SIC, where besides the receiver power ratios, the BER of the proposed SIC depends also on the iteration number and the time offset between users. It is assumed that the relative time offset between the users is uniformly distributed, and the residual interference is approximated to the Gaussian distribution.

The detector is based on the triangular-SIC introduced by [142], [143] where an optimal time-offset is selected to eliminate the IUI. The optimal time offset is found to be half the symbol duration for the QPSK case. It is worth mentioning that the proposed detector does not introduce signaling overhead nor higher complexity, however, it requires the received symbol timing. Exact BER expressions are derived over AWGN channel considering two-user case with QPSK and imperfect SIC, where no relative phase rotation is assumed between the users. Additionally, a simpler BER approximation is derived for the weak user by relaxing the correlation between the noise samples at the detector. Furthermore, Liu et al.

(p41.16) The error rate performance of DL-NOMA for VLC applications is considered in [11], [12], [151], [152], [153], [154], [155], [156], [157], [158], [159], [160], [161], [162], [163]. Huang et al. [151] attempt to characterize the SER by analytically deriving the SER expressions considering multiple LEDs, unipolar transmission and line-of-sight (LoS) optical channels that are corrupted by AWGN. The PDF of the optical channel is obtained using the change of variable method, while the SER derivation is simplified using convolution theory and subsection integral method. Marshoud et al. [152] derive closed-form BER expressions taking into account perfect and imperfect SIC. The work considers a single LED with an arbitrary number of users using unipolar OOK. Marshoud et al. [11] extend the work in [152] to consider noisy CSI as well as outdated CSI, where an approximation is derived for the former, while an upper bound is derived for the latter. Additionally, BER expressions are derived for analog and digital dimming control.

(p41.17) The authors of [153] derive closed-form BER expressions for two-user system considering imperfect SIC and a fixed set of M n -PSK. The work is extended in [154] to consider modulation schemes such as QAM and PAM. Almohimmah and Alresheedi [155] derive exact closed-form SER for twouser scenario considering imperfect SIC and arbitrary square M n -QAM. Similarly, Jain et al. [12] derive closed-form BER expressions considering OOK in underwater environments, where the channel is modeled as an exponential generalized gamma distribution. The system is analyzed and validated for parameters such as air bubble levels, gradient temperature and salinity level of the water.

(p41.18) The authors of [156] categorize the users in a cell based on their data rate requirements. Hence, they propose an adjustable bit-rate SC such that each user bit interval is multiple base intervals, where the base interval is the bit interval of the lowest bit rate. Unlike the conventional SIC, the sample-and-sum SIC is introduced to minimize the error propagation caused by the conventional SIC, where each user samples the SC signal at a certain sample rate. Then, these samples will be summed for decoding. Moreover, a modified fixed power allocation is proposed to provide some clear correlation between the effects of adjusting power coefficients and the BER performance. The authors derive closed-form BER expressions for the multiuser scenario with OOK. Furthermore, the authors of [157] propose using OOK for the low data rate user, while MPPM is assigned for the high data rate user. To overcome the error propagation, a SICfree detector is proposed, where the MPPM user uses soft decision detector, whereas the OOK user sums the detected samples and uses MLD to detect its signal. A closed-form SER expression is derived for the OOK user, while a singleintegral form SER expression is derived for the MPPM user. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation for the probability of the number of erroneously detected slots in one MPPM symbol is derived.

(p41.19) For a two-user system, the authors of [158] propose adjusting the constellation of one user to improve the overall BER. Closed-form BER expressions are derived considering QPSK for both users, and the convexity of the objective function is proved as the Hessian matrix of the objective function is positive semi-definite. Furthermore, the Lagrangian is used to find the optimal constellation parameters, where the optimal parameters are presented for various SNRs.

(p41.20) Dixit and Kumar [159] analyze repetition code with multiple transmitting LEDs system, where MRC is used to combine the signals received by the multiple photodetectors. The BER is studied for the generalized multiuser case considering OOK and imperfect SIC. Additionally, closed-form expressions are derived for the three-user case.

(p41.21) Furthermore, Dixit and Kumar [160] consider a two-user case, where the near-and far-users are assigned OOK and M n -PPM, respectively. The closed-form BER expressions are derived considering imperfect SIC as well as imperfect CSI. Moreover, this system model is extended for 2 × 2 MIMO with repetition coding and MRC in [161]. The BER is analyzed for imperfect SIC. Also, dynamic field of view strategies are proposed to control the incident angle of the optical signal in order to improve the performance.

(p41.22) Reference [162] studies the non-linear behavior of the LED in MIMO channels. To address this performancelimiting factor, a pre-distorter is designed using singular value decomposition-based Chebyshev precoding, which is applicable for correlated-channels scenario and arbitrary number of users. Additionally, CR-NOMA power allocation policy is introduced to satisfy the user's QoS requirements. Upper bound BER expressions are derived for square M n -QAM considering Gaussian residual interference and imperfect CSI.

(p41.23) Reference [173] studies a hybrid RF-VLC NOMA system with physical layer network coding (PLNC). In the first phase, the two users transmit their RF signals to the BS using NOMA. In the second stage, the BS applies PLNC on the received signals and broadcasts an optical signal to both users. Assuming BPSK and considering imperfect SIC, an approximate BER expressions are derived for: 1) The first phase over Rayleigh fading. 2) The second phase over a VLC channel.

(p44.0) The authors of [172] study the performance of the UL bistatic backscatter communications-aided NOMA for IoT sensors. Two backscatter nodes are co-located near the carrier emitter assuming interference-free channels. The backscatter nodes operate in two modes, namely the EH mode and the active mode, in which performing intentional impedance mismatch at the antenna input, produces two reflection coefficients to modulate the carrier signal with BPSK. The Nakagami-m fading channel multiplexes the modulated BPSK symbols in the power domain using NOMA. The backscatter reader receives the NOMA symbol and performs SIC for detection. As the analysis of such a problem is challenging, closed-from BER expressions are derived by ignoring the phases of the channels between the backscatter nodes and the backscatter reader. Also, the channels are assumed to be ordered, however, order statistics are not used. Rather than considering double-integration with respect to the Nakagami-m fading coefficients, the sum and difference of the fading coefficients are approximated by another Nakagami-m random variables.

(p46.0) Kara and Kaya [174], [175], consider a diamond-shaped CRS based on NOMA, with two HD-DF relays and a single destination. It is assumed that one relay is located at a far distance from the source, while the other relay is located closer. The transmission is accomplished in two time slots. During the first time slot, the source transmits a NOMA symbol of two BPSK modulated signals to both relays. The far relay employs single-user MLD, whereas the near relay uses SIC. In the second time slot, both relays use the UL-NOMA concept to forward the detected information to the destination. Finally, the signal received from the near relay is detected by the destination, while the signal received from the far relay is detected using SIC. For both time slots, the authors derive the BER over a SISO Rayleigh fading channel. Moreover, Kara and Kaya [176] consider a two-user DL-CRS with a single HD-DF relay located closer to the near-user, where no direct link exists between the users and BS. In the first time slot, the PA is applied in a reversed order, i.e., the power allocated to the near-user is larger than the power allocated to the far-user. However, the PA in the second time slot follows the conventional approach. It is worth noting that the SIC decoding order depends on the PA. Exact closedform BER expression is derived for identical QPSK with imperfect CSI over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p46.1) Kara et al. [177] propose using NOMA for a single-user CRS to overcome the SER degradation inherent to HD mode. In the proposed model, the source multiplexes two consecutive symbols as a NOMA symbol, where the first symbol x 1 is treated as the near-user, and thus it is allocated less power than the second symbol x 2 , the NOMA symbol is then transmitted to a HD-DF relay and to the destination. During the first time slot, the destination detects only x 2 while treating x 1 to be in the noise floor. The relay detects x 1 using SIC and forwards it to the destination in the second time slot. Exact closed-form BER expression is derived for BPSK over Nakagami-m fading channels. Further, the authors propose a machine learning PA algorithm to minimize the BER.

(p46.2) The RHIs of a multiuser DL-NOMA CRS that consists of a single HD-AF relay is studied in [178]. The users are considered to be within close proximity of each other, and they do not have a direct link with the BS. Assuming imperfect SIC, PEP expressions are derived over ordered Rayleigh fading channels. In [179], a two-user DL-NOMA CRS with R HD-DF relays is investigated, with each user having a dedicated relay that is selected based on a max-min criterion. It is assumed that no direct link exists between the BS and users. The far-user, which is a high-priority user, applies MLD for detection, while the near-user, which is a delay-tolerant user, applies SIC for detection. The average BER expressions are derived for BPSK over Rayleigh fading channels. In [180], a two-user UL-NOMA CRS with a single HD-AF relay is studied, where both users are at the cell edge and no direct link exists with the BS. In the first time slot, both users transmit their signals to the relay using UL-NOMA. In the second time slot, the relay applies linear noise reduction to the NOMA signal, the signal is then amplified and transmitted to the BS, which uses SIC for detection. Approximate SER is derived analytically which is accurate at high SNRs.

[182] study a two-way relaying system that improves the spectral efficiency by allowing two users to exchange data bi-directionally through two intermediate HD-DF relays in a PLNC fashion. In particular, during the first time slot, each user sends its DL-NOMA intended to the two relays. Consequently, the signals received at the relays follow the UL-NOMA principle. Each relay performs JMLD to detect its signals from the two users and combine them following PLNC principle. During the second time slot, the relays send the PLNC signal to the users following the UL-NOMA principle. Finally, given that each user knows its transmitted signals, it can detect the other user's signal using JMLD. The authors derive closed-form BER expressions over Rayleigh fading channels. The authors of [183] study a DL-NOMA CRS for hybrid satellite-terrestrial communication. During the first time slot, the satellite transmits to a ground destination and a ground relay. During the second time slot, the ground DF relay simultaneously transmits to the ground destination and a cellular user using DL-NOMA. Assuming imperfect SIC and co-channel interference, the authors derive closed-form SER expressions over shadowed Rician fading channels.

(p47.0) Kara and Kaya [186] study the BER of a two-user DL cooperative NOMA system, where the near-user acts as an opportunistic HD-DF relay for the far-user, forwarding the detected symbols of the far-user if the SINR is greater than a predefined threshold. Assuming that the direct link between the BS and the far use exists, the far-user uses MRC to combine the two signals received from the BS and the relay. Closed-form BER expressions are derived for both users over SISO Rayleigh fading channels assuming M n -QAM. It is worth noting that the analysis for the near-user is performed considering imperfect SIC. Furthermore, the optimum threshold that minimizes the BER is derived. By relaxing the threshold condition for relaying, the work in [187] derives the BER expressions, where QPSK and BPSK are used by the near-and far-user, respectively. Jain et al. [188] study the performance of a DL-NOMA CRS that consists of two cell edge users, each of which is assisted by a HD-DF user. The near-far problem is considered such that the relays do not interfere with each other. The near-relay uses SIC for detection, while the far relay uses MLD. The system considers that there is no direct link between the BS and cell-edge users. The authors derive the average BER over Nakagami-m fading channels and present instantaneous PER expressions. The analysis of two-user DL-NOMA CRS is provided in [189], where the near-user acts as a FD-DF for the far-user, which has no link with the BS except through the relay. The relay receives a NOMA signal from the BS for both users and the self-interference signal caused by the FD mode. Both users detect their corresponding signals using SIC. The authors analyze the PEP of the system for both users over Rayleigh fading channels, assuming MLD at the far-user and imperfect SIC at the near-user. In addition, an asymptotic analysis is performed for both users at high SNRs. The analytical expressions are validated for the BPSK case. Sashiganth et al. [190] considered a system model similar to [189] except that UL is also included and the BER is presented in the form of approximation. Reference [191] explores the BER performance of FD cooperative NOMA systems over Rayleigh fading channel. The exact BER expressions are derived, accounting for imperfect SIC and residual self-interference (RSI). The system consists of a BS and a far-user, both with a single antenna, as well as a near-user utilizing multiple antennas to act as a relay in a DF-FD mode. Notably, different modulation schemes, including BPSK for the far-user and QPSK for the near-user. Also, M n -PAM and M n -QAM are considered for a comprehensive analysis.

[188] study the performance of a DL-NOMA CRS that consists of two cell edge users, each of which is assisted by a HD-DF user. The near-far problem is considered such that the relays do not interfere with each other. The near-relay uses SIC for detection, while the far relay uses MLD. The system considers that there is no direct link between the BS and cell-edge users. The authors derive the average BER over Nakagami-m fading channels and present instantaneous PER expressions. The analysis of two-user DL-NOMA CRS is provided in [189], where the near-user acts as a FD-DF for the far-user, which has no link with the BS except through the relay. The relay receives a NOMA signal from the BS for both users and the self-interference signal caused by the FD mode. Both users detect their corresponding signals using SIC. The authors analyze the PEP of the system for both users over Rayleigh fading channels, assuming MLD at the far-user and imperfect SIC at the near-user. In addition, an asymptotic analysis is performed for both users at high SNRs. The analytical expressions are validated for the BPSK case. Sashiganth et al. [190] considered a system model similar to [189] except that UL is also included and the BER is presented in the form of approximation. Reference [191] explores the BER performance of FD cooperative NOMA systems over Rayleigh fading channel.

(p48.0) Similar to the system model in [186], [187], the authors of [192] consider the near-user to be a SWIPT-enabled relay for the far-user, where the link between the BS and far-user does not exist. The proposed model is shown in Fig. 12. The union bound on the PEPs over ordered Rayleigh fading channels is derived for the near-and faruser while taking the AF and DF relaying protocols into account. It is worth noting that the analytical results are validated only for BPSK. Moreover, the authors of [193] extend the work to N users, while assuming AF relay. Closed-form PEP expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels. In [194], a cooperative NOMA system with SWIPT-enabled relay is investigated. The system model generally follows the one in [177] except that the relay harvests energy from the received NOMA signal during the first phase. Closed-form average BER is derived for BPSK modulation. In addition, machine learning is used to optimize the power sharing-power allocation to minimize the BER. Khennoufa et al. [195] study a cooperative DL-NOMA with EH, where the DF relay harvests the energy from the RF transmitted from the BS. Closed-form BER expressions over Nakagami-m fading channels are derived for a hybrid EH, i.e., power-time splitting, and EH techniques including time-splitting and power-splitting.

(p48.1) A SISO cooperative DL-NOMA for N SWIPT-enabled HD-AF relays and N users is proposed in [196]. The relays harvest energy from the received NOMA signal for a certain time, whereas the residual time is used to amplify and transmit the signal to the users. The exact and approximate PEP expressions are derived for all users. In [197], the cooperative NOMA is investigated, where a single SWIPT-enabled relay from the total of R relays is selected during the broadcast phase for cooperation between the transmitter and N users. The relay is selected based on the channel quality between the transmitter and the corresponding relay. Each relay is assumed to operate in HD mode using the AF protocol.

Number of References: 36

(p49.0) In [198], an underlay CR scenario in a SISO cooperative DL-NOMA is presented. As shown in Fig. 13, the system under consideration is composed of a primary and secondary BSs, as well as one primary and N secondary users served by R AF relays. Transmission power constraints are enforced on the secondary BS and a single selected relay to maintain a tolerable level of interference to the primary network. Accurate PEP expressions are derived and used to evaluate the BER union bound. Üstünbaş and Aygölü [199] propose a cooperative NOMA-based CR butterfly network. The system comprises a primary and secondary transmitters and receivers, and a single relay. The primary transmitter and secondary receiver share a cell, whereas the secondary transmitter and primary receiver share a different cell. During the first time slot, the QPSK modulated symbols are received simultaneously by the relay and nearby receivers. The relay uses MLD to directly detect the secondary transmitter signal, whereas the primary transmitter signal is obtained through SIC. In the second time slot, the relay generates a NOMA symbol from the detected symbols and forwards it to both receivers. Both receivers recover their respective symbols using SIC and MLD. The authors analyzed the BER performance for both users using QPSK modulation and while assuming imperfect SIC.

(p49.1) A two-user cooperative CR based NOMA is presented in [200]. Assuming there is no direct link between the BS and far-user, the communication is established through a single selected HD-AF relay from the R available ones. The NOMA signal is received by the relays and near-user, where the near-user detects its own signal using SIC. Meanwhile, the relay with the maximum SNR with respect to the far-user is selected for cooperation. In the next round, the selected relay forwards the far-user signal through controlled power to avoid interference with the near-user. Exact closed-form BER expression is derived over SISO Rayleigh fading channel for BPSK assuming perfect CSI at the relays. To preserve the near-user QoS, [201] proposes a cooperative spectrum sharing mechanism based on NOMA, where the secondary transmitter cooperates with the primary to achieve full rate through cooperative multiplexing. Under the assumption of perfect CSI, the proposed system is analyzed in terms of average BER for BPSK. A closed-form expression for the BER is obtained through series expansion and numerical integration. Hence, the obtained expression are found to be an accurate approximation for the BER.

## (s50) 5) VLC-BASED COOPERATIVE RELAYING SYSTEM
Number of References: 6

(p50.0) The authors of [202] study a multiuser cooperative VLC-NOMA. The LED broadcasts the OOK modulated NOMA signal through non-fading channels to N users. The users perform SIC to detect the individual signals. Therefore, the nearest user has to detect the signals of all other users, while the farthest user detects only its own signal. The second round is composed of N−1 time slots during which each user forwards the detected signals of other users. The cooperation ensures the link reliability for the far-users. Furthermore, the far-users use MRC and SIC to detect their desired signals. The exact BER of the proposed model is derived under the assumptions of perfect CSI and imperfect SIC.

(p50.1) In [42], the BER of an optical backhauled three-hop cooperative NOMA is derived. The first hop is from the source to the first relay, which is realized using FSO. The second hop between the first and second relay is realized using RF, and finally, the third hop to the end-user is performed using VLC. The RF node acts as an AF relay and the VLC node acts as a DF relay. The adopted system model and performance analysis consider various impairments such as fading caused by the atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, pathloss, photodiode responsitivity, and AWGN. The BER is evaluated only for a two-user NOMA using BPSK modulation.

(p53.0) State-of-the-Art NOMA-based IM-OFDM: Chen et al. [212] study a two-user cooperative NOMA-based IM-OFDM system. During the first time slot, the BS transmits the IM-OFDM information in a NOMA fashion to both users. The near-user performs SIC to detect its signal, while the faruser retains the received signal till the next slot. During the second time slot, the near-user acts as a relay and forwards the far-users signal. The far-user uses MRC-MLD to combine the signals received in the two time slots and detect its desired signal. Tight closed-form upper bound BER expressions are derived for both users over Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, Chen et al. [213] extend the work presented in [212] by proposing a low-complexity greedy detector, where they present tight closed-form upper bound BER expressions.

(p53.1) The authors of [214] derive the PEP of a DL two-user IM-OFDM-NOMA system over Rayleigh fading channels considering. Assuming the far-user symbols embedded in the indices of the activated subcarriers as well as the NOMA signal, the far-user performs JMLD to jointly detect its data from the OFDM signal and the indices of the active subcarrier. The near-user on the other hand performs SIC to detect its own signal. Furthermore, the authors of [215] consider N users in UL with SIMO settings. Assuming a single active subcarrier, closed-form PEP expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels considering JMLD for all users.

(p53.2) Dogan et al. [216] propose an IM-OFDM-NOMA system to reduce the impact of collision in GFA for ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC). Assuming a delaysensitive user and a delay-tolerating user, the former is allowed GFA which results in collisions between the two users. Therefore, to alleviate the adverse effects of collisions, the users are multiplexed through IM-OFDM. To obtain the frequency-domain signal for the delay-sensitive user, a portion of the bits are mapped to the standard constellation, which is then transmitted to the BS via a Rayleigh fading channel. To improve the delay-sensitive user's SNR, the NOMA signals received over multiple transmissions are combined and detected using MRC-MLD. The BER and SINR of the delay-sensitive user is analyzed. The probability of a subcarrier being active or inactive is taken into account when computing the average BER, which is derived in closed-form for BPSK and M n -QAM modulations. On the other hand, Shahab et al. [217] propose an IM-IM-single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA)-NOMA system to support massive machine type communication (mMTC). Assuming two-user system, the users' signals are detected at the BS by applying JMLD. Closed-form PEP expressions are derived for both the JMLD and SIC-based detectors.

The available bandwidth is divided into multiple orthogonal subcarriers, where the adjacent subcarriers are pooled to serve a subset of N users. For each user, the BS broadcasts a block of bits. These bits are split into two parts, where the first part is applied to a conventional M n -PSK modulator, while the second is used to determine the subcarriers' subset for transmission. The modulated symbols of different users on the same subcarriers are multiplexed in power-domain. The users perform optimal JMLD to estimate the individual signals. Average PEP expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels. propose a DL-NOMA system, which consists of a BS, a nearuser, and a far-user, each equipped with a single antenna. Unlike traditional NOMA, the BS uses random power level selection from a predefined set to improve SE. As a result, the transmitter conveys log 2 (number of power levels) additional bits alongside the actual transmitted symbols. Since the users are unaware of the dynamically changing power levels, a distinct constellation is designed for each power level to distinguish between them. The error rate performance of the system is evaluated using conditional PEP analysis, with a Rayleigh fading channel and M n -PAM modulation.

(p54.0) According to Shannon capacity theorem, the probability of decoding error approaches zero when the block length approaches infinity [50]. Therefore, the error probability deteriorates by reducing the block length. This type of communications is referred to as SPC and is crucial for URLLC applications. Hence, the error probability associated with SPC cannot be ignored. SPC is investigated in the context of NOMA to highlight the throughput and the error rate performance. Table 19 provides a summary of the work in this part. State-of-the-Art on NOMA-based SPC: The average BLER is analyzed for the DL-NOMA with SPC in [50], [222], [223], [224], [225], [226], [230], [235]. It is obtained by considering a linear approximation of the instantaneous BLER, PDF and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of users. It is noted that the derived expressions are a function of SINR, block length, and target rate.

(p54.1) A two-user DL NOMA system employing SPC is studied in [50], [222]. The authors of [50] analyzed the users' error probabilities in AWGN channels for coded system, and uncoded system given that imperfect SIC is considered and QPSK is adopted. In both cases, a PA optimization problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the error probability. On the other hand, Reference [222] considered Rayleigh fading channels. It is demonstrated that the blocklength can be represented as the function of users' power coefficients. The authors formulate an optimization problem in which the objective is to minimize the blocklength under average BLER constraints. Consequently, a closed-form expression for average BLER is derived to solve the optimization problem and to determine the best minimum blocklength for each user.

(p54.2) A multiuser DL-NOMA with SPC is investigated in [223] considering Nakagami-m fading channels. The authors derived analytical expressions for the average BLER considering perfect SIC. The expressions are obtained by utilizing the conditional BLER and the PDF. A linear function is used to approximate the complex integration required for the derivation. The CDF is constructed using the derived average BLER.

(p54.3) Yuan et al. [224] study the BLER performance of a DL-NOMA system considering SPC with Alamouti space-time block code. The BS is equipped with two antennas, while the two users have single antenna. Nakagami-m fading channel is assumed, where the channel remains constant across a twosymbol period. The instantaneous BLER is approximated and the CDF of the SINR under imperfect SIC assumption is derived. Closed-form BLER expressions are derived for both users using the instantaneous BLER and the corresponding CDFs. Furthermore, asymptotic expressions for the average BLER are derived to obtain the expressions for the minimum blocklengths for both users.

(p54.4) A secure two-user DL-NOMA with SPC is investigated in [225]. It is assumed that the far-user can eavesdrop on the signal transmitted to the near-user. While assuming imperfect SIC, and perfect CSI knowledge at all ends, the average secure BLER of the near-user for detecting and decoding its signal is derived over Rayleigh fading channels. Finally, an asymptotic average secure BLER is derived for the near-user via linear approximations. In [226], a hybrid long and short packet communication DL-NOMA is proposed, in which the near-user requests a long packet while the far-user requests a short packet. The analytical expression of the average BLER for the far-user is derived over Rayleigh fading channel considering linear approximations to simplify the analysis.

(p54.5) The performance of a two-user UL-NOMA system is presented in [228]. All nodes are equipped with a single antenna. A unified analysis is conducted for SPC for various fading channels, including lognormal-Nakagami-m, generalized K G , η − μ, Nakagami-q (Hoyt), κ − μ, Rician, Nakagami-m, and Rayleigh fading. While assuming imperfect CSI at the users, closed-form BLER expressions are derived. In [227], the authors analyze the performance of an N-user UL-NOMA system with SPC under the influence of channel estimation errors and RHI. The users are divided into several clusters, each consisting of a fixed number of users. The article proposes two decoding schemes: 1) fixed-order decoding, where the decoding order is determined based on the power levels, 2) dynamic decoding order, where the decoding order is determined by the instantaneous received powers. Closed-form BLER expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p54.6) The authors of [229] study the performance of a two-user UL-NOMA with hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) using SPC. Upon reception of negative acknowledgement by both users from the BS, the proposed scheme allows the higher power user to retransmit up to L times, while the lower power user transmits a new packet. The lower power user is allowed to retransmit only when the higher power user stops retransmission. The closed-form expressions for BLER are obtained for Rayleigh fading channels by employing a Markov model, assuming ideal CSI knowledge at all nodes, and utilizing MRC as well as imperfect SIC.

(p54.7) State-of-the-Art on SPC with CRS-NOMA: The authors of [230] study SPC for a two-user DL cooperative NOMA with user relaying. During the first time slot, the BS transmits a NOMA signal to both users. During the second time slot, the near-user acts as a HD-DF relay for the far-user after detecting the signals using SIC. The far-user combines the two received realizations during the two slots and combines them using SeC and MRC. The authors derive closed-form expressions for the BLER over Rayleigh fading channels considering linear approximation. In addition, an asymptotic BLER is computed for long packets.

(p54.8) Another SPC with DL-NOMA is discussed in [231]. The model consists of one source node, two NOMA users, and one selective DF-HD relay, where all nodes are equipped with a single antenna. While assuming perfect CSI at all nodes, the BLER is derived under Rayleigh fading channels and imperfect SIC conditions. Furthermore, separate analyses are performed at the far-user for SeC and MRC. In [232], an analytical framework for SPC with CRS-DL-NOMA over Nakagami-m fading channels is presented. The system consists of a source node, two NOMA users, and multiple DF-HD relays, each with a single antenna. The transmission is split into two time slots. During the first time slot, the transmitter broadcasts a NOMA signal to both users. If the far-user signal is successfully decoded by the near-user, it then implements SIC to obtain its signal; otherwise, the entire received NOMA sequence is cached. At the same time, the relays directly decode the received NOMA sequence to obtain the far-user signal. If failed to decode the far-user's signal, the relay is selected for transmission in the second time slot based on the resultant SINR at the relays and received SNR at the far-user. Otherwise, the relay is chosen based on the distance between the relays and the near-user, as well as the distance between the transmitter and the near-user. The goal of relay selection is to improve the near-user's reliability. The average BLER expressions are derived for the users under perfect and imperfect SIC assumptions.

(p54.9) Furthermore, DL-NOMA assisted SPC system is proposed in [233]. The system consists of a source and two NOMA users, with the near-user acting as a DF-FD relay and thus experiencing RSI. The fading channels between the nodes follow the Rayleigh distribution. The model assumes perfect SIC and perfect CSI conditions. There are two types of RSI models considered. One in which the RSI link is assumed to be free of fading and the other in which the RSI link follows Rayleigh fading. The expressions for average BLER are derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.

(p54.10) The authors of [234] present a novel approach, which involves a partial DF-AF relaying technique for a two-user UL-NOMA with SPC. In the first time slot, both users transmit their signals to the relay. The relay then employs partial SIC to decode the signal with higher receive power and re-encodes this within the received signal employing a modified PA. During the second time slot, the relay transmits this new NOMA signal to the BS. The BS then utilizes MRC and SIC to successfully decode the signals of the users. Upon a comparative analysis with the conventional DF, it is observed that the proposed technique is distinguished by its reduced complexity and enhanced security. Assuming that both the relay and the BS have multiple antennas, the authors derive closed-form BLER expressions over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p54.11) State-of-the-Art on SPC with CR-NOMA: In [235], a DL wireless-powered CR-NOMA IoT network with SPC is presented. The system consists of a BS, a secondary source node, multiple primary users and two secondary NOMA users. The secondary source node uses the energy harvested from the BS to transmit information to the near-and far-user using NOMA. All nodes, excluding the BS, are assumed to be equipped with a single antenna and to be operating in HD mode. The secondary source node adjusts its transmission power to avoid interfering with the primary users and meet their QoS requirements. The proposed system operates in two phases. The first phase involves the EH, while the second phase is the information transmission to the secondary users using NOMA. The authors derive approximate and asymptotic average BLER expressions. To obtain these expressions, the CDF is derived by using a linear approximation of the instantaneous BLER expression in order to deal with the complex Q-function. In addition, the concept of first order Riemann integral approximation is used to handle the multiple integration involved in the CDF. Finally, the simulation results are compared to the analytical solution and to the real-time configuration results obtained using the deep neural network technique.

(p54.12) The authors of [236] study the performance of an CR-NOMA with SPC. The system consists of a primary network with a primary user and a secondary network with secondary users. In an underlay fashion, the secondary network uses NOMA for broadcasting to the secondary users with a tolerable interference at the primary user. Assuming perfect CSI, closed-form BLER expressions are derived for the imperfect SIC over Nakagami-m fading channels. On the other hand, the authors of [237] consider the effect of imperfect CSI and analyze the BLER.

(p54.13) State-of-the-Art on SPC with VLC-NOMA: A theoretical framework is proposed in [238] to assess the efficiency of SPC in a DL-VLC system employing NOMA. It is assumed that perfect CSI is known to the transmitter and the users. In this system, a single transmitting LED establishes communication over VLC channel with two single-photodiode users. Under the assumption of imperfect SIC and perfect CSI, closed-form expressions for BLER are derived. Furthermore, the performance of the same system under the assumption of imperfect CSI knowledge is studied in [239].

(p54.14) State-of-the-Art on SPC with IRS-aided NOMA: Vu et al. [240] study the STAR-IRS-enabled NOMA with SPC. Assuming perfect knowledge of CSI and perfect SIC, approximate and asymptotic closed-form BLER expressions are derived for the discrete phase shift model over Rayleigh fading channels, where the direct link between the two users and BS is assumed absent. Furthermore, Vu et al. extend the work to multiple users in [241]. The authors of [242] consider the two-user scenario with imperfect SIC and derive closed-form BLER expressions for the continuous phase model over Nakagami-m fading channels, where the direct link between the BS and one of the users only is assumed available. Similarly, the authors of [243] consider a two-user model but with perfect SIC and statistical CSI knowledge. The authors derive closed-form BLER expressions for the continuous and discrete phase models over Rician fading channels, where the direct link between the users and BS is assumed absent. Yuan et al. [244] consider an IRS-aided NOMA with SPC.

(p58.0) As discussed in Section II, IRS can enhance the system performance by controlling the propagation of signals in the environment via passive smart metasurface elements. However, there are several challenges, such as acquiring channel estimates between all metasurface elements and users.

(p60.0) Higher frequency bands such as mmWave bands are currently used in the 5G standard to satisfy the growth in higher data requirements, since wider bandwidths are available at such frequencies. However, current trends indicate that THz bands, which are wider than millimeter bands, are considered a key technology for future wireless networks [25]. Nonetheless, the propagation limitations become more challenging and the communications would be directional and take place mostly in LoS environments.

(p62.0) Although several articles studied the impact of imperfect SIC and channel estimation errors as seen in Fig. 15, the literature works studying the impact of RHI, I/Q imbalance and phase noise are limited [125], [126], [178], [227]. In addition, problems including frame synchronization, time synchronization and carrier synchronization over the performance of NOMA systems are missing from the literature. Furthermore, the works of OFDM-NOMA systems reported in this survey mostly assume ideal conditions in terms of time and frequency synchronization, as well as cyclic prefix (CP) length which is assumed to be longer than the channel maximum delay spread, and hence the inter-symbol interference is removed perfectly. However, such ideal conditions cannot be achieved in practical scenarios, where imperfect time and frequency synchronization are likely to occur. Additionally, OFDM-NOMA is prone to user mobility, which introduces Doppler shift and loss of subcarriers orthogonality.

(p107.0) IRS and backscatter communications can be considered key solutions for enhancing the spectrum and energy efficiencies of future wireless communications systems [38], [39]. The main principle of both technologies is based on reflecting the incident signals towards an intended destination. While IRS aims at improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination, backscatter communications aim at reflecting radio frequency (RF) signals to a passive or low-power backscatter communications device. IRS consists of passive metasurface elements that control the reflection angle of the incident signals, whereas backscatter communications devices consist of an antenna and an energy harvesting (EH) circuit with or without a dedicated power source to support the communications and sensory systems. Combining NOMA with IRS or backscatter communications can improve the coverage and energy efficiency of the system by facilitating the delivery of several coherent copies of the signal to the receiver. Furthermore, an IRS-assisted NOMA system with multiple transmit antennas enable channel manipulation to achieve the capacity region [40]. Therefore, NOMA combined with IRS or backscatter communications are considered energy, spectrum and cost-efficient solution for future wireless networks.

Such a wide free spectrum can provide a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity problem. Nonetheless, the main limitation of VLC and FSO systems is that the achievable data rates are constrained by the modulation bandwidth of the LEDs which spans a few hundred megahertz, hence can only utilize a small fraction of the available bandwidth at such frequencies [44]. It is worth noting that NOMA is particularly suitable for DL-VLC systems that aim at connecting a few users in a small cell, which is aligned with the principle of NOMA and small cell densification.

(p109.0) Utilizing some devices to relay the signals of other ones is an effective solution to extend the network range and overcome channel impairments such as fading, pathloss and shadowing. There are two main categories of such a solution, which are user relaying and dedicated relaying [45]. In the former, idle users act as relays, while in the latter category, dedicated relay nodes are distributed in the network. In general, two time slots are needed to relay the signal to the destination when half-duplex (HD) mode is considered, whereas one time slot is needed by the full-duplex (FD) mode. It is worth noting that high complexity and self-interference are the two main limitations for the FD mode. A simple network structure for dedicated user relaying in NOMA is that the near-user acts as a HD relay for the far-user either through decode-and-forward (DF) or amplify-and-forward (AF). In AF, a scaled version of the received signal is sent to the destination, while an attempt to detect the signal is made, then retransmission of the detected information takes place for DF.

(p115.0) When considering the analysis for given channel realizations, the DL analysis can be extended to UL directly. However, to get the average performance, then N-fold integration should be considered because N channel realizations affect the received signal at the BS. This makes the analysis challenging, therefore, different approaches are introduced to solve this issue. For example, the authors of [55] used the union bound for the outer integration and exponential bound for the inner integration. The total probability theorem and Taylor series expansion are then applied to get the average BER. Kara and Kaya in [46] utilized the fact that the channel realizations are independent and got the PDF of the joint channels.

(p116.0) The PA scheme affects the error rate performance, and hence, it is a crucial aspect to discuss. Generally speaking, there are two main PA schemes, which are fixed PA and adaptive PA. The former ensures minimum signaling overhead and low complexity owing to its non-optimality, whereas the latter can ensure optimality or sub-optimality but with higher signaling overhead and complexity [34]. A number of issues should be considered when designing both schemes. First, ambiguity at the receivers. For example, ambiguity can be caused at the receivers for two NOMA users with binary phase shift keying (BPSK) if equal power coefficients are given when x 1 = −x 2 . Hence, two NOMA symbols will coincide on the same constellation point.

(p116.1) Moreover, enabling reliable detection using SIC requires abiding by certain power coefficient bounds (PCBs) [34], [47], [56], [57], [58]. Considering the previous example, when α 1 < α 2 the order of the NOMA symbols is as follows from the negative in-phase axis: 11, 01, 10, 00. In such a scenario, MLD can detect b 2 reliably because b 2 = 0 is always in the positive side. Hence, SIC can cancel the interference caused by b 2 and detect b 1 reliably. In contrast, when α 1 > α 2 , the two middle symbols swap order causing b 2 = 0 to fall in two different regions. Therefore, MLD will not be able to detect b 2 correctly, and hence the SIC performance will be unreliable. It is worth noting that this problem is not encountered when JMLD is used.

## (s117) G. USER PAIRING
Number of References: 9

(p117.0) User pairing is the scheduler's process of selecting a set of users to share the same communication resource. In a DL/UL coordinated scenario, the BS acts as a centralized unit to coordinate the user pairing process to achieve a certain objective. For example, the objective could be the sum rate maximization while satisfying certain quality of service (QoS) constraints such as minimum rate per user or maximum BER per user. Also, user pairing can aim to ensure fairness among users. Furthermore, the satisfaction of such objectives and constraints depends on the network knowledge available at the scheduler. For instance, user pairing can satisfy certain criteria instantaneously if the CSI knowledge of all links is available instantaneously. Alternatively, such criteria can be satisfied on average if statistical CSI knowledge is available. For instance, it is reported that pairing users with the most distinct channel gains would maximize the sum rate in NOMA systems. The concept of prioritizing users with different priorities is known as cognitive radio (CR)-NOMA in which the primary user is given the highest priority while the secondary user is served opportunistically. Moreover, CR-NOMA tends to pair the best channel user with the second best channel user [59]. On the other hand, the UL decentralized scenario usually refers to the grant free access (GFA) in which the users are allowed random access to the channel without resource allocation. Hence, collisions might occur where the BS needs to detect collisions and resolve them in order to detect the messages.

Unlike single carrier systems [96], maximizing the sum-rate in multicarrier systems is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problem that requires highly complex exhaustive search [92], [93]. Therefore, it is important to design efficient algorithms. Cejudo et al. [92] design an efficient resource allocation algorithm to maximize the sum-rate while satisfying the BER constraints. Accurate instantaneous BER expressions are presented for square M n -QAM considering imperfect SIC. These expressions are used to derive the exact optimal channel gain ratios between a pair of NOMA users, maximizing the achievable sum-rate for a given BER constrain. To ensure reliable SIC detection, the power coefficient for equally-spaced constellation points or highly separable constellation points groups is presented in closed-form. The exact optimal channel gain ratios and the approximated BER expressions over Rayleigh flat fading channel are used to design an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm which involves user pairing algorithm and continuous power and rate allocation. It is worthy to mention that when NOMA is infeasible, the subcarrier is not used. Moreover, control channel is used to inform the users about the rate, power and subcarrier assignment.

The design considers optimizing the transmission mode (TM) by the BS which tunes the modulation orders and power coefficients while satisfying the BLER requirement for each user. Two PA schemes are considered: 1) Fixed PA based on linear mapping. 2) Adaptive PA. The former optimization is solved using integer programming while the latter is solved using mixed-integer programming. In addition, the computational complexity is reduced using an efficient terminating criterion, segment-line search, and quantized SNRs. Approximated closed-form BLER expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels. The authors extend their work in [95] by proposing the min-max method to solve the fixed PA optimization. Such a method reduces the complexity and the number of TMs significantly while improving the throughput of the system. The authors of [96] propose a joint adaptive power and modulation order to maximize the SER without sacrificing the BER performance, where the BER expressions of NOMA over Rayleigh fading are approximated as OMA counterpart.

## (s126) 2) MINIMUM BER DESIGN
Number of References: 90

(p126.0) References [49], [50], [98], [99] formulate several optimization problems to minimize the error performance of DL-NOMA systems. For example, the objective function in [49] is to minimize the instantaneous SER of the strong user while satisfying the SER requirement for the weak user. The instantaneous SER is derived in closed-form for both users considering M n -QAM and M n -PAM. Nonetheless, a closed-form suboptimal PA is derived. The authors of [50] propose a line search algorithm for a two-user system to find the optimal power coefficients that minimize the un/coded NOMA system overall error performance in AWGN channels. BER is considered and derived for the uncoded QPSK, while the SPC BER approximation is considered for the coded system. The work is extended in [98] to consider square M n -QAM, where the BER is approximated using the SER expressions derived for AWGN channels. These expressions are used to find the optimal power coefficients that minimize the instantaneous overall system BER. The optimization problem is simplified by obtaining upper and lower bounds of the overall BER.

(p126.1) Dutta [99] approximates the closed-form BER expressions using the SER expressions that are derived for an arbitrary number of DL-NOMA users, considering arbitrary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and perfect SIC. These expressions have been used for power allocation optimization such that the average BER among all users is minimized while satisfying certain minimum rate requirements per user. Since the problem is non-convex, an upper bound approximation is used for the objective function to make it convex, while the concave rate is transformed to be convex. As the probability of error considers all the possible realizations of the input vector, it is computationally difficult to handle the objective function. Hence, a faster approach is developed to find the optimal power coefficients, which is based on splitting the data sets into subsets and running the optimization for all subsets in parallel.

(p126.2) Optimizing the error rate performance of the UL-NOMA system is studied in [100] which derives closed-form optimal power coefficients and phases to maximize the minimum ED of the sum of the constellations of two-user NOMA with square M n -QAM, while JMLD is used at the receiver. The resulting sum constellation is found to be a uniform M-QAM constellation of a larger size. Mixed-integer optimization is used to formulate the problem, where the complex Rayleigh fading channel is decomposed into symmetrical real and imaginary parts. Only one part is analyzed due to symmetry.

(p126.3) In a different category, optimal closed-form SINR-balancing is derived in [101] for two-user case assuming imperfect CSI. This scheme can provide fairness between the users, however, the performance is not guaranteed.

The authors of [50] propose a line search algorithm for a two-user system to find the optimal power coefficients that minimize the un/coded NOMA system overall error performance in AWGN channels. BER is considered and derived for the uncoded QPSK, while the SPC BER approximation is considered for the coded system. The work is extended in [98] to consider square M n -QAM, where the BER is approximated using the SER expressions derived for AWGN channels. These expressions are used to find the optimal power coefficients that minimize the instantaneous overall system BER. The optimization problem is simplified by obtaining upper and lower bounds of the overall BER.

These expressions have been used for power allocation optimization such that the average BER among all users is minimized while satisfying certain minimum rate requirements per user. Since the problem is non-convex, an upper bound approximation is used for the objective function to make it convex, while the concave rate is transformed to be convex. As the probability of error considers all the possible realizations of the input vector, it is computationally difficult to handle the objective function. Hence, a faster approach is developed to find the optimal power coefficients, which is based on splitting the data sets into subsets and running the optimization for all subsets in parallel.

The resulting sum constellation is found to be a uniform M-QAM constellation of a larger size.

(p128.0) The error rate performance of NOMA is highly impacted by the symbol-to-bit labeling strategy used, [102], [103], [104], [105], [106]. There are three main labeling strategies which are: 1) NOMA non-Gray labeling, 2) Joint Gray labeling, 3) Natural labeling. The NOMA non-Gray labeling results naturally from the SC process. An example is shown in Fig. 5a. On the other hand, the joint Gray labeling is simply performed such that the NOMA word becomes Gray coded. This is done before SC on each user stream of bits, b n , such that the stream of bits after joint Gray coding is
## (s130) State-of-the-Art on NOMA with Constellation Rotation:
Number of References: 45

(p130.0) The work in [107] studies constellation rotation for the DL scenario with two users each of which is using QPSK. Because deriving exact closed-form SER expressions is challenging due to the arrangement of the NOMA constellation points, upper bounds on the SER are presented based on the union bound of the PEPs. These expressions are used for rotation angles optimization which is performed using exhaustive search. Chang and Fukawa [108] derive the optimal rotation angles that minimize ED between the NOMA constellation points for the two-user case while considering identical QPSK and QPSK with 16-QAM. Furthermore, the work is extended to the three-user case using QPSK in [109], where the optimal phase rotation is found for two schemes which are: 1) rotation for the near-user. 2) rotation for the near-user and the composite of near and middle users. Reference [110] studies two users NOMA with QPSK and finds the rotation angle that minimizes the dominant PEP, which translates to maximizing the smallest ED. It is found that the optimal rotation angle depends on the ratio of the assigned power coefficients and phase differences between the channel coefficients for UL, while it only depends on the ratio of the assigned power coefficients for DL. The work is extended in [111] by jointly optimizing the power coefficients and rotation angles. In [112], the authors propose phase pre-distortion for UL VLC-NOMA system to improve the SER. Assuming that the phase difference between the channels of the two users is uniformly distributed, closed-form SER expressions are derived considering QPSK for both users and SIC at the receiver. The optimal rotation angle that minimizes the SER is found to be the one that ensures 0 • relative phase, i.e., angle that causes co-phasing. Closed-form optimal rotation angles were derived for single and multi-receiving antenna cases. The joint optimization problem reduces to a piece-wise convex optimization problem over its sub-domains, for which the global maximum solution is obtained in closed-form. The work in [113] proposes an algebraic rotation approach to design DL-NOMA for two users while achieving full diversity and improved BER performance. This improvement gained due to the special lattice partition scheme that ensures maximum minimum product distance. The upper bound of the minimum product distance is derived in closed-form for arbitrary power coefficients for the two dimensional lattice. The work is generalized in [114] for multi-dimensional lattices. It is worthy to mention that the design and analysis are applicable to the JMLD rather than SIC, which imposes high complexity at the receiver, but reduces the decoding delay. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional NOMA and the scheme proposed in [107] in fast and block fading channels.

(p130.1) Ye et al. [115] study a two-user multi-antenna UL-NOMA with SIC utilizing constellation rotation. Optimal rotation angles are found to maximize the mutual information (MI) where the signal is modeled as a Gaussian mixture model. The MI maximization problem has high computational complexity because it is a bivariate problem. Hence, it is transformed to an entropy maximization problem that involves only a single random variable. Efficient closed-form approximation is derived using variational approximation. Improved sum-rate and lower BER are obtained when compared to conventional NOMA. Constellation rotation with space-time line code (STLC) is considered in [55] for two-user UL-NOMA, where the BS is equipped with two receiving antennas and each user is equipped with a single antenna. The channel between each user and each receiving antenna at the BS is assumed to be quasi-static for two time slots and known to the user. Hence, spatial diversity can be obtained using STLC-encoding. Assuming that QPSK is used by both users and constellation rotation is applied to one user only, upper bound expressions for the average BER are derived for the JMLD using the union bound of the PEPs. Additionally, an approximation is derived for high SNRs using Taylor series.

(p130.2) The authors of [116] propose a novel scheme for the single antenna DL-NOMA based on coordinate interleaving for a general number of users, where M n -pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) constellation is rotated by π/4 rad counter clock-wise. Because the real and imaginary components of the π/4 M n -PAM constellation are equal, then coordinate interleaving for the two-user case results in

(p130.3) It is worth noting that x sc in its current form does not have a unity average power. In fact E[|x sc | 2 ] = 2. Therefore, it has to be normalized for a fair comparison with the conventional NOMA system. Additionally, this scheme eliminates the need for using SIC at the receiver for the two-user case, while it reduces the number of SIC operations by more than half when there is more than two users in the system. Furthermore, closed-form SER expressions are derived for the two-user, as well as the optimal power coefficients that achieve fairness. A DL-NOMA scheme for a cluster of four users is proposed in [117] by utilizing phase rotation to achieve a lower BER and higher sum rate. The optimal rotation angle is determined to maximize the minimum distance between symbols, thereby improving overall system performance. Furthermore, the optimal power allocation is determined by minimizing both the inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances in the NOMA signal. The proposed method reduces the overall complexity by eliminating the need for SIC between subgroup multiplexing. Exact BER and union bound on BER expressions are derived for all users using M n -PSK or M n -QAM in a Rayleigh fading channel.

(p130.4) In [118], a constellation rotation technique is proposed for an UL-NOMA based IoT network to enhance performance. It is assumed that perfect CSI is available to the transmitting nodes, where each transmitter is equipped with a single antenna and the access point employs two antennas. The upper bounds on the BER over Rayleigh fading channels are derived for the case with two transmitters and QPSK. Both dynamic and fixed constellation rotation scenarios are considered, and optimal rotation angles are determined for a given SNR to improve the BER.

(p130.5) Reddy et al. [119] propose optimal constellation rotation for the two-user DL-NOMA system considering M n -PSK signaling over correlated SIMO Rician channels. By modifying the NOMA SC as follows,

(p131.0) Multiuser interference generally causes performance degradation for NOMA users. However, constructive interference may improve the performance as the desired signal power is boosted by the interference. On the other hand, destructive interference degrades the performance of NOMA. Therefore, the concept of interference alignment is to design the individual users' signals such that they add constructively. This can be achieved via phase rotation [127], [128], [129] or symbol scaling [130], [131]. A summary of the work on interference alignment is given in Table 9.

(p132.0) The work in [127] proposes a constellation rotation scheme for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-assisted NOMA to maximize the energy transmitted to the wireless information transfer (WIT) users and wireless power transfer (WPT) users, while satisfying acceptable SER performance for the WIT users. To minimize the signaling overhead associated with informing the WIT receivers about the optimal rotation angles, the constellation rotation is performed jointly over a block of symbols rather  than on a symbol-by-symbol basis. The optimal constellation rotation angles are derived for QPSK case assuming two NOMA WIT users and a single WPT user. The work is extended in [128] by considering a multi-carrier system, arbitrary modulation orders, and multi WIT and WPT users. A joint design of the energy interleaver and constellation rotation is proposed, where the energy interleaver is introduced to suppress the destructive interference of multiple symbols scheduled on each subcarrier. Furthermore, the receiver operations for WIT and WPT users as well as the signaling overhead are discussed thoroughly. An iterative algorithm is proposed for obtaining optimal the constellation rotation angles since the objective function is non-convex. Whereas a low-complexity greedy algorithm is proposed for the energy interleaver integer optimization. In [129], phase rotation is applied to the near-user to allow constructive interference with the far-user symbol. In addition, a nonredundunt precoding is applied to the near-user symbol to allow symbol extraction at the receiver. The authors propose a semi-blind detection scheme based on independent component analysis to detect the near-user symbols after rotation. Nonetheless, it requires 1-2 pilot symbols to remove ambiguities caused by the independent component analysis. The SER is derived in closed-form under Rayleigh fading for two users with QPSK assuming perfect ambiguity elimination. Additionally, an efficient power allocation algorithm that is based on statistical channel information is proposed to minimize the average asymptotic SER. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the scheme is studied and compared with other common benchmarks, such as [108], [111].

## (s134) D. CHANNEL CODING
Number of References: 27

(p134.0) Channel coding is a well-known approach to reduce the error probability of digital communications systems at the cost of higher complexity at the transmitter and the receiver. Thus, studying the complexity and error rate performance of NOMA-based channel coding transceivers is pivotal. Typical channel coding schemes include low-density parity-check (LDPC) [132], [133], Reed-Solomon codes [132], trellis coded modulation (TCM) [134], polar codes [135], turbo codes [136], and repetition codes [137]. A comprehensive summary for the NOMA work with channel coding is depicted in Table 10.

(p134.1) State-of-the-Art on NOMA with Channel Coding: The authors of [132] propose a novel linear receiver that exploits the constraints of the forward error correcting (FEC) codes to mitigate the SIC error propagation caused by the imperfect CSI at the receiver, where the channel frequency response is estimated by interpolating the responses of the pilot subcarriers. The novel receiver is applicable to symbol and codeword-level SIC. It is designed for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-user UL-NOMA based on the minimum output energy criterion that can handle moderate channel estimation errors, where the IUIs are separated from the desired signals by adopting a unique signature based on the FEC codes' constraints. The receiver optimization is formulated as a quadratic programming problem anchored with set of code constraints. Transmit diversity and capacityachieving LDPC codes are considered. To improve the performance further, an iterative receiver is designed to recover the Reed-Solomon coded data that is serially concatenated to an LDPC code. To verify the reliability of the proposed detector, an upper bound for the coded BER is derived based on the union bound of the PEPs. The authors of [133] propose probabilistic shaping combined with QAM for N UL-NOMA users in Rayleigh fading channels to improve the SER. Probabilistic shaping assigns the constellation points that have equidistance space different probabilities such that the source generates information symbols with non-uniform probabilities using a constant composition distribution matcher method. To maximize the ergodic constrained capacity, a multi-step optimization is performed to find the optimal probability mass function for each user, where the optimization order is the inverse of the SIC order. At the receiver, maximum a posterior (MAP)based codeword-level SIC is implemented with an order determined by the large-scale pathloss. Unlike the symbollevel SIC, the codeword-level SIC can ideally cancel the IUI caused by the previously decoded signals due to the powerful error correcting codes as well as the soft channel decoder. Whereas the rest IUIs are assumed to be Gaussian distributed.

(p135.0) In [138], wavelet transform pulse shaping is analyzed for the DL OFDM NOMA as it is more spectrally efficient than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pulse shaping which requires cyclic prefix. Closed-form BER expressions are derived for both pulse shaping schemes in AWGN channels based on the ED approach, where the presented analysis holds for two-user case with QPSK assuming ideal synchronization. The strong channel user applies SIC to detect its signal, whereas the weak channel user detects its signal assuming that the other user signal being in the noise floor. The effect of the AWGN on the received signal is studied after passing the AWGN components through the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) filter banks and getting their true variances. Since the high frequency components are discarded in the DWT filter banks, the channel effect on the received signal is reduced and the signal recovery is improved.

(p135.1) Maatouk et al. [139] propose combining orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA) for DL-NOMA. Unlike conventional NOMA which for example combines two users and uses SIC to cancel the interference, the proposed scheme combines two groups of users with two sets of orthogonal waveforms and uses iterative SIC to cancel the interference between the groups. The users in the OFDMA group can detect their signal directly as the number of the users in the CDMA group is assumed to be small such that the interference is negligible. On the other hand, the users of the CDMA group need to use iterative SIC to cancel the interference. Khansa et al. [140] extend the work by introducing a power split between the two groups that follows the conventional NOMA. Approximate BER expressions are derived for QPSK case in AWGN channel by assuming the interference being a Gaussian-like signal for the OFDMA group of users, while the number of possible sequence errors for the CDMA group is assumed to follow the binomial distribution.

(p137.0) Haci et al. [142] study the asynchronous UL-NOMA system as perfect synchronization is difficult to achieve for UL users distributed in geographically diverse and dynamic environments. They propose a novel triangular-SIC detector which uses multiple symbols from each interfering user in a triangular pattern to carry out interference cancellation, where iterative soft and hard decision detectors are studied for higher modulation orders. The BER performance analysis is presented in [143] for the three-user case in flat Rayleigh fading considering conventional SIC and the proposed SIC, where besides the receiver power ratios, the BER of the proposed SIC depends also on the iteration number and the time offset between users. It is assumed that the relative time offset between the users is uniformly distributed, and the residual interference is approximated to the Gaussian distribution.

The detector is based on the triangular-SIC introduced by [142], [143] where an optimal time-offset is selected to eliminate the IUI. The optimal time offset is found to be half the symbol duration for the QPSK case. It is worth mentioning that the proposed detector does not introduce signaling overhead nor higher complexity, however, it requires the received symbol timing. Exact BER expressions are derived over AWGN channel considering two-user case with QPSK and imperfect SIC, where no relative phase rotation is assumed between the users. Additionally, a simpler BER approximation is derived for the weak user by relaxing the correlation between the noise samples at the detector. Furthermore, Liu et al. [145] derive closed-form SER expressions over Rayleigh fading channels for the asynchronous UL-NOMA with triangular SIC. The SER expressions are obtained for scenarios involving multiple users and arbitrary M n -QAM orders. Additionally, a novel parallel triangular SIC detection method is proposed, demonstrating superior interference suppression capabilities compared to the iterative triangular SIC approach.

(p137.2) The authors of [146] propose a three-stage cyclic triangular-SIC detector for the asynchronous UL-NOMA with transmission repetition. The stages are: 1) Optimization: By determining an optimal interference cancellation triangle under QoS constraints, it maximizes the number of data symbols to be decoded at the receiver 2) Decoding using triangular-SIC. 3) Retransmission, where stages 1 and 2 are repeated until all N user data are decoded.

The BER performance analysis is presented in [143] for the three-user case in flat Rayleigh fading considering conventional SIC and the proposed SIC, where besides the receiver power ratios, the BER of the proposed SIC depends also on the iteration number and the time offset between users.

Huang et al. [151] attempt to characterize the SER by analytically deriving the SER expressions considering multiple LEDs, unipolar transmission and line-of-sight (LoS) optical channels that are corrupted by AWGN. The PDF of the optical channel is obtained using the change of variable method, while the SER derivation is simplified using convolution theory and subsection integral method. Marshoud et al.

Hence, they propose an adjustable bit-rate SC such that each user bit interval is multiple base intervals, where the base interval is the bit interval of the lowest bit rate. Unlike the conventional SIC, the sample-and-sum SIC is introduced to minimize the error propagation caused by the conventional SIC, where each user samples the SC signal at a certain sample rate. Then, these samples will be summed for decoding. Moreover, a modified fixed power allocation is proposed to provide some clear correlation between the effects of adjusting power coefficients and the BER performance. The authors derive closed-form BER expressions for the multiuser scenario with OOK. Furthermore, the authors of [157] propose using OOK for the low data rate user, while MPPM is assigned for the high data rate user. To overcome the error propagation, a SICfree detector is proposed, where the MPPM user uses soft decision detector, whereas the OOK user sums the detected samples and uses MLD to detect its signal. A closed-form SER expression is derived for the OOK user, while a singleintegral form SER expression is derived for the MPPM user. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation for the probability of the number of erroneously detected slots in one MPPM symbol is derived.

(p145.0) The authors of [172] study the performance of the UL bistatic backscatter communications-aided NOMA for IoT sensors. Two backscatter nodes are co-located near the carrier emitter assuming interference-free channels. The backscatter nodes operate in two modes, namely the EH mode and the active mode, in which performing intentional impedance mismatch at the antenna input, produces two reflection coefficients to modulate the carrier signal with BPSK. The Nakagami-m fading channel multiplexes the modulated BPSK symbols in the power domain using NOMA. The backscatter reader receives the NOMA symbol and performs SIC for detection. As the analysis of such a problem is challenging, closed-from BER expressions are derived by ignoring the phases of the channels between the backscatter nodes and the backscatter reader. Also, the channels are assumed to be ordered, however, order statistics are not used. Rather than considering double-integration with respect to the Nakagami-m fading coefficients, the sum and difference of the fading coefficients are approximated by another Nakagami-m random variables.

(p145.1) The authors of [173] study the BER performance of a backscatter-assisted NOMA with PLNC. The system model under study considers two clusters and two users per cluster, namely the near and far clusters which want to exchange data. Hence, PLNC is used, where the near cluster pair and the far cluster pair transmit their data to the access point using UL-NOMA in two time slots. Once these symbols are detected using JMLD, PLNC performs exclusive OR operations and sends the PLNC symbols using DL-NOMA in the third time slot. Then the users in each cluster use SIC to detect the symbols. Upper bound BER expressions are derived for the end-to-end system using BPSK and exponential channel. It is worth mentioning that the ambient backscatter is located near the far cluster pair and is only used during the third time slot. A comprehensive summary of the NOMA work with IRS and backscatter communications is given in Table 14.

(p145.3) The authors of [173] study the BER performance of a backscatter-assisted NOMA with PLNC. The system model under study considers two clusters and two users per cluster, namely the near and far clusters which want to exchange data. Hence, PLNC is used, where the near cluster pair and the far cluster pair transmit their data to the access point using UL-NOMA in two time slots. Once these symbols are detected using JMLD, PLNC performs exclusive OR operations and sends the PLNC symbols using DL-NOMA in the third time slot. Then the users in each cluster use SIC to detect the symbols. Upper bound BER expressions are derived for the end-to-end system using BPSK and exponential channel. It is worth mentioning that the ambient backscatter is located near the far cluster pair and is only used during the third time slot. A comprehensive summary of the NOMA work with IRS and backscatter communications is given in Table 14.

(p145.4) The authors of [172] study the performance of the UL bistatic backscatter communications-aided NOMA for IoT sensors. Two backscatter nodes are co-located near the carrier emitter assuming interference-free channels. The backscatter nodes operate in two modes, namely the EH mode and the active mode, in which performing intentional impedance mismatch at the antenna input, produces two reflection coefficients to modulate the carrier signal with BPSK. The Nakagami-m fading channel multiplexes the modulated BPSK symbols in the power domain using NOMA. The backscatter reader receives the NOMA symbol and performs SIC for detection. As the analysis of such a problem is challenging, closed-from BER expressions are derived by ignoring the phases of the channels between the backscatter nodes and the backscatter reader. Also, the channels are assumed to be ordered, however, order statistics are not used. Rather than considering double-integration with respect to the Nakagami-m fading coefficients, the sum and difference of the fading coefficients are approximated by another Nakagami-m random variables.

(p147.0) Kara and Kaya [174], [175], consider a diamond-shaped CRS based on NOMA, with two HD-DF relays and a single destination. It is assumed that one relay is located at a far distance from the source, while the other relay is located closer. The transmission is accomplished in two time slots. During the first time slot, the source transmits a NOMA symbol of two BPSK modulated signals to both relays. The far relay employs single-user MLD, whereas the near relay uses SIC. In the second time slot, both relays use the UL-NOMA concept to forward the detected information to the destination. Finally, the signal received from the near relay is detected by the destination, while the signal received from the far relay is detected using SIC. For both time slots, the authors derive the BER over a SISO Rayleigh fading channel. Moreover, Kara and Kaya [176] consider a two-user DL-CRS with a single HD-DF relay located closer to the near-user, where no direct link exists between the users and BS. In the first time slot, the PA is applied in a reversed order, i.e., the power allocated to the near-user is larger than the power allocated to the far-user. However, the PA in the second time slot follows the conventional approach. It is worth noting that the SIC decoding order depends on the PA. Exact closedform BER expression is derived for identical QPSK with imperfect CSI over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p147.1) Kara et al. [177] propose using NOMA for a single-user CRS to overcome the SER degradation inherent to HD mode. In the proposed model, the source multiplexes two consecutive symbols as a NOMA symbol, where the first symbol x 1 is treated as the near-user, and thus it is allocated less power than the second symbol x 2 , the NOMA symbol is then transmitted to a HD-DF relay and to the destination. During the first time slot, the destination detects only x 2 while treating x 1 to be in the noise floor. The relay detects x 1 using SIC and forwards it to the destination in the second time slot. Exact closed-form BER expression is derived for BPSK over Nakagami-m fading channels. Further, the authors propose a machine learning PA algorithm to minimize the BER.

(p147.2) The RHIs of a multiuser DL-NOMA CRS that consists of a single HD-AF relay is studied in [178]. The users are considered to be within close proximity of each other, and they do not have a direct link with the BS. Assuming imperfect SIC, PEP expressions are derived over ordered Rayleigh fading channels. In [179], a two-user DL-NOMA CRS with R HD-DF relays is investigated, with each user having a dedicated relay that is selected based on a max-min criterion. It is assumed that no direct link exists between the BS and users. The far-user, which is a high-priority user, applies MLD for detection, while the near-user, which is a delay-tolerant user, applies SIC for detection. The average BER expressions are derived for BPSK over Rayleigh fading channels. In [180], a two-user UL-NOMA CRS with a single HD-AF relay is studied, where both users are at the cell edge and no direct link exists with the BS. In the first time slot, both users transmit their signals to the relay using UL-NOMA. In the second time slot, the relay applies linear noise reduction to the NOMA signal, the signal is then amplified and transmitted to the BS, which uses SIC for detection. Approximate SER is derived analytically which is accurate at high SNRs.

(p147.3) In [181], a two-user DL cooperative NOMA is investigated. The users and the relay have a single antenna each. Moreover, the relay operates in HD mode. The BER expressions are derived assuming Rayleigh fading channels between the transmitter and receivers, with BPSK modulation, imperfect CSI, and imperfect SIC. Althunibat et al. [182] study a two-way relaying system that improves the spectral efficiency by allowing two users to exchange data bi-directionally through two intermediate HD-DF relays in a PLNC fashion. In particular, during the first time slot, each user sends its DL-NOMA intended to the two relays. Consequently, the signals received at the relays follow the UL-NOMA principle. Each relay performs JMLD to detect its signals from the two users and combine them following PLNC principle. During the second time slot, the relays send the PLNC signal to the users following the UL-NOMA principle. Finally, given that each user knows its transmitted signals, it can detect the other user's signal using JMLD. The authors derive closed-form BER expressions over Rayleigh fading channels. The authors of [183] study a DL-NOMA CRS for hybrid satellite-terrestrial communication. During the first time slot, the satellite transmits to a ground destination and a ground relay. During the second time slot, the ground DF relay simultaneously transmits to the ground destination and a cellular user using DL-NOMA. Assuming imperfect SIC and co-channel interference, the authors derive closed-form SER expressions over shadowed Rician fading channels.

Reference [185] considers a similar model to [184] but imperfect CSI is assumed. Both the exact and asymptotic closed-form BER expressions are derived for the Rayleigh fading channels.

Assuming that the direct link between the BS and the far use exists, the far-user uses MRC to combine the two signals received from the BS and the relay. Closed-form BER expressions are derived for both users over SISO Rayleigh fading channels assuming M n -QAM. It is worth noting that the analysis for the near-user is performed considering imperfect SIC. Furthermore, the optimum threshold that minimizes the BER is derived. By relaxing the threshold condition for relaying, the work in [187] derives the BER expressions, where QPSK and BPSK are used by the near-and far-user, respectively. Jain et al.

(p149.0) Similar to the system model in [186], [187], the authors of [192] consider the near-user to be a SWIPT-enabled relay for the far-user, where the link between the BS and far-user does not exist. The proposed model is shown in Fig. 12. The union bound on the PEPs over ordered Rayleigh fading channels is derived for the near-and faruser while taking the AF and DF relaying protocols into account. It is worth noting that the analytical results are validated only for BPSK. Moreover, the authors of [193] extend the work to N users, while assuming AF relay. Closed-form PEP expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels. In [194], a cooperative NOMA system with SWIPT-enabled relay is investigated. The system model generally follows the one in [177] except that the relay harvests energy from the received NOMA signal during the first phase. Closed-form average BER is derived for BPSK modulation. In addition, machine learning is used to optimize the power sharing-power allocation to minimize the BER. Khennoufa et al. [195] study a cooperative DL-NOMA with EH, where the DF relay harvests the energy from the RF transmitted from the BS. Closed-form BER expressions over Nakagami-m fading channels are derived for a hybrid EH, i.e., power-time splitting, and EH techniques including time-splitting and power-splitting.

(p149.1) A SISO cooperative DL-NOMA for N SWIPT-enabled HD-AF relays and N users is proposed in [196]. The relays harvest energy from the received NOMA signal for a certain time, whereas the residual time is used to amplify and transmit the signal to the users. The exact and approximate PEP expressions are derived for all users. In [197], the cooperative NOMA is investigated, where a single SWIPT-enabled relay from the total of R relays is selected during the broadcast phase for cooperation between the transmitter and N users.

The relay is selected based on the channel quality between the transmitter and the corresponding relay. Each relay is assumed to operate in HD mode using the AF protocol. Rayleigh fading channel is considered for all links. The work derives an exact PEP expression assuming an imperfect SIC.

(p150.0) In [198], an underlay CR scenario in a SISO cooperative DL-NOMA is presented. As shown in Fig. 13, the system under consideration is composed of a primary and secondary BSs, as well as one primary and N secondary users served by R AF relays. Transmission power constraints are enforced on the secondary BS and a single selected relay to maintain a tolerable level of interference to the primary network. Accurate PEP expressions are derived and used to evaluate the BER union bound. Üstünbaş and Aygölü [199] propose a cooperative NOMA-based CR butterfly network. The system comprises a primary and secondary transmitters and receivers, and a single relay. The primary transmitter and secondary receiver share a cell, whereas the secondary transmitter and primary receiver share a different cell. During the first time slot, the QPSK modulated symbols are received simultaneously by the relay and nearby receivers. The relay uses MLD to directly detect the secondary transmitter signal, whereas the primary transmitter signal is obtained through SIC. In the second time slot, the relay generates a NOMA symbol from the detected symbols and forwards it to both receivers. Both receivers recover their respective symbols using SIC and MLD. The authors analyzed the BER performance for both users using QPSK modulation and while assuming imperfect SIC.

(p150.1) A two-user cooperative CR based NOMA is presented in [200]. Assuming there is no direct link between the BS and far-user, the communication is established through a single selected HD-AF relay from the R available ones. The NOMA signal is received by the relays and near-user, where the near-user detects its own signal using SIC. Meanwhile, the relay with the maximum SNR with respect to the far-user is selected for cooperation. In the next round, the selected relay forwards the far-user signal through controlled power to avoid interference with the near-user. Exact closed-form BER expression is derived over SISO Rayleigh fading channel for BPSK assuming perfect CSI at the relays. To preserve the near-user QoS, [201] proposes a cooperative spectrum sharing mechanism based on NOMA, where the secondary transmitter cooperates with the primary to achieve full rate through cooperative multiplexing. Under the assumption of perfect CSI, the proposed system is analyzed in terms of average BER for BPSK. A closed-form expression for the BER is obtained through series expansion and numerical integration. Hence, the obtained expression are found to be an accurate approximation for the BER.

Number of References: 6

(p151.0) The authors of [202] study a multiuser cooperative VLC-NOMA. The LED broadcasts the OOK modulated NOMA signal through non-fading channels to N users. The users perform SIC to detect the individual signals. Therefore, the nearest user has to detect the signals of all other users, while the farthest user detects only its own signal. The second round is composed of N−1 time slots during which each user forwards the detected signals of other users. The cooperation ensures the link reliability for the far-users. Furthermore, the far-users use MRC and SIC to detect their desired signals. The exact BER of the proposed model is derived under the assumptions of perfect CSI and imperfect SIC.

(p151.1) In [42], the BER of an optical backhauled three-hop cooperative NOMA is derived. The first hop is from the source to the first relay, which is realized using FSO. The second hop between the first and second relay is realized using RF, and finally, the third hop to the end-user is performed using VLC. The RF node acts as an AF relay and the VLC node acts as a DF relay. The adopted system model and performance analysis consider various impairments such as fading caused by the atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, pathloss, photodiode responsitivity, and AWGN. The BER is evaluated only for a two-user NOMA using BPSK modulation.

During the first time slot, the BS transmits the IM-OFDM information in a NOMA fashion to both users. The near-user performs SIC to detect its signal, while the faruser retains the received signal till the next slot. During the second time slot, the near-user acts as a relay and forwards the far-users signal. The far-user uses MRC-MLD to combine the signals received in the two time slots and detect its desired signal. Tight closed-form upper bound BER expressions are derived for both users over Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, Chen et al.

Assuming the far-user symbols embedded in the indices of the activated subcarriers as well as the NOMA signal, the far-user performs JMLD to jointly detect its data from the OFDM signal and the indices of the active subcarrier. The near-user on the other hand performs SIC to detect its own signal. Furthermore, the authors of [215] consider N users in UL with SIMO settings. Assuming a single active subcarrier, closed-form PEP expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels considering JMLD for all users.

Therefore, to alleviate the adverse effects of collisions, the users are multiplexed through IM-OFDM. To obtain the frequency-domain signal for the delay-sensitive user, a portion of the bits are mapped to the standard constellation, which is then transmitted to the BS via a Rayleigh fading channel. To improve the delay-sensitive user's SNR, the NOMA signals received over multiple transmissions are combined and detected using MRC-MLD. The BER and SINR of the delay-sensitive user is analyzed. The probability of a subcarrier being active or inactive is taken into account when computing the average BER, which is derived in closed-form for BPSK and M n -QAM modulations. On the other hand, Shahab et al. [217] propose an IM-IM-single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA)-NOMA system to support massive machine type communication (mMTC).

As a result, the transmitter conveys log 2 (number of power levels) additional bits alongside the actual transmitted symbols. Since the users are unaware of the dynamically changing power levels, a distinct constellation is designed for each power level to distinguish between them. The error rate performance of the system is evaluated using conditional PEP analysis, with a Rayleigh fading channel and M n -PAM modulation.

(p155.0) According to Shannon capacity theorem, the probability of decoding error approaches zero when the block length approaches infinity [50]. Therefore, the error probability deteriorates by reducing the block length. This type of communications is referred to as SPC and is crucial for URLLC applications. Hence, the error probability associated with SPC cannot be ignored. SPC is investigated in the context of NOMA to highlight the throughput and the error rate performance. Table 19 provides a summary of the work in this part. State-of-the-Art on NOMA-based SPC: The average BLER is analyzed for the DL-NOMA with SPC in [50], [222], [223], [224], [225], [226], [230], [235]. It is obtained by considering a linear approximation of the instantaneous BLER, PDF and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of users. It is noted that the derived expressions are a function of SINR, block length, and target rate.

(p155.1) A two-user DL NOMA system employing SPC is studied in [50], [222]. The authors of [50] analyzed the users' error probabilities in AWGN channels for coded system, and uncoded system given that imperfect SIC is considered and QPSK is adopted. In both cases, a PA optimization problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the error probability. On the other hand, Reference [222] considered Rayleigh fading channels. It is demonstrated that the blocklength can be represented as the function of users' power coefficients. The authors formulate an optimization problem in which the objective is to minimize the blocklength under average BLER constraints. Consequently, a closed-form expression for average BLER is derived to solve the optimization problem and to determine the best minimum blocklength for each user.

(p155.2) A multiuser DL-NOMA with SPC is investigated in [223] considering Nakagami-m fading channels. The authors derived analytical expressions for the average BLER considering perfect SIC. The expressions are obtained by utilizing the conditional BLER and the PDF. A linear function is used to approximate the complex integration required for the derivation. The CDF is constructed using the derived average BLER.

(p155.3) Yuan et al. [224] study the BLER performance of a DL-NOMA system considering SPC with Alamouti space-time block code. The BS is equipped with two antennas, while the two users have single antenna. Nakagami-m fading channel is assumed, where the channel remains constant across a twosymbol period. The instantaneous BLER is approximated and the CDF of the SINR under imperfect SIC assumption is derived. Closed-form BLER expressions are derived for both users using the instantaneous BLER and the corresponding CDFs. Furthermore, asymptotic expressions for the average BLER are derived to obtain the expressions for the minimum blocklengths for both users.

(p155.4) A secure two-user DL-NOMA with SPC is investigated in [225]. It is assumed that the far-user can eavesdrop on the signal transmitted to the near-user. While assuming imperfect SIC, and perfect CSI knowledge at all ends, the average secure BLER of the near-user for detecting and decoding its signal is derived over Rayleigh fading channels. Finally, an asymptotic average secure BLER is derived for the near-user via linear approximations. In [226], a hybrid long and short packet communication DL-NOMA is proposed, in which the near-user requests a long packet while the far-user requests a short packet. The analytical expression of the average BLER for the far-user is derived over Rayleigh fading channel considering linear approximations to simplify the analysis.

(p155.5) The performance of a two-user UL-NOMA system is presented in [228]. All nodes are equipped with a single antenna. A unified analysis is conducted for SPC for various fading channels, including lognormal-Nakagami-m, generalized K G , η − μ, Nakagami-q (Hoyt), κ − μ, Rician, Nakagami-m, and Rayleigh fading. While assuming imperfect CSI at the users, closed-form BLER expressions are derived. In [227], the authors analyze the performance of an N-user UL-NOMA system with SPC under the influence of channel estimation errors and RHI. The users are divided into several clusters, each consisting of a fixed number of users. The article proposes two decoding schemes: 1) fixed-order decoding, where the decoding order is determined based on the power levels, 2) dynamic decoding order, where the decoding order is determined by the instantaneous received powers. Closed-form BLER expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p155.6) The authors of [229] study the performance of a two-user UL-NOMA with hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) using SPC. Upon reception of negative acknowledgement by both users from the BS, the proposed scheme allows the higher power user to retransmit up to L times, while the lower power user transmits a new packet. The lower power user is allowed to retransmit only when the higher power user stops retransmission. The closed-form expressions for BLER are obtained for Rayleigh fading channels by employing a Markov model, assuming ideal CSI knowledge at all nodes, and utilizing MRC as well as imperfect SIC.

(p155.7) State-of-the-Art on SPC with CRS-NOMA: The authors of [230] study SPC for a two-user DL cooperative NOMA with user relaying. During the first time slot, the BS transmits a NOMA signal to both users. During the second time slot, the near-user acts as a HD-DF relay for the far-user after detecting the signals using SIC. The far-user combines the two received realizations during the two slots and combines them using SeC and MRC. The authors derive closed-form expressions for the BLER over Rayleigh fading channels considering linear approximation. In addition, an asymptotic BLER is computed for long packets.

(p155.8) Another SPC with DL-NOMA is discussed in [231]. The model consists of one source node, two NOMA users, and one selective DF-HD relay, where all nodes are equipped with a single antenna. While assuming perfect CSI at all nodes, the BLER is derived under Rayleigh fading channels and imperfect SIC conditions. Furthermore, separate analyses are performed at the far-user for SeC and MRC. In [232], an analytical framework for SPC with CRS-DL-NOMA over Nakagami-m fading channels is presented. The system consists of a source node, two NOMA users, and multiple DF-HD relays, each with a single antenna. The transmission is split into two time slots. During the first time slot, the transmitter broadcasts a NOMA signal to both users. If the far-user signal is successfully decoded by the near-user, it then implements SIC to obtain its signal; otherwise, the entire received NOMA sequence is cached. At the same time, the relays directly decode the received NOMA sequence to obtain the far-user signal. If failed to decode the far-user's signal, the relay is selected for transmission in the second time slot based on the resultant SINR at the relays and received SNR at the far-user. Otherwise, the relay is chosen based on the distance between the relays and the near-user, as well as the distance between the transmitter and the near-user. The goal of relay selection is to improve the near-user's reliability. The average BLER expressions are derived for the users under perfect and imperfect SIC assumptions.

(p155.9) Furthermore, DL-NOMA assisted SPC system is proposed in [233]. The system consists of a source and two NOMA users, with the near-user acting as a DF-FD relay and thus experiencing RSI. The fading channels between the nodes follow the Rayleigh distribution. The model assumes perfect SIC and perfect CSI conditions. There are two types of RSI models considered. One in which the RSI link is assumed to be free of fading and the other in which the RSI link follows Rayleigh fading. The expressions for average BLER are derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.

(p155.10) The authors of [234] present a novel approach, which involves a partial DF-AF relaying technique for a two-user UL-NOMA with SPC. In the first time slot, both users transmit their signals to the relay. The relay then employs partial SIC to decode the signal with higher receive power and re-encodes this within the received signal employing a modified PA. During the second time slot, the relay transmits this new NOMA signal to the BS. The BS then utilizes MRC and SIC to successfully decode the signals of the users. Upon a comparative analysis with the conventional DF, it is observed that the proposed technique is distinguished by its reduced complexity and enhanced security. Assuming that both the relay and the BS have multiple antennas, the authors derive closed-form BLER expressions over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p155.11) State-of-the-Art on SPC with CR-NOMA: In [235], a DL wireless-powered CR-NOMA IoT network with SPC is presented. The system consists of a BS, a secondary source node, multiple primary users and two secondary NOMA users. The secondary source node uses the energy harvested from the BS to transmit information to the near-and far-user using NOMA. All nodes, excluding the BS, are assumed to be equipped with a single antenna and to be operating in HD mode. The secondary source node adjusts its transmission power to avoid interfering with the primary users and meet their QoS requirements. The proposed system operates in two phases. The first phase involves the EH, while the second phase is the information transmission to the secondary users using NOMA. The authors derive approximate and asymptotic average BLER expressions. To obtain these expressions, the CDF is derived by using a linear approximation of the instantaneous BLER expression in order to deal with the complex Q-function. In addition, the concept of first order Riemann integral approximation is used to handle the multiple integration involved in the CDF. Finally, the simulation results are compared to the analytical solution and to the real-time configuration results obtained using the deep neural network technique.

(p155.12) The authors of [236] study the performance of an CR-NOMA with SPC. The system consists of a primary network with a primary user and a secondary network with secondary users. In an underlay fashion, the secondary network uses NOMA for broadcasting to the secondary users with a tolerable interference at the primary user. Assuming perfect CSI, closed-form BLER expressions are derived for the imperfect SIC over Nakagami-m fading channels. On the other hand, the authors of [237] consider the effect of imperfect CSI and analyze the BLER.

(p155.13) State-of-the-Art on SPC with VLC-NOMA: A theoretical framework is proposed in [238] to assess the efficiency of SPC in a DL-VLC system employing NOMA. It is assumed that perfect CSI is known to the transmitter and the users. In this system, a single transmitting LED establishes communication over VLC channel with two single-photodiode users. Under the assumption of imperfect SIC and perfect CSI, closed-form expressions for BLER are derived. Furthermore, the performance of the same system under the assumption of imperfect CSI knowledge is studied in [239].

(p155.14) State-of-the-Art on SPC with IRS-aided NOMA: Vu et al. [240] study the STAR-IRS-enabled NOMA with SPC. Assuming perfect knowledge of CSI and perfect SIC, approximate and asymptotic closed-form BLER expressions are derived for the discrete phase shift model over Rayleigh fading channels, where the direct link between the two users and BS is assumed absent. Furthermore, Vu et al. extend the work to multiple users in [241]. The authors of [242] consider the two-user scenario with imperfect SIC and derive closed-form BLER expressions for the continuous phase model over Nakagami-m fading channels, where the direct link between the BS and one of the users only is assumed available. Similarly, the authors of [243] consider a two-user model but with perfect SIC and statistical CSI knowledge. The authors derive closed-form BLER expressions for the continuous and discrete phase models over Rician fading channels, where the direct link between the users and BS is assumed absent. Yuan et al. [244] consider an IRS-aided NOMA with SPC.

(p159.0) As discussed in Section II, IRS can enhance the system performance by controlling the propagation of signals in the environment via passive smart metasurface elements. However, there are several challenges, such as acquiring channel estimates between all metasurface elements and users. Since the IRS is passive, it cannot transmit pilot/training signals to facilitate channel estimation. Hence, novel channel estimation methods should be considered for IRS, such as estimating the cascaded user-IRS-BS channels, or by considering semi-passive IRS models which have sensing capabilities [252]. Also, the phase cannot be controlled continuously in practice. Therefore, it is crucial to consider quantized phase control.

Moreover, the design and analysis for the UL direction is a promising direction as well. Furthermore, studying the system performance while considering the direct link between the users and the BS is still an open research question. Hence, the design and analysis of the dual function IRS in DL and UL-NOMA systems is attractive.

(p161.0) Higher frequency bands such as mmWave bands are currently used in the 5G standard to satisfy the growth in higher data requirements, since wider bandwidths are available at such frequencies. However, current trends indicate that THz bands, which are wider than millimeter bands, are considered a key technology for future wireless networks [25]. Nonetheless, the propagation limitations become more challenging and the communications would be directional and take place mostly in LoS environments. Therefore, the nearfar problem would exist even if the users are relatively in close proximity. Consequently, studying the best conditions for pairing the NOMA users under certain error rate performance requirements can provide a better understanding of the practical scenarios in which NOMA performance would be maximized. Furthermore, including technologies such as cooperative communications and IRS can be used to improve the network coverage.

In addition, problems including frame synchronization, time synchronization and carrier synchronization over the performance of NOMA systems are missing from the literature. Furthermore, the works of OFDM-NOMA systems reported in this survey mostly assume ideal conditions in terms of time and frequency synchronization, as well as cyclic prefix (CP) length which is assumed to be longer than the channel maximum delay spread, and hence the inter-symbol interference is removed perfectly. However, such ideal conditions cannot be achieved in practical scenarios, where imperfect time and frequency synchronization are likely to occur. Additionally, OFDM-NOMA is prone to user mobility, which introduces Doppler shift and loss of subcarriers orthogonality.

(p208.0) IRS and backscatter communications can be considered key solutions for enhancing the spectrum and energy efficiencies of future wireless communications systems [38], [39]. The main principle of both technologies is based on reflecting the incident signals towards an intended destination. While IRS aims at improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination, backscatter communications aim at reflecting radio frequency (RF) signals to a passive or low-power backscatter communications device. IRS consists of passive metasurface elements that control the reflection angle of the incident signals, whereas backscatter communications devices consist of an antenna and an energy harvesting (EH) circuit with or without a dedicated power source to support the communications and sensory systems. Combining NOMA with IRS or backscatter communications can improve the coverage and energy efficiency of the system by facilitating the delivery of several coherent copies of the signal to the receiver. Furthermore, an IRS-assisted NOMA system with multiple transmit antennas enable channel manipulation to achieve the capacity region [40]. Therefore, NOMA combined with IRS or backscatter communications are considered energy, spectrum and cost-efficient solution for future wireless networks.

(p209.0) The evolution of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors have made it possible to use light sources for communications [41], [42]. Unlike optical fiber communications, VLC and free space optical (FSO) communications are performed wirelessly, where the former is mostly used for indoor mobile user applications, while the latter is used for outdoor applications such as backhauling for fixed pointto-point communications [43]. The frequency band for the VLC is 430 THz to 790 THz which corresponds to the unlicensed visible light spectrum, while the band for FSO includes infrared and ultraviolet. Such a wide free spectrum can provide a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity problem. Nonetheless, the main limitation of VLC and FSO systems is that the achievable data rates are constrained by the modulation bandwidth of the LEDs which spans a few hundred megahertz, hence can only utilize a small fraction of the available bandwidth at such frequencies [44]. It is worth noting that NOMA is particularly suitable for DL-VLC systems that aim at connecting a few users in a small cell, which is aligned with the principle of NOMA and small cell densification.

(p210.0) Utilizing some devices to relay the signals of other ones is an effective solution to extend the network range and overcome channel impairments such as fading, pathloss and shadowing. There are two main categories of such a solution, which are user relaying and dedicated relaying [45]. In the former, idle users act as relays, while in the latter category, dedicated relay nodes are distributed in the network. In general, two time slots are needed to relay the signal to the destination when half-duplex (HD) mode is considered, whereas one time slot is needed by the full-duplex (FD) mode. It is worth noting that high complexity and self-interference are the two main limitations for the FD mode. A simple network structure for dedicated user relaying in NOMA is that the near-user acts as a HD relay for the far-user either through decode-and-forward (DF) or amplify-and-forward (AF). In AF, a scaled version of the received signal is sent to the destination, while an attempt to detect the signal is made, then retransmission of the detected information takes place for DF. Various such network structures are discussed in [45].

However, to get the average performance, then N-fold integration should be considered because N channel realizations affect the received signal at the BS. This makes the analysis challenging, therefore, different approaches are introduced to solve this issue.

Number of References: 54

(p217.0) The PA scheme affects the error rate performance, and hence, it is a crucial aspect to discuss. Generally speaking, there are two main PA schemes, which are fixed PA and adaptive PA. The former ensures minimum signaling overhead and low complexity owing to its non-optimality, whereas the latter can ensure optimality or sub-optimality but with higher signaling overhead and complexity [34]. A number of issues should be considered when designing both schemes. First, ambiguity at the receivers. For example, ambiguity can be caused at the receivers for two NOMA users with binary phase shift keying (BPSK) if equal power coefficients are given when x 1 = −x 2 . Hence, two NOMA symbols will coincide on the same constellation point.

(p217.1) Moreover, enabling reliable detection using SIC requires abiding by certain power coefficient bounds (PCBs) [34], [47], [56], [57], [58]. Considering the previous example, when α 1 < α 2 the order of the NOMA symbols is as follows from the negative in-phase axis: 11, 01, 10, 00. In such a scenario, MLD can detect b 2 reliably because b 2 = 0 is always in the positive side. Hence, SIC can cancel the interference caused by b 2 and detect b 1 reliably. In contrast, when α 1 > α 2 , the two middle symbols swap order causing b 2 = 0 to fall in two different regions. Therefore, MLD will not be able to detect b 2 correctly, and hence the SIC performance will be unreliable. It is worth noting that this problem is not encountered when JMLD is used.

(p218.0) User pairing is the scheduler's process of selecting a set of users to share the same communication resource. In a DL/UL coordinated scenario, the BS acts as a centralized unit to coordinate the user pairing process to achieve a certain objective. For example, the objective could be the sum rate maximization while satisfying certain quality of service (QoS) constraints such as minimum rate per user or maximum BER per user. Also, user pairing can aim to ensure fairness among users. Furthermore, the satisfaction of such objectives and constraints depends on the network knowledge available at the scheduler. For instance, user pairing can satisfy certain criteria instantaneously if the CSI knowledge of all links is available instantaneously. Alternatively, such criteria can be satisfied on average if statistical CSI knowledge is available. For instance, it is reported that pairing users with the most distinct channel gains would maximize the sum rate in NOMA systems. The concept of prioritizing users with different priorities is known as cognitive radio (CR)-NOMA in which the primary user is given the highest priority while the secondary user is served opportunistically. Moreover, CR-NOMA tends to pair the best channel user with the second best channel user [59]. On the other hand, the UL decentralized scenario usually refers to the grant free access (GFA) in which the users are allowed random access to the channel without resource allocation. Hence, collisions might occur where the BS needs to detect collisions and resolve them in order to detect the messages.

On the other hand, the UL decentralized scenario usually refers to the grant free access (GFA) in which the users are allowed random access to the channel without resource allocation. Hence, collisions might occur where the BS needs to detect collisions and resolve them in order to detect the messages.

(p224.0) Synchronous UL-NOMA is studied while considering the two-user scenario [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90] and arbitrary number of users [36], [91]. In [84], [85], [86], closed-form BER expressions are derived for SISO setup over AWGN channels, where imperfect SIC is assumed. For example, both users use QPSK in [84], [85], whereas QPSK and BPSK are assigned to the near and far-users to account for channel asymmetry in [86]. Furthermore, accurate BER expressions over fading channels are derived for JMLD in [87], [88], where [87] considers SISO Rician channel and BPSK, while [88] considers single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) Rayleigh fading channel and QPSK.

(p224.1) Liu and Beaulieu [89] derive closed-form union bounds on the SER and BER of the two-user NOMA with QPSK for arbitrary relative phase offset in AWGN channel. These expressions are valid for both UL and DL, where intentional phase rotation can be applied for the former, and the channel can add phase rotation in the UL. Additionally, exact single-integral-from of the SER and BER expressions are derived for a specific power ratio. The authors of [90] study a multicarrier under-lay CR-NOMA system in the UL. By employing perfect SIC at the receiver, analytical expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels for the SER per sub-carrier of both the primary and secondary users with QPSK. Furthermore, closed-form approximations for these expressions are provided.

A comprehensive performance analysis of an UL-NOMA with adaptive M n -QAM in the presence of Rayleigh fading channels is proposed in [91]. The system consists of N users, each equipped with a single antenna, transmitting data to a BS with multiple receiving antennas. The BS employs maximal ratio combining (MRC) to combine the received signals from all antennas and JMLD for jointly estimating the symbols of each user. The system's performance is evaluated in terms of PEP. The utilization of MRC-JMLD effectively eliminates the error floor.

Unlike single carrier systems [96], maximizing the sum-rate in multicarrier systems is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problem that requires highly complex exhaustive search [92], [93]. Therefore, it is important to design efficient algorithms. Cejudo et al. [92] design an efficient resource allocation algorithm to maximize the sum-rate while satisfying the BER constraints. Accurate instantaneous BER expressions are presented for square M n -QAM considering imperfect SIC. These expressions are used to derive the exact optimal channel gain ratios between a pair of NOMA users, maximizing the achievable sum-rate for a given BER constrain. To ensure reliable SIC detection, the power coefficient for equally-spaced constellation points or highly separable constellation points groups is presented in closed-form. The exact optimal channel gain ratios and the approximated BER expressions over Rayleigh flat fading channel are used to design an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm which involves user pairing algorithm and continuous power and rate allocation.

(p227.0) References [49], [50], [98], [99] formulate several optimization problems to minimize the error performance of DL-NOMA systems. For example, the objective function in [49] is to minimize the instantaneous SER of the strong user while satisfying the SER requirement for the weak user. The instantaneous SER is derived in closed-form for both users considering M n -QAM and M n -PAM. Nonetheless, a closed-form suboptimal PA is derived. The authors of [50] propose a line search algorithm for a two-user system to find the optimal power coefficients that minimize the un/coded NOMA system overall error performance in AWGN channels. BER is considered and derived for the uncoded QPSK, while the SPC BER approximation is considered for the coded system. The work is extended in [98] to consider square M n -QAM, where the BER is approximated using the SER expressions derived for AWGN channels. These expressions are used to find the optimal power coefficients that minimize the instantaneous overall system BER. The optimization problem is simplified by obtaining upper and lower bounds of the overall BER.

(p227.1) Dutta [99] approximates the closed-form BER expressions using the SER expressions that are derived for an arbitrary number of DL-NOMA users, considering arbitrary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and perfect SIC. These expressions have been used for power allocation optimization such that the average BER among all users is minimized while satisfying certain minimum rate requirements per user. Since the problem is non-convex, an upper bound approximation is used for the objective function to make it convex, while the concave rate is transformed to be convex. As the probability of error considers all the possible realizations of the input vector, it is computationally difficult to handle the objective function. Hence, a faster approach is developed to find the optimal power coefficients, which is based on splitting the data sets into subsets and running the optimization for all subsets in parallel.

(p229.0) The error rate performance of NOMA is highly impacted by the symbol-to-bit labeling strategy used, [102], [103], [104], [105], [106]. There are three main labeling strategies which are: 1) NOMA non-Gray labeling, 2) Joint Gray labeling, 3) Natural labeling. The NOMA non-Gray labeling results naturally from the SC process. An example is shown in Fig. 5a. On the other hand, the joint Gray labeling is simply performed such that the NOMA word becomes Gray coded. This is done before SC on each user stream of bits, b n , such that the stream of bits after joint Gray coding is
## (s231) State-of-the-Art on NOMA with Constellation Rotation:
Number of References: 45

(p231.0) The work in [107] studies constellation rotation for the DL scenario with two users each of which is using QPSK. Because deriving exact closed-form SER expressions is challenging due to the arrangement of the NOMA constellation points, upper bounds on the SER are presented based on the union bound of the PEPs. These expressions are used for rotation angles optimization which is performed using exhaustive search. Chang and Fukawa [108] derive the optimal rotation angles that minimize ED between the NOMA constellation points for the two-user case while considering identical QPSK and QPSK with 16-QAM. Furthermore, the work is extended to the three-user case using QPSK in [109], where the optimal phase rotation is found for two schemes which are: 1) rotation for the near-user. 2) rotation for the near-user and the composite of near and middle users. Reference [110] studies two users NOMA with QPSK and finds the rotation angle that minimizes the dominant PEP, which translates to maximizing the smallest ED. It is found that the optimal rotation angle depends on the ratio of the assigned power coefficients and phase differences between the channel coefficients for UL, while it only depends on the ratio of the assigned power coefficients for DL. The work is extended in [111] by jointly optimizing the power coefficients and rotation angles. In [112], the authors propose phase pre-distortion for UL VLC-NOMA system to improve the SER. Assuming that the phase difference between the channels of the two users is uniformly distributed, closed-form SER expressions are derived considering QPSK for both users and SIC at the receiver. The optimal rotation angle that minimizes the SER is found to be the one that ensures 0 • relative phase, i.e., angle that causes co-phasing. Closed-form optimal rotation angles were derived for single and multi-receiving antenna cases. The joint optimization problem reduces to a piece-wise convex optimization problem over its sub-domains, for which the global maximum solution is obtained in closed-form. The work in [113] proposes an algebraic rotation approach to design DL-NOMA for two users while achieving full diversity and improved BER performance. This improvement gained due to the special lattice partition scheme that ensures maximum minimum product distance. The upper bound of the minimum product distance is derived in closed-form for arbitrary power coefficients for the two dimensional lattice. The work is generalized in [114] for multi-dimensional lattices. It is worthy to mention that the design and analysis are applicable to the JMLD rather than SIC, which imposes high complexity at the receiver, but reduces the decoding delay. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional NOMA and the scheme proposed in [107] in fast and block fading channels.

(p231.1) Ye et al. [115] study a two-user multi-antenna UL-NOMA with SIC utilizing constellation rotation. Optimal rotation angles are found to maximize the mutual information (MI) where the signal is modeled as a Gaussian mixture model. The MI maximization problem has high computational complexity because it is a bivariate problem. Hence, it is transformed to an entropy maximization problem that involves only a single random variable. Efficient closed-form approximation is derived using variational approximation. Improved sum-rate and lower BER are obtained when compared to conventional NOMA. Constellation rotation with space-time line code (STLC) is considered in [55] for two-user UL-NOMA, where the BS is equipped with two receiving antennas and each user is equipped with a single antenna. The channel between each user and each receiving antenna at the BS is assumed to be quasi-static for two time slots and known to the user. Hence, spatial diversity can be obtained using STLC-encoding. Assuming that QPSK is used by both users and constellation rotation is applied to one user only, upper bound expressions for the average BER are derived for the JMLD using the union bound of the PEPs. Additionally, an approximation is derived for high SNRs using Taylor series.

(p231.2) The authors of [116] propose a novel scheme for the single antenna DL-NOMA based on coordinate interleaving for a general number of users, where M n -pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) constellation is rotated by π/4 rad counter clock-wise. Because the real and imaginary components of the π/4 M n -PAM constellation are equal, then coordinate interleaving for the two-user case results in

(p231.3) It is worth noting that x sc in its current form does not have a unity average power. In fact E[|x sc | 2 ] = 2. Therefore, it has to be normalized for a fair comparison with the conventional NOMA system. Additionally, this scheme eliminates the need for using SIC at the receiver for the two-user case, while it reduces the number of SIC operations by more than half when there is more than two users in the system. Furthermore, closed-form SER expressions are derived for the two-user, as well as the optimal power coefficients that achieve fairness. A DL-NOMA scheme for a cluster of four users is proposed in [117] by utilizing phase rotation to achieve a lower BER and higher sum rate. The optimal rotation angle is determined to maximize the minimum distance between symbols, thereby improving overall system performance. Furthermore, the optimal power allocation is determined by minimizing both the inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances in the NOMA signal. The proposed method reduces the overall complexity by eliminating the need for SIC between subgroup multiplexing. Exact BER and union bound on BER expressions are derived for all users using M n -PSK or M n -QAM in a Rayleigh fading channel.

(p231.4) In [118], a constellation rotation technique is proposed for an UL-NOMA based IoT network to enhance performance. It is assumed that perfect CSI is available to the transmitting nodes, where each transmitter is equipped with a single antenna and the access point employs two antennas. The upper bounds on the BER over Rayleigh fading channels are derived for the case with two transmitters and QPSK. Both dynamic and fixed constellation rotation scenarios are considered, and optimal rotation angles are determined for a given SNR to improve the BER.

(p232.0) Multiuser interference generally causes performance degradation for NOMA users. However, constructive interference may improve the performance as the desired signal power is boosted by the interference. On the other hand, destructive interference degrades the performance of NOMA. Therefore, the concept of interference alignment is to design the individual users' signals such that they add constructively. This can be achieved via phase rotation [127], [128], [129] or symbol scaling [130], [131]. A summary of the work on interference alignment is given in Table 9.

(p233.0) The work in [127] proposes a constellation rotation scheme for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-assisted NOMA to maximize the energy transmitted to the wireless information transfer (WIT) users and wireless power transfer (WPT) users, while satisfying acceptable SER performance for the WIT users. To minimize the signaling overhead associated with informing the WIT receivers about the optimal rotation angles, the constellation rotation is performed jointly over a block of symbols rather  than on a symbol-by-symbol basis. The optimal constellation rotation angles are derived for QPSK case assuming two NOMA WIT users and a single WPT user. The work is extended in [128] by considering a multi-carrier system, arbitrary modulation orders, and multi WIT and WPT users. A joint design of the energy interleaver and constellation rotation is proposed, where the energy interleaver is introduced to suppress the destructive interference of multiple symbols scheduled on each subcarrier. Furthermore, the receiver operations for WIT and WPT users as well as the signaling overhead are discussed thoroughly. An iterative algorithm is proposed for obtaining optimal the constellation rotation angles since the objective function is non-convex. Whereas a low-complexity greedy algorithm is proposed for the energy interleaver integer optimization. In [129], phase rotation is applied to the near-user to allow constructive interference with the far-user symbol. In addition, a nonredundunt precoding is applied to the near-user symbol to allow symbol extraction at the receiver. The authors propose a semi-blind detection scheme based on independent component analysis to detect the near-user symbols after rotation. Nonetheless, it requires 1-2 pilot symbols to remove ambiguities caused by the independent component analysis. The SER is derived in closed-form under Rayleigh fading for two users with QPSK assuming perfect ambiguity elimination. Additionally, an efficient power allocation algorithm that is based on statistical channel information is proposed to minimize the average asymptotic SER. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the scheme is studied and compared with other common benchmarks, such as [108], [111].

## (s235) D. CHANNEL CODING
Number of References: 27

(p235.0) Channel coding is a well-known approach to reduce the error probability of digital communications systems at the cost of higher complexity at the transmitter and the receiver. Thus, studying the complexity and error rate performance of NOMA-based channel coding transceivers is pivotal. Typical channel coding schemes include low-density parity-check (LDPC) [132], [133], Reed-Solomon codes [132], trellis coded modulation (TCM) [134], polar codes [135], turbo codes [136], and repetition codes [137]. A comprehensive summary for the NOMA work with channel coding is depicted in Table 10.

(p235.1) State-of-the-Art on NOMA with Channel Coding: The authors of [132] propose a novel linear receiver that exploits the constraints of the forward error correcting (FEC) codes to mitigate the SIC error propagation caused by the imperfect CSI at the receiver, where the channel frequency response is estimated by interpolating the responses of the pilot subcarriers. The novel receiver is applicable to symbol and codeword-level SIC. It is designed for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-user UL-NOMA based on the minimum output energy criterion that can handle moderate channel estimation errors, where the IUIs are separated from the desired signals by adopting a unique signature based on the FEC codes' constraints. The receiver optimization is formulated as a quadratic programming problem anchored with set of code constraints. Transmit diversity and capacityachieving LDPC codes are considered. To improve the performance further, an iterative receiver is designed to recover the Reed-Solomon coded data that is serially concatenated to an LDPC code. To verify the reliability of the proposed detector, an upper bound for the coded BER is derived based on the union bound of the PEPs. The authors of [133] propose probabilistic shaping combined with QAM for N UL-NOMA users in Rayleigh fading channels to improve the SER. Probabilistic shaping assigns the constellation points that have equidistance space different probabilities such that the source generates information symbols with non-uniform probabilities using a constant composition distribution matcher method. To maximize the ergodic constrained capacity, a multi-step optimization is performed to find the optimal probability mass function for each user, where the optimization order is the inverse of the SIC order. At the receiver, maximum a posterior (MAP)based codeword-level SIC is implemented with an order determined by the large-scale pathloss. Unlike the symbollevel SIC, the codeword-level SIC can ideally cancel the IUI caused by the previously decoded signals due to the powerful error correcting codes as well as the soft channel decoder. Whereas the rest IUIs are assumed to be Gaussian distributed.

(p236.0) In [138], wavelet transform pulse shaping is analyzed for the DL OFDM NOMA as it is more spectrally efficient than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pulse shaping which requires cyclic prefix. Closed-form BER expressions are derived for both pulse shaping schemes in AWGN channels based on the ED approach, where the presented analysis holds for two-user case with QPSK assuming ideal synchronization. The strong channel user applies SIC to detect its signal, whereas the weak channel user detects its signal assuming that the other user signal being in the noise floor. The effect of the AWGN on the received signal is studied after passing the AWGN components through the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) filter banks and getting their true variances. Since the high frequency components are discarded in the DWT filter banks, the channel effect on the received signal is reduced and the signal recovery is improved.

(p236.1) Maatouk et al. [139] propose combining orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA) for DL-NOMA. Unlike conventional NOMA which for example combines two users and uses SIC to cancel the interference, the proposed scheme combines two groups of users with two sets of orthogonal waveforms and uses iterative SIC to cancel the interference between the groups. The users in the OFDMA group can detect their signal directly as the number of the users in the CDMA group is assumed to be small such that the interference is negligible. On the other hand, the users of the CDMA group need to use iterative SIC to cancel the interference. Khansa et al. [140] extend the work by introducing a power split between the two groups that follows the conventional NOMA. Approximate BER expressions are derived for QPSK case in AWGN channel by assuming the interference being a Gaussian-like signal for the OFDMA group of users, while the number of possible sequence errors for the CDMA group is assumed to follow the binomial distribution.

(p238.0) Haci et al. [142] study the asynchronous UL-NOMA system as perfect synchronization is difficult to achieve for UL users distributed in geographically diverse and dynamic environments. They propose a novel triangular-SIC detector which uses multiple symbols from each interfering user in a triangular pattern to carry out interference cancellation, where iterative soft and hard decision detectors are studied for higher modulation orders. The BER performance analysis is presented in [143] for the three-user case in flat Rayleigh fading considering conventional SIC and the proposed SIC, where besides the receiver power ratios, the BER of the proposed SIC depends also on the iteration number and the time offset between users. It is assumed that the relative time offset between the users is uniformly distributed, and the residual interference is approximated to the Gaussian distribution.

(p238.1) Liu and Beaulieu [144] propose a novel time asynchronous SIC for the asynchronous UL-NOMA. The detector is based on the triangular-SIC introduced by [142], [143] where an optimal time-offset is selected to eliminate the IUI. The optimal time offset is found to be half the symbol duration for the QPSK case. It is worth mentioning that the proposed detector does not introduce signaling overhead nor higher complexity, however, it requires the received symbol timing. Exact BER expressions are derived over AWGN channel considering two-user case with QPSK and imperfect SIC, where no relative phase rotation is assumed between the users. Additionally, a simpler BER approximation is derived for the weak user by relaxing the correlation between the noise samples at the detector. Furthermore, Liu et al.

(p240.2) The authors of [148] propose a low-complexity threshold based detector to detect the signals of two NOMA users in the DL, where the BS is equipped with a single antenna while the users are equipped with multiple antennas and use M n -QAM with M n ∈ (4, 16). The exponential bound of the Q(·) function is used to derive the SER expressions for Rayleigh fading channels. Al-Dweik et al. [149] study phase-independent NOMA using unipolar amplitude shift keying (ASK) which allows amplitude-coherent detection. Considering two and multiuser systems in ordered SISO Rayleigh fading channels, closed-form BER expressions are derived for three types of detectors, namely JMLD, conventional SIC and improved SIC. The improved SIC cancels interference more effectively than conventional SIC and has identical performance to the JMLD but with lower complexity. Reference [150] introduces a modified SIC detector for an UL-NOMA system. The proposed modified detector incorporates adaptable decision regions and enhance the decoding performance. Exact closed-form SER expressions and approximations are derived for the three-user case over AWGN channels while considering a single antenna at all nodes and QPSK.

Huang et al. [151] attempt to characterize the SER by analytically deriving the SER expressions considering multiple LEDs, unipolar transmission and line-of-sight (LoS) optical channels that are corrupted by AWGN. The PDF of the optical channel is obtained using the change of variable method, while the SER derivation is simplified using convolution theory and subsection integral method. Marshoud et al.

(p243.2) The authors of [156] categorize the users in a cell based on their data rate requirements. Hence, they propose an adjustable bit-rate SC such that each user bit interval is multiple base intervals, where the base interval is the bit interval of the lowest bit rate. Unlike the conventional SIC, the sample-and-sum SIC is introduced to minimize the error propagation caused by the conventional SIC, where each user samples the SC signal at a certain sample rate. Then, these samples will be summed for decoding. Moreover, a modified fixed power allocation is proposed to provide some clear correlation between the effects of adjusting power coefficients and the BER performance. The authors derive closed-form BER expressions for the multiuser scenario with OOK. Furthermore, the authors of [157] propose using OOK for the low data rate user, while MPPM is assigned for the high data rate user. To overcome the error propagation, a SICfree detector is proposed, where the MPPM user uses soft decision detector, whereas the OOK user sums the detected samples and uses MLD to detect its signal. A closed-form SER expression is derived for the OOK user, while a singleintegral form SER expression is derived for the MPPM user. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation for the probability of the number of erroneously detected slots in one MPPM symbol is derived.

(p246.0) The authors of [172] study the performance of the UL bistatic backscatter communications-aided NOMA for IoT sensors. Two backscatter nodes are co-located near the carrier emitter assuming interference-free channels. The backscatter nodes operate in two modes, namely the EH mode and the active mode, in which performing intentional impedance mismatch at the antenna input, produces two reflection coefficients to modulate the carrier signal with BPSK. The Nakagami-m fading channel multiplexes the modulated BPSK symbols in the power domain using NOMA. The backscatter reader receives the NOMA symbol and performs SIC for detection. As the analysis of such a problem is challenging, closed-from BER expressions are derived by ignoring the phases of the channels between the backscatter nodes and the backscatter reader. Also, the channels are assumed to be ordered, however, order statistics are not used. Rather than considering double-integration with respect to the Nakagami-m fading coefficients, the sum and difference of the fading coefficients are approximated by another Nakagami-m random variables.

Once these symbols are detected using JMLD, PLNC performs exclusive OR operations and sends the PLNC symbols using DL-NOMA in the third time slot. Then the users in each cluster use SIC to detect the symbols. Upper bound BER expressions are derived for the end-to-end system using BPSK and exponential channel. It is worth mentioning that the ambient backscatter is located near the far cluster pair and is only used during the third time slot.

Number of References: 117

(p248.0) Kara and Kaya [174], [175], consider a diamond-shaped CRS based on NOMA, with two HD-DF relays and a single destination. It is assumed that one relay is located at a far distance from the source, while the other relay is located closer. The transmission is accomplished in two time slots. During the first time slot, the source transmits a NOMA symbol of two BPSK modulated signals to both relays. The far relay employs single-user MLD, whereas the near relay uses SIC. In the second time slot, both relays use the UL-NOMA concept to forward the detected information to the destination. Finally, the signal received from the near relay is detected by the destination, while the signal received from the far relay is detected using SIC. For both time slots, the authors derive the BER over a SISO Rayleigh fading channel. Moreover, Kara and Kaya [176] consider a two-user DL-CRS with a single HD-DF relay located closer to the near-user, where no direct link exists between the users and BS. In the first time slot, the PA is applied in a reversed order, i.e., the power allocated to the near-user is larger than the power allocated to the far-user. However, the PA in the second time slot follows the conventional approach. It is worth noting that the SIC decoding order depends on the PA. Exact closedform BER expression is derived for identical QPSK with imperfect CSI over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p248.1) Kara et al. [177] propose using NOMA for a single-user CRS to overcome the SER degradation inherent to HD mode. In the proposed model, the source multiplexes two consecutive symbols as a NOMA symbol, where the first symbol x 1 is treated as the near-user, and thus it is allocated less power than the second symbol x 2 , the NOMA symbol is then transmitted to a HD-DF relay and to the destination. During the first time slot, the destination detects only x 2 while treating x 1 to be in the noise floor. The relay detects x 1 using SIC and forwards it to the destination in the second time slot. Exact closed-form BER expression is derived for BPSK over Nakagami-m fading channels. Further, the authors propose a machine learning PA algorithm to minimize the BER.

(p248.2) The RHIs of a multiuser DL-NOMA CRS that consists of a single HD-AF relay is studied in [178]. The users are considered to be within close proximity of each other, and they do not have a direct link with the BS. Assuming imperfect SIC, PEP expressions are derived over ordered Rayleigh fading channels. In [179], a two-user DL-NOMA CRS with R HD-DF relays is investigated, with each user having a dedicated relay that is selected based on a max-min criterion. It is assumed that no direct link exists between the BS and users. The far-user, which is a high-priority user, applies MLD for detection, while the near-user, which is a delay-tolerant user, applies SIC for detection. The average BER expressions are derived for BPSK over Rayleigh fading channels. In [180], a two-user UL-NOMA CRS with a single HD-AF relay is studied, where both users are at the cell edge and no direct link exists with the BS. In the first time slot, both users transmit their signals to the relay using UL-NOMA. In the second time slot, the relay applies linear noise reduction to the NOMA signal, the signal is then amplified and transmitted to the BS, which uses SIC for detection. Approximate SER is derived analytically which is accurate at high SNRs.

(p248.3) In [181], a two-user DL cooperative NOMA is investigated. The users and the relay have a single antenna each. Moreover, the relay operates in HD mode. The BER expressions are derived assuming Rayleigh fading channels between the transmitter and receivers, with BPSK modulation, imperfect CSI, and imperfect SIC. Althunibat et al. [182] study a two-way relaying system that improves the spectral efficiency by allowing two users to exchange data bi-directionally through two intermediate HD-DF relays in a PLNC fashion. In particular, during the first time slot, each user sends its DL-NOMA intended to the two relays. Consequently, the signals received at the relays follow the UL-NOMA principle. Each relay performs JMLD to detect its signals from the two users and combine them following PLNC principle. During the second time slot, the relays send the PLNC signal to the users following the UL-NOMA principle. Finally, given that each user knows its transmitted signals, it can detect the other user's signal using JMLD. The authors derive closed-form BER expressions over Rayleigh fading channels. The authors of [183] study a DL-NOMA CRS for hybrid satellite-terrestrial communication. During the first time slot, the satellite transmits to a ground destination and a ground relay. During the second time slot, the ground DF relay simultaneously transmits to the ground destination and a cellular user using DL-NOMA. Assuming imperfect SIC and co-channel interference, the authors derive closed-form SER expressions over shadowed Rician fading channels.

(p248.4) The author of [184] analyzes a two-user DL-NOMA CRS with a HD-DF serving both users. While considering all links to be available and imperfect SIC, closed-form BER expressions are derived for the linear combiner over AWGN channels. Reference [185] considers a similar model to [184] but imperfect CSI is assumed. Both the exact and asymptotic closed-form BER expressions are derived for the Rayleigh fading channels.

(p248.5) Kara and Kaya [174], [175], consider a diamond-shaped CRS based on NOMA, with two HD-DF relays and a single destination.

Finally, the signal received from the near relay is detected by the destination, while the signal received from the far relay is detected using SIC. For both time slots, the authors derive the BER over a SISO Rayleigh fading channel.

In the first time slot, the PA is applied in a reversed order, i.e., the power allocated to the near-user is larger than the power allocated to the far-user. However, the PA in the second time slot follows the conventional approach. It is worth noting that the SIC decoding order depends on the PA.

(p248.7) The RHIs of a multiuser DL-NOMA CRS that consists of a single HD-AF relay is studied in [178]. The users are considered to be within close proximity of each other, and they do not have a direct link with the BS. Assuming imperfect SIC, PEP expressions are derived over ordered Rayleigh fading channels. In [179], a two-user DL-NOMA CRS with R HD-DF relays is investigated, with each user having a dedicated relay that is selected based on a max-min criterion. It is assumed that no direct link exists between the BS and users. The far-user, which is a high-priority user, applies MLD for detection, while the near-user, which is a delay-tolerant user, applies SIC for detection. The average BER expressions are derived for BPSK over Rayleigh fading channels. In [180], a two-user UL-NOMA CRS with a single HD-AF relay is studied, where both users are at the cell edge and no direct link exists with the BS. In the first time slot, both users transmit their signals to the relay using UL-NOMA. In the second time slot, the relay applies linear noise reduction to the NOMA signal, the signal is then amplified and transmitted to the BS, which uses SIC for detection. Approximate SER is derived analytically which is accurate at high SNRs.

(p248.8) In [181], a two-user DL cooperative NOMA is investigated. The users and the relay have a single antenna each. Moreover, the relay operates in HD mode. The BER expressions are derived assuming Rayleigh fading channels between the transmitter and receivers, with BPSK modulation, imperfect CSI, and imperfect SIC. Althunibat et al. [182] study a two-way relaying system that improves the spectral efficiency by allowing two users to exchange data bi-directionally through two intermediate HD-DF relays in a PLNC fashion. In particular, during the first time slot, each user sends its DL-NOMA intended to the two relays. Consequently, the signals received at the relays follow the UL-NOMA principle. Each relay performs JMLD to detect its signals from the two users and combine them following PLNC principle. During the second time slot, the relays send the PLNC signal to the users following the UL-NOMA principle. Finally, given that each user knows its transmitted signals, it can detect the other user's signal using JMLD. The authors derive closed-form BER expressions over Rayleigh fading channels. The authors of [183] study a DL-NOMA CRS for hybrid satellite-terrestrial communication. During the first time slot, the satellite transmits to a ground destination and a ground relay. During the second time slot, the ground DF relay simultaneously transmits to the ground destination and a cellular user using DL-NOMA. Assuming imperfect SIC and co-channel interference, the authors derive closed-form SER expressions over shadowed Rician fading channels.

(p248.9) The author of [184] analyzes a two-user DL-NOMA CRS with a HD-DF serving both users. While considering all links to be available and imperfect SIC, closed-form BER expressions are derived for the linear combiner over AWGN channels. Reference [185] considers a similar model to [184] but imperfect CSI is assumed. Both the exact and asymptotic closed-form BER expressions are derived for the Rayleigh fading channels.

(p248.10) Kara and Kaya [174], [175], consider a diamond-shaped CRS based on NOMA, with two HD-DF relays and a single destination. It is assumed that one relay is located at a far distance from the source, while the other relay is located closer. The transmission is accomplished in two time slots. During the first time slot, the source transmits a NOMA symbol of two BPSK modulated signals to both relays. The far relay employs single-user MLD, whereas the near relay uses SIC. In the second time slot, both relays use the UL-NOMA concept to forward the detected information to the destination. Finally, the signal received from the near relay is detected by the destination, while the signal received from the far relay is detected using SIC. For both time slots, the authors derive the BER over a SISO Rayleigh fading channel. Moreover, Kara and Kaya [176] consider a two-user DL-CRS with a single HD-DF relay located closer to the near-user, where no direct link exists between the users and BS. In the first time slot, the PA is applied in a reversed order, i.e., the power allocated to the near-user is larger than the power allocated to the far-user. However, the PA in the second time slot follows the conventional approach. It is worth noting that the SIC decoding order depends on the PA. Exact closedform BER expression is derived for identical QPSK with imperfect CSI over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p248.11) Kara et al. [177] propose using NOMA for a single-user CRS to overcome the SER degradation inherent to HD mode. In the proposed model, the source multiplexes two consecutive symbols as a NOMA symbol, where the first symbol x 1 is treated as the near-user, and thus it is allocated less power than the second symbol x 2 , the NOMA symbol is then transmitted to a HD-DF relay and to the destination. During the first time slot, the destination detects only x 2 while treating x 1 to be in the noise floor. The relay detects x 1 using SIC and forwards it to the destination in the second time slot. Exact closed-form BER expression is derived for BPSK over Nakagami-m fading channels. Further, the authors propose a machine learning PA algorithm to minimize the BER.

(p250.0) Similar to the system model in [186], [187], the authors of [192] consider the near-user to be a SWIPT-enabled relay for the far-user, where the link between the BS and far-user does not exist. The proposed model is shown in Fig. 12. The union bound on the PEPs over ordered Rayleigh fading channels is derived for the near-and faruser while taking the AF and DF relaying protocols into account. It is worth noting that the analytical results are validated only for BPSK. Moreover, the authors of [193] extend the work to N users, while assuming AF relay. Closed-form PEP expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels. In [194], a cooperative NOMA system with SWIPT-enabled relay is investigated. The system model generally follows the one in [177] except that the relay harvests energy from the received NOMA signal during the first phase. Closed-form average BER is derived for BPSK modulation. In addition, machine learning is used to optimize the power sharing-power allocation to minimize the BER. Khennoufa et al. [195] study a cooperative DL-NOMA with EH, where the DF relay harvests the energy from the RF transmitted from the BS. Closed-form BER expressions over Nakagami-m fading channels are derived for a hybrid EH, i.e., power-time splitting, and EH techniques including time-splitting and power-splitting.

(p250.1) A SISO cooperative DL-NOMA for N SWIPT-enabled HD-AF relays and N users is proposed in [196]. The relays harvest energy from the received NOMA signal for a certain time, whereas the residual time is used to amplify and transmit the signal to the users. The exact and approximate PEP expressions are derived for all users. In [197], the cooperative NOMA is investigated, where a single SWIPT-enabled relay from the total of R relays is selected during the broadcast phase for cooperation between the transmitter and N users.

(p251.0) In [198], an underlay CR scenario in a SISO cooperative DL-NOMA is presented. As shown in Fig. 13, the system under consideration is composed of a primary and secondary BSs, as well as one primary and N secondary users served by R AF relays. Transmission power constraints are enforced on the secondary BS and a single selected relay to maintain a tolerable level of interference to the primary network. Accurate PEP expressions are derived and used to evaluate the BER union bound. Üstünbaş and Aygölü [199] propose a cooperative NOMA-based CR butterfly network. The system comprises a primary and secondary transmitters and receivers, and a single relay. The primary transmitter and secondary receiver share a cell, whereas the secondary transmitter and primary receiver share a different cell. During the first time slot, the QPSK modulated symbols are received simultaneously by the relay and nearby receivers. The relay uses MLD to directly detect the secondary transmitter signal, whereas the primary transmitter signal is obtained through SIC. In the second time slot, the relay generates a NOMA symbol from the detected symbols and forwards it to both receivers. Both receivers recover their respective symbols using SIC and MLD. The authors analyzed the BER performance for both users using QPSK modulation and while assuming imperfect SIC.

Assuming there is no direct link between the BS and far-user, the communication is established through a single selected HD-AF relay from the R available ones. The NOMA signal is received by the relays and near-user, where the near-user detects its own signal using SIC. Meanwhile, the relay with the maximum SNR with respect to the far-user is selected for cooperation. In the next round, the selected relay forwards the far-user signal through controlled power to avoid interference with the near-user. Exact closed-form BER expression is derived over SISO Rayleigh fading channel for BPSK assuming perfect CSI at the relays. To preserve the near-user QoS, [201] proposes a cooperative spectrum sharing mechanism based on NOMA, where the secondary transmitter cooperates with the primary to achieve full rate through cooperative multiplexing. Under the assumption of perfect CSI, the proposed system is analyzed in terms of average BER for BPSK. A closed-form expression for the BER is obtained through series expansion and numerical integration. Hence, the obtained expression are found to be an accurate approximation for the BER.

## (s252) 5) VLC-BASED COOPERATIVE RELAYING SYSTEM
Number of References: 6

(p252.0) The authors of [202] study a multiuser cooperative VLC-NOMA. The LED broadcasts the OOK modulated NOMA signal through non-fading channels to N users. The users perform SIC to detect the individual signals. Therefore, the nearest user has to detect the signals of all other users, while the farthest user detects only its own signal. The second round is composed of N−1 time slots during which each user forwards the detected signals of other users. The cooperation ensures the link reliability for the far-users. Furthermore, the far-users use MRC and SIC to detect their desired signals. The exact BER of the proposed model is derived under the assumptions of perfect CSI and imperfect SIC.

(p252.1) In [42], the BER of an optical backhauled three-hop cooperative NOMA is derived. The first hop is from the source to the first relay, which is realized using FSO. The second hop between the first and second relay is realized using RF, and finally, the third hop to the end-user is performed using VLC. The RF node acts as an AF relay and the VLC node acts as a DF relay. The adopted system model and performance analysis consider various impairments such as fading caused by the atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, pathloss, photodiode responsitivity, and AWGN. The BER is evaluated only for a two-user NOMA using BPSK modulation.

(p255.0) State-of-the-Art NOMA-based IM-OFDM: Chen et al. [212] study a two-user cooperative NOMA-based IM-OFDM system. During the first time slot, the BS transmits the IM-OFDM information in a NOMA fashion to both users. The near-user performs SIC to detect its signal, while the faruser retains the received signal till the next slot. During the second time slot, the near-user acts as a relay and forwards the far-users signal. The far-user uses MRC-MLD to combine the signals received in the two time slots and detect its desired signal. Tight closed-form upper bound BER expressions are derived for both users over Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, Chen et al. [213] extend the work presented in [212] by proposing a low-complexity greedy detector, where they present tight closed-form upper bound BER expressions.

(p255.1) The authors of [214] derive the PEP of a DL two-user IM-OFDM-NOMA system over Rayleigh fading channels considering. Assuming the far-user symbols embedded in the indices of the activated subcarriers as well as the NOMA signal, the far-user performs JMLD to jointly detect its data from the OFDM signal and the indices of the active subcarrier. The near-user on the other hand performs SIC to detect its own signal. Furthermore, the authors of [215] consider N users in UL with SIMO settings. Assuming a single active subcarrier, closed-form PEP expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels considering JMLD for all users.

Therefore, to alleviate the adverse effects of collisions, the users are multiplexed through IM-OFDM. To obtain the frequency-domain signal for the delay-sensitive user, a portion of the bits are mapped to the standard constellation, which is then transmitted to the BS via a Rayleigh fading channel.

(p256.0) According to Shannon capacity theorem, the probability of decoding error approaches zero when the block length approaches infinity [50]. Therefore, the error probability deteriorates by reducing the block length. This type of communications is referred to as SPC and is crucial for URLLC applications. Hence, the error probability associated with SPC cannot be ignored. SPC is investigated in the context of NOMA to highlight the throughput and the error rate performance. Table 19 provides a summary of the work in this part. State-of-the-Art on NOMA-based SPC: The average BLER is analyzed for the DL-NOMA with SPC in [50], [222], [223], [224], [225], [226], [230], [235]. It is obtained by considering a linear approximation of the instantaneous BLER, PDF and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of users. It is noted that the derived expressions are a function of SINR, block length, and target rate.

(p256.1) A two-user DL NOMA system employing SPC is studied in [50], [222]. The authors of [50] analyzed the users' error probabilities in AWGN channels for coded system, and uncoded system given that imperfect SIC is considered and QPSK is adopted. In both cases, a PA optimization problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the error probability. On the other hand, Reference [222] considered Rayleigh fading channels. It is demonstrated that the blocklength can be represented as the function of users' power coefficients. The authors formulate an optimization problem in which the objective is to minimize the blocklength under average BLER constraints. Consequently, a closed-form expression for average BLER is derived to solve the optimization problem and to determine the best minimum blocklength for each user.

(p256.2) A multiuser DL-NOMA with SPC is investigated in [223] considering Nakagami-m fading channels. The authors derived analytical expressions for the average BLER considering perfect SIC. The expressions are obtained by utilizing the conditional BLER and the PDF. A linear function is used to approximate the complex integration required for the derivation. The CDF is constructed using the derived average BLER.

(p256.3) Yuan et al. [224] study the BLER performance of a DL-NOMA system considering SPC with Alamouti space-time block code. The BS is equipped with two antennas, while the two users have single antenna. Nakagami-m fading channel is assumed, where the channel remains constant across a twosymbol period. The instantaneous BLER is approximated and the CDF of the SINR under imperfect SIC assumption is derived. Closed-form BLER expressions are derived for both users using the instantaneous BLER and the corresponding CDFs. Furthermore, asymptotic expressions for the average BLER are derived to obtain the expressions for the minimum blocklengths for both users.

(p256.4) A secure two-user DL-NOMA with SPC is investigated in [225]. It is assumed that the far-user can eavesdrop on the signal transmitted to the near-user. While assuming imperfect SIC, and perfect CSI knowledge at all ends, the average secure BLER of the near-user for detecting and decoding its signal is derived over Rayleigh fading channels. Finally, an asymptotic average secure BLER is derived for the near-user via linear approximations. In [226], a hybrid long and short packet communication DL-NOMA is proposed, in which the near-user requests a long packet while the far-user requests a short packet. The analytical expression of the average BLER for the far-user is derived over Rayleigh fading channel considering linear approximations to simplify the analysis.

(p256.5) The performance of a two-user UL-NOMA system is presented in [228]. All nodes are equipped with a single antenna. A unified analysis is conducted for SPC for various fading channels, including lognormal-Nakagami-m, generalized K G , η − μ, Nakagami-q (Hoyt), κ − μ, Rician, Nakagami-m, and Rayleigh fading. While assuming imperfect CSI at the users, closed-form BLER expressions are derived. In [227], the authors analyze the performance of an N-user UL-NOMA system with SPC under the influence of channel estimation errors and RHI. The users are divided into several clusters, each consisting of a fixed number of users. The article proposes two decoding schemes: 1) fixed-order decoding, where the decoding order is determined based on the power levels, 2) dynamic decoding order, where the decoding order is determined by the instantaneous received powers. Closed-form BLER expressions are derived over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p256.6) The authors of [229] study the performance of a two-user UL-NOMA with hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) using SPC. Upon reception of negative acknowledgement by both users from the BS, the proposed scheme allows the higher power user to retransmit up to L times, while the lower power user transmits a new packet. The lower power user is allowed to retransmit only when the higher power user stops retransmission. The closed-form expressions for BLER are obtained for Rayleigh fading channels by employing a Markov model, assuming ideal CSI knowledge at all nodes, and utilizing MRC as well as imperfect SIC.

(p256.7) State-of-the-Art on SPC with CRS-NOMA: The authors of [230] study SPC for a two-user DL cooperative NOMA with user relaying. During the first time slot, the BS transmits a NOMA signal to both users. During the second time slot, the near-user acts as a HD-DF relay for the far-user after detecting the signals using SIC. The far-user combines the two received realizations during the two slots and combines them using SeC and MRC. The authors derive closed-form expressions for the BLER over Rayleigh fading channels considering linear approximation. In addition, an asymptotic BLER is computed for long packets.

(p256.8) Another SPC with DL-NOMA is discussed in [231]. The model consists of one source node, two NOMA users, and one selective DF-HD relay, where all nodes are equipped with a single antenna. While assuming perfect CSI at all nodes, the BLER is derived under Rayleigh fading channels and imperfect SIC conditions. Furthermore, separate analyses are performed at the far-user for SeC and MRC. In [232], an analytical framework for SPC with CRS-DL-NOMA over Nakagami-m fading channels is presented. The system consists of a source node, two NOMA users, and multiple DF-HD relays, each with a single antenna. The transmission is split into two time slots. During the first time slot, the transmitter broadcasts a NOMA signal to both users. If the far-user signal is successfully decoded by the near-user, it then implements SIC to obtain its signal; otherwise, the entire received NOMA sequence is cached. At the same time, the relays directly decode the received NOMA sequence to obtain the far-user signal. If failed to decode the far-user's signal, the relay is selected for transmission in the second time slot based on the resultant SINR at the relays and received SNR at the far-user. Otherwise, the relay is chosen based on the distance between the relays and the near-user, as well as the distance between the transmitter and the near-user. The goal of relay selection is to improve the near-user's reliability. The average BLER expressions are derived for the users under perfect and imperfect SIC assumptions.

(p256.9) Furthermore, DL-NOMA assisted SPC system is proposed in [233]. The system consists of a source and two NOMA users, with the near-user acting as a DF-FD relay and thus experiencing RSI. The fading channels between the nodes follow the Rayleigh distribution. The model assumes perfect SIC and perfect CSI conditions. There are two types of RSI models considered. One in which the RSI link is assumed to be free of fading and the other in which the RSI link follows Rayleigh fading. The expressions for average BLER are derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.

(p256.10) The authors of [234] present a novel approach, which involves a partial DF-AF relaying technique for a two-user UL-NOMA with SPC. In the first time slot, both users transmit their signals to the relay. The relay then employs partial SIC to decode the signal with higher receive power and re-encodes this within the received signal employing a modified PA. During the second time slot, the relay transmits this new NOMA signal to the BS. The BS then utilizes MRC and SIC to successfully decode the signals of the users. Upon a comparative analysis with the conventional DF, it is observed that the proposed technique is distinguished by its reduced complexity and enhanced security. Assuming that both the relay and the BS have multiple antennas, the authors derive closed-form BLER expressions over Rayleigh fading channels.

(p256.11) State-of-the-Art on SPC with CR-NOMA: In [235], a DL wireless-powered CR-NOMA IoT network with SPC is presented. The system consists of a BS, a secondary source node, multiple primary users and two secondary NOMA users. The secondary source node uses the energy harvested from the BS to transmit information to the near-and far-user using NOMA. All nodes, excluding the BS, are assumed to be equipped with a single antenna and to be operating in HD mode. The secondary source node adjusts its transmission power to avoid interfering with the primary users and meet their QoS requirements. The proposed system operates in two phases. The first phase involves the EH, while the second phase is the information transmission to the secondary users using NOMA. The authors derive approximate and asymptotic average BLER expressions. To obtain these expressions, the CDF is derived by using a linear approximation of the instantaneous BLER expression in order to deal with the complex Q-function. In addition, the concept of first order Riemann integral approximation is used to handle the multiple integration involved in the CDF. Finally, the simulation results are compared to the analytical solution and to the real-time configuration results obtained using the deep neural network technique.

(p256.12) The authors of [236] study the performance of an CR-NOMA with SPC. The system consists of a primary network with a primary user and a secondary network with secondary users. In an underlay fashion, the secondary network uses NOMA for broadcasting to the secondary users with a tolerable interference at the primary user. Assuming perfect CSI, closed-form BLER expressions are derived for the imperfect SIC over Nakagami-m fading channels. On the other hand, the authors of [237] consider the effect of imperfect CSI and analyze the BLER.

(p256.13) State-of-the-Art on SPC with VLC-NOMA: A theoretical framework is proposed in [238] to assess the efficiency of SPC in a DL-VLC system employing NOMA. It is assumed that perfect CSI is known to the transmitter and the users. In this system, a single transmitting LED establishes communication over VLC channel with two single-photodiode users. Under the assumption of imperfect SIC and perfect CSI, closed-form expressions for BLER are derived. Furthermore, the performance of the same system under the assumption of imperfect CSI knowledge is studied in [239].

(p256.14) State-of-the-Art on SPC with IRS-aided NOMA: Vu et al. [240] study the STAR-IRS-enabled NOMA with SPC. Assuming perfect knowledge of CSI and perfect SIC, approximate and asymptotic closed-form BLER expressions are derived for the discrete phase shift model over Rayleigh fading channels, where the direct link between the two users and BS is assumed absent. Furthermore, Vu et al. extend the work to multiple users in [241]. The authors of [242] consider the two-user scenario with imperfect SIC and derive closed-form BLER expressions for the continuous phase model over Nakagami-m fading channels, where the direct link between the BS and one of the users only is assumed available. Similarly, the authors of [243] consider a two-user model but with perfect SIC and statistical CSI knowledge. The authors derive closed-form BLER expressions for the continuous and discrete phase models over Rician fading channels, where the direct link between the users and BS is assumed absent. Yuan et al. [244] consider an IRS-aided NOMA with SPC.

(p260.0) As discussed in Section II, IRS can enhance the system performance by controlling the propagation of signals in the environment via passive smart metasurface elements. However, there are several challenges, such as acquiring channel estimates between all metasurface elements and users. Since the IRS is passive, it cannot transmit pilot/training signals to facilitate channel estimation. Hence, novel channel estimation methods should be considered for IRS, such as estimating the cascaded user-IRS-BS channels, or by considering semi-passive IRS models which have sensing capabilities [252]. Also, the phase cannot be controlled continuously in practice. Therefore, it is crucial to consider quantized phase control.

Moreover, the design and analysis for the UL direction is a promising direction as well. Furthermore, studying the system performance while considering the direct link between the users and the BS is still an open research question.

(p262.0) Higher frequency bands such as mmWave bands are currently used in the 5G standard to satisfy the growth in higher data requirements, since wider bandwidths are available at such frequencies. However, current trends indicate that THz bands, which are wider than millimeter bands, are considered a key technology for future wireless networks [25]. Nonetheless, the propagation limitations become more challenging and the communications would be directional and take place mostly in LoS environments. Therefore, the nearfar problem would exist even if the users are relatively in close proximity. Consequently, studying the best conditions for pairing the NOMA users under certain error rate performance requirements can provide a better understanding of the practical scenarios in which NOMA performance would be maximized. Furthermore, including technologies such as cooperative communications and IRS can be used to improve the network coverage.

(p264.0) Although several articles studied the impact of imperfect SIC and channel estimation errors as seen in Fig. 15, the literature works studying the impact of RHI, I/Q imbalance and phase noise are limited [125], [126], [178], [227]. In addition, problems including frame synchronization, time synchronization and carrier synchronization over the performance of NOMA systems are missing from the literature. Furthermore, the works of OFDM-NOMA systems reported in this survey mostly assume ideal conditions in terms of time and frequency synchronization, as well as cyclic prefix (CP) length which is assumed to be longer than the channel maximum delay spread, and hence the inter-symbol interference is removed perfectly. However, such ideal conditions cannot be achieved in practical scenarios, where imperfect time and frequency synchronization are likely to occur. Additionally, OFDM-NOMA is prone to user mobility, which introduces Doppler shift and loss of subcarriers orthogonality. Applying orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and studying the error rate performance of NOMA systems under the previously mentioned imperfections can be important directions for future research

However, such ideal conditions cannot be achieved in practical scenarios, where imperfect time and frequency synchronization are likely to occur. Additionally, OFDM-NOMA is prone to user mobility, which introduces Doppler shift and loss of subcarriers orthogonality. Applying orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and studying the error rate performance of NOMA systems under the previously mentioned imperfections can be important directions for future research

(p267.0) Nonorthogonal multiplexing (NOM) has been proposed for HARQ-based wireless systems to allow multiplexing new packet transmission with retransmissions such that the energy efficiency and latency are improved [257]. While [258] considers generalizing NOM to more than two packets, the PA is assumed fixed during the retransmissions. Allowing adaptive power and considering higher modulation orders can improve performance further. Nonetheless, the design of a low-complexity detector and low-complexity algorithm to solve the PA and the number of multiplexed packets are important research directions.
