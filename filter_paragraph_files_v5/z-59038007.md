(p3.0) This section highlights essential technologies that have the potentiality to shape the future of marketing. The first technology that future research needs to explore is the NFC (Near Field Communication) Technology. The NFC technology offers vast possibilities for brands to communicate with their consumers. Through wireless technology, NFC enables two devices that are close to each other to exchange bits of information (Dutot, 2015). NFC technology can assist consumers to connect to their bank account and communicate this information to the retailer to make a payment (Pham & Ho, 2015). The NFC technology can allow marketers identify users' personal preferences and shopping habits to develop faster and easier purchase experience during the customer journey.
