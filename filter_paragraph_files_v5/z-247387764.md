(p0.0) Fat tissue, like bone marrow, is derived from the mesenchyme and contains a stroma that is easily isolated, thus making it a potential source of regenerative cells [1,2]. It has been shown that the lipoaspirate is naturally a rich source of mesenchymal and stromal cells, exhibiting stable growth and kinetic proliferation in specific culture media [1,3]. When processed, these cells tend to concentrate in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which is the infranatant of the lipoaspirate [1]. When cultured in vitro, ASCs can differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic, myogenic, and chondrogenic lineages when subjected to specific lineage factors [1]. On the other hand, the non-cultured heterogeneous population of cells, known as stromal cells (SCs) or SVF cells, contain ASCs, hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells, endothelial cells, red blood cells (RBCs), fibroblasts, lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, pericytes, and other cell types [4].

(p0.1) In clinical practice, adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal cells are generally not administered alone but as a constituent of the SVF, a heterogeneous mixture of cells resulting from aspirated adipose tissue processing [1]. Notably, the adipose tissue SVF has become the focus of mesenchymal cell research, regenerative medicine, and fat grafting, with new processing equipment and methods being developed worldwide. Indeed, the engineering associated with SVF cells represents an exciting field of research for different diseases, including degenerative, congenital, or traumatic conditions and bone, joint, and soft tissue defects. These cells are primarily used in plastic surgery to supplement fat grafts, improving graft retention and long-term results [5][6][7].

(p10.0) In the study by Tang et al. (2019), the effect of monocytes/ macrophages on the osteogenic differentiation of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in three dimensional (3D) cocultures was evaluated [42]. The authors showed that monocytes and macrophage subtypes inhibit the osteogenic differentiation of ASCs in 3D PLGA/PCL structures. More specifically, the cocultured monocytes/macrophages decreased the expression of osteogenic markers such as ALP, BSP, and RUNX2. These results highlight the overlooked fact that inflammation can regulate osteoblasts from MSC-based bone constructs within the bone microenvironment. In this sense, the tight control of inflammation may be necessary to create an anabolic environment and improve cell-based bone construct performance.
