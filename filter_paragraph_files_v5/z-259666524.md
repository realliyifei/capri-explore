Number of References: 4

(p2.0) Tele-dentistry possibly has the potential to enhance availability of oral healthcare, improving the oral healthcare delivery, and to reduce costs related to dentistry by facilitating prompt diagnosis, well timed management of diseases and to reduce seclusion of healthcare providers by allowing regular peer-to-peer communications.Tele-dentistry can also reduce inequalities in availability of oral healthcare between urban and rural areas. [9]There are many barriers in providing access to a good quality of oral healthcare in the rural communities which includes the shortage of oral healthcare providers in these rural areas, a long travelling distance to reach the limited healthcare providers available and the scanty local resources. [10]Most of the rural communities do not have the financial and clinical resources needed to attract oral healthcare specialists.The patients who live in rural areas when referred to dental healthcare specialists (mostly in urban settings), have to travel long distances to reach them, which more often than not is expensive as well as time-consuming.

(p2.1) Tele-dentistry has the potential to bridge this gap as it allows the oral healthcare providers of rural areas to take advice from urban dental specialists. [10]Currently, most of the tele-dentistry programs have their primary focus on distance management in administering oral healthcare in rural institutions, continuing dental education and learning programs and providing referral services after thorough teleconsultations.Tele-dentistry is still not used as a direct program for providing oral healthcare. [11]In order to allow such a widespread implementation of these tele-dentistry initiatives political support, in addition to implementation of appropriate health policies and strategies is a must.
