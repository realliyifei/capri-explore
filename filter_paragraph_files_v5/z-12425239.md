(p0.0) In the past 30 years or so, there has been a gradual increase in the use of monoliths as catalyst supports. During this period, monoliths have mostly been used in environmental applications where high gas throughput and low pressure drop are required [1]. Some of the applications in which these benefits have proven useful include exhaust gas treatment [2,3], selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x [4], destruction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [5] and catalytic combustion [6]. More recently, there has been renewed interest in the use of monoliths for reactions where energy efficiency and cost reduction are required. In particular, these include catalytic combustion for power generation, the selective oxidation of alkanes and preferential oxidation (PrOx) of CO. In order for researchers to be able to improve on these reactions, an overall knowledge and understanding of the preparation of monolithic catalysts would be required.

(p0.1) There are several key reviews on the preparation of monoliths [1,[7][8][9]. In addition, there are some informative reviews on coating monolith structures [10][11][12]. Also crucial to the preparation of monolithic catalysts can be transport phenomena [13]. However, a summary of the existing literature on the basics, reasoning and understanding behind the preparation techniques of monoliths and coating techniques may better prepare researchers for the application of monoliths, especially as applied to oxidation catalysis.

(p2.0) Monolithic structures pose an attractive alternative to conventionally prepared catalyst pellets or powders due to a number of superior properties. Monoliths can offer better mass transfer, a low pressure drop, thermal stability and good mechanical strength over conventional catalyst pellets or powders [7,12,14]. Monoliths are essentially uniform blocks, consisting of parallel channels that can be extruded into different shapes and sizes. These structured supports are primarily sold in ceramic or metallic forms [14]. Monolithic structures can also be extruded from other materials, such as zeolites (Section 2.3.3) or carbon (Section 2.3.4). Major manufacturers of ceramic and metallic monoliths are Corning and Johnson Matthey, amongst others [14].

(p3.0) Monoliths are commonly manufactured as ceramic or metallic structures. Ceramic and metallic monoliths differ greatly in physical and chemical properties, with respective advantages and disadvantages. Ceramic monoliths have advantages over metallic monoliths with properties such as better porosity, hence good coating adherence, and thermal stability, whilst metallic monoliths offer advantages with respect to better heat transfer, pressure drop, mechanical stability, wall thickness and overall volume [14]. Ceramic monoliths have good thermal stability due to a low thermal expansion coefficient, however, can still crack with significant changes in temperature [5,12,35]. Metallic monoliths, though, are becoming popular despite the difficulty of catalyst adherence. Ceramic and metallic structures are most popular in monolith research literature currently, therefore, the following sections discuss the preparation of these structures, along with their relevance to some applications. 
## (s9) Sol-Gel

(p9.0) A sol refers to the dispersed form of a colloidal solution, and gelating occurs when an interlinked network is formed between colloidal particles, therefore, sol-gel is a dispersed form of the interlinked particles [102]. The sol-gel method used for coating monoliths involves preparing a sol, then coating the monolith and lastly calcining, which results in a γ-alumina layer. The outcome is better pore filling of the monolith as compared to conventional colloidal coating [12]. Sols can be prepared via a hydrolytic route or non-hydrolytic route as shown in Equations (5) and (6) [67].

(p9.1) where M = metal, for example aluminium. Equation (5) shows the hydrolysis reaction of the metal alkoxide using a suitable acid or base and water [67]. During the sol preparation with heat treatment and time, condensation occurs as shown in Equation (6) [103]. A more detailed description of the sol-gel process is provided by Schmidt [103]. Furthermore, Xiaoding et al. reported a study of sol-gel coating of monoliths via three types of aluminium sols, namely pseudoboehmite with urea and nitric acid, hydrolysis of aluminium chloride and aluminium powder, and hydrolysis of tri-sec-butoxide aluminium [10]. It was concluded that sols prepared via pseudoboehmite with urea and nitric acid and hydrolysis of tri-sec-butoxide are most suitable for sol-gel alumina coating of monoliths [10]. A typical sol-gel method of coating involves dipping the monolith in a sol from pseudoboehmite, urea and 0.3 M nitric acid in a weight ratio of 2:1:5, followed by emptying the channels, drying and finally calcination [104]. Sol-gel coating may be advantageous over conventional colloidal coating of monoliths, due to a strong adherence to the monolith, as the alumina layer forms on the surface of the channels. For slurry coating, a monolith, an γ-alumina suspension is prepared with larger particles, preferably between 2 and 5 µm, compared to the pore filling technique [96]. The general procedure involves the use of an acid to disperse alumina, after which the monolith is dipped in the slurry and excess liquid is removed by blowing compressed air through the channels, followed by drying and calcination or direct calcination [94,105]. Wet milling of the gamma-alumina to attain a required particle size is very important, as factors such as pH and viscosity play a key role in adhesion to the monolith surface [105]. The particles inside a typical stirred mill are highly influenced by stress energy, number of stress events and specific energy [106]. Milling can be a tedious process to attain the required particle size; however, γ-alumina is available commercially with an average particle size less than 5 µm. Nitric acid is suggested to be a most effective acid for slurry coating, as it helps to stabilize the slurry and allows for better alumina uptake [107]. The percentage of solids in the slurry also plays an important role in the efficacy and homogeneity of the coating [94]. Important to note is that with this technique, monoliths need to be coated in batches, since continued coating may result in an increase in the viscosity of the slurry mixture. This increase in viscosity may seriously impact the homogeneity and reproducibility of the coating. Also, upon repeated coating, the slurry will become more viscous than the initial concentration, until a point is reached where each coat adds excessive weight on the monolith, coherently affecting homogeneity. Capillary forces allow for water to be drawn into the pores of the monolith structure which creates competition for adherence of the slurry [108]. An intermediate pre-wetting step, discussed by Mogalicherla and Kunzru, allows for a high washcoat loading to be achieved [108]. Agrafiotis and Tsetsekou have reported an optimum slurry concentration of 45 wt % solids and viscosity between 50 and 150 mPa·s [94]. In comparison, Villegas et al. reported homogeneous gamma-alumina coating with 25 wt % solids [90].

(p9.2) Dispersible powders of boehmite or aluminium hydroxide can be used to produce γ-alumina on the monolith surface after calcination [90,96]. It was reported, however, that an average particle size of alumina of 3 µm allowed for a higher loading of alumina and good adhesion properties, as compared to boehmite type powders [90]. Slurry coating may, therefore, be ideal for a high weight percent coating and the particle size of the alumina being coated may be controlled. Slurry coating can offer fewer coating repetitions and good adherence of γ-alumina. Considering advantages such as these, slurry coating may be more practical and less time consuming than the other coating approaches mentioned.
## (s21) Catalytic Combustion

(p21.0) Catalytic combustion offers an alternative means for the production of energy (power generation) compared to the previously established gas-phase combustion process, which needs to be operated within flammability limits and can produce undesired NO x gases [215]. In the catalytic combustion approach, methane or natural gas can be converted over a noble metal-based catalyst to drive a gas-turbine for power generation [248][249][250]. Alternatively, syngas can be converted to power in a more portable/smaller scale. This can be achieved by catalytically stabilized thermal combustion, which is currently being investigated by e.g., the Combustion Research Group at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland) [251][252][253][254][255][256][257][258][259]. In these studies, the researchers focus on converting fuel/syngas mixtures, via a combination of heterogeneous-homogeneous reactions, over platinum-based catalysts coated onto micro-channels.

(p21.1) Noble metal-based catalysts, though, can be expensive. In methane combustion, noble metal-based catalysts can also be susceptible to poisoning or thermal stress [260]. Even when supported on monolithic structures, noble metal-based catalysts are expensive and would still be exposed to sintering at the high temperatures employed [261].
