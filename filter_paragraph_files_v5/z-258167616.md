(p12.0) The second most common cancer with high prevalence of the MSI phenotype is endometrial carcinoma (EC). The efficacy of pembrolizumab for the treatment of metastatic MSI EC was established in the KEYNOTE-158 trial. In the pretreated patients (n = 79), the ORR was 48%, median PFS was 13.1 months, and median OS was not reached [220]. Pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib showed a numerically lower ORR in the KEYNOTE-775 trial. The study evaluated the efficacy of this combination in patients with pretreated EC with or without dMMR. In the dMMR cohort (n = 65), the ORR was 40%, compared to 12% in the chemotherapy cohort (n = 65) [221]. In the pMMR cohort (n = 346), the ORR was 30% in the experimental group and 15% in the chemotherapy group (n = 351) [221].
