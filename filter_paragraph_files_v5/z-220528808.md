(p0.0) Soil is the final destination of heavy metals (HMs) whether they are from natural or anthropogenic sources. Mineral resource exploiting and smelting [1], metal electroplating [2], paint and coating processing [3], electronic equipment manufacturing [4], farmland sewage irrigating [5] and pesticide and chemical fertilizer nonstandard applying [6] are the primary anthropogenic activities that aggravate HMs contamination in soil. For instance, more than 30,000 tons of chromium and 800,000 tons of lead have been released into the environment globally in the past half century, most of which eventually accumulates in soils [7]. It is reported that approximately one-sixth of the total agricultural land area in China and about 600,000 hectares of brown field sites in America have been contaminated by HMs [8]. Hitherto, cadmium, lead and arsenic pollution, and associated ecological health risks in southeast China, are more severe than those in northwest China; similarly, those in industrial regions are worse  [44,51] Fast pyrolysis can be defined as the thermochemical decomposition process of biomass with low energy density at a moderate pyrolysis temperature in the presence of little or no oxygen. Due to the characteristics of higher heating rate (>200 K min -1 ) and shorter residence time (<2 s) in this process, bio-oil with high energy density, syngas with relatively low energy density and a small amount of biochar can be obtained (Table 1) [52]. On the contrary, slow pyrolysis is the common type of pyrolysis which is conducive to the formation of biochar rather than the generation of liquid and gaseous products. In this process, the biomass is pyrolyzed in a wide range of carbonization temperature with a heating rate of about 0.1~1°C s -1 for a residence time between few hours and even days [52]. During slow pyrolysis, the fixed carbon content of biochar may increase with the rise of peak temperature, which is particularly prominent in the range of 400~500 • C [44]. The operating conditions of intermediate pyrolysis are between fast pyrolysis and slow pyrolysis, which better balances the distribution of solid-liquid product yield. The biochar produced by this pyrolysis mode has a brittle structure and does not contain a high quantity of reactive tar, which is suitable for the application of solid fuel, soil amendments and fertilizer [46].
## (s2) Elemental Composition

(p2.0) Element composition and content of biochar are a function of biomass species and pyrolysis temperature [54]. Generally, the content of total N, P, K, Ca, Mg and other nutrient elements in biochar prepared from poultry manure is higher than that of woody biomass, while the content of total C is the opposite [55]. Meanwhile, poultry manure is rich in mineral elements like K and P, which are important for plant growth, and thus the poultry-manure-derived biochar may be suitable as an ideal soil amendment instead of fertilizer [56].

(p2.1) The rise in pyrolysis temperature of biomass commonly results in the increase of ash and C content of biochar [50,57]. The N content of lignocellulosic type biochar increased slightly with the rise of pyrolysis temperature [58,59], while that of animal-manure-and sewage-sludge-derived biochar shows a downward trend [35,[60][61][62]. Furthermore, the pyrolysis conditions of biomass such as a higher temperature and longer residence time are beneficial to the accumulation of total P and K [50,63], the release of Ca, Mg and Si, and the retention of Fe, Mn and S [47]. Correspondingly, with the increase in reaction time and temperature, other unstable substances (containing H and O elements) of biomass are removed by deoxygenation, dehydration and decarboxylation reactions progressively, which leads to the loss of volatile organic compounds and the reduction of H/C-O/C ratio [51,57,64,65]. These results indicate that the high-temperature biochar more easily forms a very stable crystal graphite-like structure and possesses a higher carbonization degree and more aromatic structures [66][67][68]. For example, Jindo et al. [66] reported that the O/C ratio of biochar pyrolyzed in the temperature range of 400~500 • C changed according to the following order: rice straw > rice husk > wood chips of apple tree > wood chips of oak tree. Therefore, these results indicate that there is a higher content of lignin and a slower mineralization rate in woody biomass (i.e., apple tree, oak tree), compared with herbaceous biochar (i.e., rice straw, rice husk) and sewage sludge biochar; furthermore, it has a lower O/C ratio, making woody biochar's structure more stable [67].
## (s4) Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) and Specific Surface Area (SSA)
Number of References: 6

(p4.0) With the pyrolysis processes conducting, the SSA (specific surface area) value of biochar has significantly increased compared to the feedstock, while the relatively low temperature pyrolyzed biochar has the highest CEC (cation exchange capacity) value [73]. Although high-temperature biochar cannot possess the highest CEC and SSA values simultaneously, there are adequate functional groups remaining in the biochar structures to provide negative charges. The low O/C atomic ratio of high-temperature biochar results in a decrease in the CEC value, which is mainly manifested by the reduction of volatile organic compounds and acidic functional groups [74]. In other words, the high SSA and pH value of biochar pyrolyzed at higher temperatures (>600 • C) may compensate for the low CEC value to supply greater CEC provision to soil [54]. Thereby, biochar is a combination of charged surface functional groups and specific surface area, which can combine with HMs by adsorption and complexation reactions. For example, Yuan et al. [75] raised the pyrolysis temperature of sewage sludge from 300 • C to 700 • C, and found that the O/C ratio of biochar decreased from 0.33 to 0.05 and the volatile matter content reduced from 27.4% to 5.5%, but the SSA value increased from 14.37 m 2 g −1 to 26.70 m 2 g −1 . Similarly, Heitkötter et al. [76] used corn digestate (derived from maize silage) as feedstock, as the temperature increased from 400 • C to 600 • C, the CEC value decreased by 29.9%, but the SSA value increased by 50.7% which exactly made up for the deficiencies in the CEC value reduction. The cation exchange capacity of biochar was enhanced by the tendency of attracting positive charges through its surface functional groups, which is an important feature for the remediation of HM-contaminated soil [77]. Furthermore, the porosity and pore size of biochar still depend on pyrolysis temperature, because the release of volatile organic compounds at higher pyrolysis temperatures may promote the formation of micropores.
## (s11) Lead (Pb)
Number of References: 7

(p11.0) The immobilization process of Pb in soils by biochar is relatively simple. For example, Ahmad et al. [25] considered that the immobilization process of Pb stimulated by soybean-stover -derived biochar is attributed to the π-cation electron donor-acceptor interaction, which occurs by the π-electron-rich biochar graphene surface and π-electron-deficient positively charged Pb(II) ion. Furthermore, the cation exchange and precipitation reactions between basic substances (CO 3 2− , OH − and other alkaline earth Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ) in biochar and Pb(II) are able to achieve a significant immobilization effect of Pb, such as the formation of Pb 3 (CO 3 ) 2 (OH) 2 precipitation. In particular, the poultry-manure-derived biochar [38] and the sewage-sludge-derived biochar [39] contain abundant phosphates, which are able to form insoluble compounds, such as Pb 5 (PO 4 ) 3 Cl, Pb 5 (PO 4 ) 3 OH and β-Pb 9 (PO 4 ) 6 , with Pb(II) to reduce the mobility of Pb [25,101]. The functional groups also have certain effects on the immobilization of Pb. Igalavithana et al. [100] reported that the vegetable-waste-derived biochar not only improved soil pH value, but also promoted the immobilization of Pb by the strong covalent bonding action of N-containing functional groups (especially for -NH 2 ) on the biochar surface, thereby effectively decreasing the concentration of NH 4 OAc-extractable Pb.
## (s12) Mercury (Hg)
Number of References: 5

(p12.0) Hg, as a special metal, has great toxicity in soil, but biochar is an effective tool for soil remediation. As Wang et al. [31] remarked, the carboxyl group in a hardwood-derived biochar surface and soil Hg(II) ion develop a coordination reaction generating a complex of -COOHg + precipitate, thereby reducing the mobility of Hg and the thiol functionalities and sulfoxide groups are also able to react with Hg(II) ion to form -S(Hg)-and [Hg(OSR 2 ) 6 2+ ] precipitates. Additionally, Xing et al. [28] found that rice-husk-derived biochar possesses a higher sulfate concentration compared with wheat-straw-derived biochar, which is more effective to promote the mercury-sulfur coordination reaction and to produce sulfides precipitation. It is extremely important to know that methylation of Hg is a special environmental biogeochemical behavior, and once the inorganic-Hg in soils is converted into methylmercury (MeHg), its toxicity and bioaccumulation will be enormously enhanced [108]. The release of rice root exudates reduced soil pH value, thereby enhancing the methylation of Hg, while the application of alkaline biochar increases soil pH value and effectively inhibits methylation. Zhang et al. [41] reported that sewage-sludge-derived biochar with high organic matter content can stimulate the growth and activity of heterotrophic microorganisms in Hg-contaminated acidic farmland soil, thus promoting the formation of MeHg. However, the utilization rate of MeHg in rice has been significantly decreased, which led to the inhibition of MeHg accumulation in rice and effectively reduced the bioavailability of organic-Hg [41].
## (s15) Potential Risks
Number of References: 17

(p15.0) Applying biochar as an addition to soil in-situ remediation should not only consider the HM immobilization/mobilization effects, but also take into account the long-term stability and potential ecological risks of biochar, which similarly depend on the type and performance characteristics of biochar. Figure 2 briefly introduced the advantages and disadvantages of biochar in the remediation of soil HM contamination. Firstly, it is reported that biochar may be the carrier of HMs [116], volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [117], dioxin (PCDD/Fs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [118,119] and other toxic substances, and the demands for remediation of HM contamination in soil varies from 1.5 to 72 t ha −1 or even higher [24,28,98,113]. Therefore, the toxic substances may be released into the soil/air/water environment with the application of the double-edged biochar, which will pose a secondary pollution and ecological risk. So far, from the perspective of soil, biochar plays an important role in the carbon utilization and non-CO 2 greenhouse gases emission reduction [104]. However, the research on increasing greenhouse gas emissions by biochar has also been reported, i.e., under specific conditions, the application of biochar can promote the emissions of CO 2 [120], N 2 O [121], CH 4 [122] to a certain extent. For example, although biochar can reduce CH 4 emissions, it may also promote N 2 O emissions, and vice versa, and this depends on the diversity of biochar application conditions. Therefore, the emission reduction effect of biochar cannot be reflected in all types of greenhouse gases, and blind application may cause negative effects, so the biochar-greenhouse gas interaction should be considered in the field application of biochar. Meanwhile, other research has indicated that biochar can inhibit the efficacy of soil pesticides and their biodegradation effects [123], which makes the ability of agricultural weeding and insecticides unable to achieve the expected effects. The residue of pesticides may be related to the strong adsorption and binding capacity of biochar. Furthermore, although biochar can improve the biological activity of bacteria (e.g., Geobacter, Anaeromyxobacter and Clostridium) [26,96], it may bring about a negative impact on the survival, growth and diversity of, for example, acidophilic earthworm and fungi biological communities [124,125].
