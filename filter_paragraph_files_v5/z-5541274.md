(p24.0) Many of the trials and interventions in the management of postpartum hemorrhage have concentrated on the implementation of drills and treatments [63]. However, the diagnosis of hemorrhage is of primary concern and the importance of the accurate estimation of blood loss is paramount to allowing the appropriate intervention by warning of impending hemorrhagic shock. Estimates of blood loss by paramedics [64], surgeons [65] and obstetricians and midwives [66] are often inaccurate and vary widely. Studies following vaginal [67] and abdominal delivery [68] show visual estimation of blood loss to be of limited clinical use.

(p24.1) Bose et al [66], demonstrated a marked discrepancy between estimated and actual blood loss at varying volumes confirming the clinical difficulty in accurately estimating blood loss, particularly in obstetric scenarios. They developed a simple algorithm to facilitate visual estimation and felt that these along with clinical reconstructions provided a popular and useful learning tool to facilitate the visual estimation of blood loss. This has been confirmed [69].
