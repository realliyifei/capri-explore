(p5.0) Several SIDS locations around the Caribbean have recently reported severe coastal erosion anecdotally or through local shoreline surveys. These reports require further formal study in terms of local understandings, quantitative tracking, and attribution to climate change. For instance, climate change was thought to be causing beach erosion in Barbados until locally caused ecosystem damage was found to play the predominant role (Mycoo 2014). Good practice case studies also exist, but require formal research for verification. In Anseà la Mouche, Seychelles, the government instituted coastal protection through land reclamation in 2013, creating a local park which supported local ownership and protected a main road. Such locally focused green spaces are known to promote mental health and wellbeing (Nieuwenhuijsen and Khreis 2017), but the developments in Anseà la Mouche (and elsewhere around SIDS, e.g. Havana (Orta Ortiz and Geneletti 2018)) have not been formally evaluated with respect to their local and national influences on health and wellbeing.
