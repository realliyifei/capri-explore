## (s6) Results of harm reduction interventions and HIV prevention among drug users in China
Number of References: 23

(p6.0) The results of the empirical studies [5,[35][36][37][38][39][40][41] in China revealed that most of the interventions on harm reduction (e.g. MMT and NEP) and HIV prevention (e.g. VCT) were successful and had positive effects in reducing drug related risk behaviors among drug users in both institution-based and community-based programs. For example, two MMT intervention studies showed that the use of MMT decreased the frequency of IDU and criminal behaviors [37]. Three needle related studies revealed a significant reduction of needle-sharing among drug users [40,41] and a decline of new drug injectors in the follow-survey [39]. Results of VCT studies documented that participants increased their HIV/AIDS knowledge [35], increased condom use with regular and casual sex partners, and decreased needle-sharing [36]. Two HIV knowledge-oriented studies have shown that participants, after receiving the intervention, increased their HIV-related knowledge, their understanding of HIV prevention methods, and indicated positive attitudes toward those with HIV/AIDS [38,42]. These positive results are consistent with the large body of empirical evidence on effectiveness of harm reduction programs in other countries [43][44][45][46][47][48][49].
