## (s4) Communication Link
Number of References: 2

(p4.0) Communication link uses a radio-frequency (RF) medium to transmit and receive information packet to and from the UAV. There are various frequencies currently deployed. The deployed frequencies are based on UAV brand as well as functionality of the UAV. As seen in certain UAVs, frequencies, such as 433 MHz and 915 MHz, are used for telemetry, while 1.2 GHz and 2.4 GHz are used for video transmission [10,15]. The 433 MHz and 915 MHz are used because of their longer transmitting range capability. However, they suffer from low bandwidth and, hence, are not ideal to transmit video signals. The major disadvantage of using 1.2 GHz and 2.4 GHz is that they are simply designed for short range.

(p9.0) Antennas deployed in a UAV tracking system must conform to either as a steering beam (SB) or an array antenna (AA) format. The SB configuration involves just only one antenna unit, such as parabolic dish. However, the AA entails the fusion of many micro antenna elements to functions as an antenna structure. In this section, we present a brief overview on the different antenna and antenna arrays suitable for deployment as a UAV antenna tracking system. Some of the examples of the notable antennas are classified, as shown in Figure 3 and discussed hereafter. is the simplest and most reliable algorithm, it suffers from a lack of stringent pointing accuracy and, hence, cannot be used to control large antennas. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a LQG algorithm. LQG is equipped with a shorter response time and turbulence rejection attributes. The LQG can be further enhanced by the use of H∞. The H∞ algorithm is noted for acceleration limits because of the existing motor drives and gear system. This limitation can be addressed by the use of command pre-processor in software that modifies antenna commands. Reference [38] implemented an antenna control system using a step algorithm method around H∞ control algorithm. Results indicate that the algorithm was able to overcome significant torque disturbances from wind pressures and gusts on the antenna structures, as well as bearing and aerodynamic frictions. Reference [39] presented an overview on the development and application of antenna control systems, while [40] presented performance analysis of PID and LQG control algorithms for antenna position control system.

(p11.0) Wire antenna is a radio antenna with a long wire suspended above the ground. Although ground terminal is very crucial in antenna transmission range, in this specific design, the ground plays a dominant role. The length of the wire has no effect on the wavelength of the radio used, but for convenience instead [41,42]. The wire can be straight or strung forth and back between walls and trees. This type of antenna is not as effective as those antennas whose length are adjustable to resonate to the wavelength intended.

## (s15) Left Handed Dipole Antenna
Number of References: 2

(p15.0) The left-handed dipole antenna is a new kind of antenna. Its name derives from its left-handed mode of transmission [45,46]. The design of this antenna is fundamentally built on shunt inductors and capacitors. The capacitor is placed by the line that prompts current of different amplitude on either side. This current does not totally cross out in the far-field, thus, it transmits.

(p16.0) The folded dipole antenna is one of the simplest and cheapest antenna extensively deployed in wireless transmission. It is compact and can be easily manufactured and installed. The design is based on the wires folded but with open ends. The folded dipole antennas are wide loop in nature. The radiation pattern of a folded dipole antenna is the same as that of a dipole antenna [47][48][49]. These antennas attributes help the antenna to gain traction, as dipole antennas are known to have high directivity and high gain.

## (s28) Reflector Antenna
Number of References: 11

(p28.0) The reflector antenna simply modifies the radiation pattern of an antenna by redirecting the received electromagnetic energy in the range of the electromagnetic spectrum wavelength, thereby increasing the gain in a particular direction. The antenna arrangement prohibits radiation in backwards and sideways direction and, as such, they are more directional [61,62]. A prototype of reconfigurable corner reflector using PIN-diode-switched frequency selective surfaces (FSS) has been developed [63]. A reflector aperture angle of 45° is prototyped for application at 4 GHz, and its pattern characteristics are altered by on-off state biasing of the PIN diodes. Readers interested in the theory of corner reflectors with tilted dipole can consult [64].

(p28.1) The parabolic reflector antenna has two types. The first is the right cylinder while the second one is paraboloid. The cylinder type uses linear array, linear dipole, and slotted The antenna arrangement prohibits radiation in backwards and sideways direction and, as such, they are more directional [61,62]. A prototype of reconfigurable corner reflector using PIN-diode-switched frequency selective surfaces (FSS) has been developed [63].

Readers interested in the theory of corner reflectors with tilted dipole can consult [64]. The parabolic reflector antenna has two types. The first is the right cylinder while the second one is paraboloid. The cylinder type uses linear array, linear dipole, and slotted wavelength to feed. The paraboloid, on the other hand, uses pyramidal or paraboloid conical to feed. The radiation pattern of this antenna is strongly determined by the radiation pattern of the feeder used as well as the reflector measurements and material [65,66]. An evaluation study on the desirability of defocusing a large-sized multi-beam hybrid parabolic antenna (MBHPA) has been performed [67]. Defocusing means displacement of the AA from the focus, in the interests of rarefaction of the AA. Results indicate that the idea of defocusing, which is tempting at first glance, does not benefit in the gain factor of the beams in comparison with un-displaced AA with the same spacing of the array elements.
## (s30) Bowtie Antenna
Number of References: 2

(p30.0) The demand for low-cost, effective, and less-weight antennas in the communication network and multi-band application has brought about the design of this antenna. Recently, communication network requires light, easy working, and moveable antennas. Due to its structure, it is known as a butterfly antenna. There are different types of bowtie antenna: the bowtie slot antenna, the double-sided triangular bowtie antenna, the bowtie antenna microstrip fed, the slotted bowtie patch antenna, and the CPW fed curved bow tie slot antenna. The bow tie antenna has two mirrors placed on a rectangular patch. The output of this design is limited by distance and the alignment of the mirrors. This type of antennas are widely used in mobile communication networks and wireless systems [68,69]. Figure 8 demonstrates the bowtie antenna.

(p31.0) This antenna is always very handy in cases where there are wideband applications. It operates in a VHF range from 30 MHz to 300 MHz. The bandwidth of the antenna is usually greater than 10:1, and they are referred to as independent antenna. The features of this antenna, such as gain, input impedance, and radiation, changes periodically with respect to the logarithm of the frequency space. This is referred to as a log-periodic array [70,71]. Figure 9 demonstrates the structure of the log-periodic dipole array antenna. to the logarithm of the frequency space.

## (s38) Array Antenna Model
Number of References: 4

(p38.0) Imagine an arbitrary array antenna consisting of several radiating elements M separated by a distance d. Arrays are primarily used as directors to align the incident and reflected signals to a desired beamwidth. Thus, the array factor (AF) of the incoming signal is modelled as [82,83]: AF(θ) = 1 + e jΦ + e 2jΦ + · · · + e (M−1)jΦ (1) where array phase function (Φ) = kdsin(θ) + β and the propagation constant (k) = 2π/λ, λ denotes the wavelength, β is the phase angle between the elements, θ is the desired angle of arrival (AoA) of the incoming signal. The propagation constant is a measure of changes in a sinusoidal electromagnetic wave in terms of amplitude and phase, while propagating through a medium. β denotes a control parameter which steers the antenna between the broad side and the end-fire. In other words, it is responsible for cancelling out the interference, resulting from the various antenna elements. When β = 0 • , then θ = 90 • . This configuration is known as the end-fire condition and the received signal is maximum. On the contrary, when β = 180 • , then θ = 180 • , then broadside occurs, signifying the worst received signal strength. Increasing the array elements results in high directivity, high gain, and low beam width, as shown in Table 1. Thus, having a higher number of array elements, as observed in Yagi, log-periodic, helical antenna results in high gain. The close format of AF is stated as [84]:
## (s43) Ground-to-Air Tracking Antenna
Number of References: 4

(p43.0) Ground-to-air antenna tracking systems relies on the determination, measurement, and comparison of signal strength gradient from the GCS to the airborne platform. This scheme motivates the search for the optimal elevation and azimuth angle between the two antennas involved [86,87]. The ground-to-air tracking antenna system is a very simple and efficient approach of tracking a target without knowledge of the air vehicle attitudes. The use of a circularly polarized microstrip antenna array to increase the bandwidth in S-band for UAV ground to air transmission has been explored [88]. The simulation results of the array element showed that its relative bandwidth is 21.7% with gain greater than 5 dBi and VSWR ≤ 1.25. Similarly, reference [31] built an antenna tracker using GPS and a 32-bit microcontroller, which is of two degrees of freedom. The system took into consideration the altitude of the vehicle and was able to provide an azimuth angle of 360 degrees and a pitch angle of 90 degrees. This approach will be ideal for a UAV case, considering the fact that airborne platform is constrained by weight, size and power (swap).
## (s44) Air-to-Ground Tracking Antenna
Number of References: 4

(p44.0) This technique is not as popular as the ground-to-air type of tracking systems. In this design, the tracking is performed by the airborne platform. For the case of the UAV, the UAV uses a directional antenna to send the signal while an omnidirectional antenna is solely for the tracking antenna. The directional antenna on the UAV is desirable because it reduces the burden of detecting the angle of arrival (AoA) of the arrived signal. Despite its challenges, some authors have deployed this scheme [89,90]. Their result shows that the tracking antenna continuously keeps track of and aligns with the base station and GCS, respectively, with the minimum error possible. However, this design is limited to ground based vehicles provided there is an available LoS between the sender and receiver. Reference [91] presented a brief overview of waveforms for UAV air-to-ground communication systems. The researchers broadly divided the modulation schemes into single carrier and multicarrier. The single carrier modulation are: QPSK, APSK, OFDM, MQAM, GMSK, MSK, SOQPSK, SC-FDE. However, the multicarrier is the OFDM. Additionally, [92] conducted air-to-ground UAV tracking although using a MIMO beam-forming technique which showed promising results.
## (s55) Transmit Diversity
Number of References: 3

(p55.0) Transmit diversity is the reverse of the receive diversity. In transmit diversity, the transmitter is equipped with multiple antennas at the transmitter to introduce diversity by transmitting redundant versions of the same signal. The Alamouti technique is a popular algorithm among the transmit diversity techniques [138]. There are various versions of transmit diversity, such as space-time block coding (STBC) and space-frequency block coding (SFBC). With STBC [139,140], signals are mapped as space and time to exploit the diversity present in the time domain. SFBC is operationally different from STBC because

(p56.0) Transmit diversity is the reverse of the receive diversity. In transmit diversity, the transmitter is equipped with multiple antennas at the transmitter to introduce diversity by transmitting redundant versions of the same signal. The Alamouti technique is a popular algorithm among the transmit diversity techniques [138]. There are various versions of transmit diversity, such as space-time block coding (STBC) and space-frequency block coding (SFBC). With STBC [139,140], signals are mapped as space and time to exploit the diversity present in the time domain. SFBC is operationally different from STBC because it exploits the antenna spacing and frequency domains encoding in the antenna [141,142]. Just like in receive diversity, transmit diversity does not increase UAV tracking antenna data rates. However, the scheme can enhance link reliability which is the primary goal of the UAV tracking antenna system. Both STBC and SFBC signals can be received using appropriate finite filter design.
## (s57) Spatial Multiplexing
Number of References: 6

(p57.0) Spatial multiplexing involves the transmission of independent parallel information streams to boast the data rate and enhance spectrum efficiency. Spatial multiplexing allows the system designer to use a different modulation code to modulate information bits and send them to various antenna ports [143,144]. The two most notable spatial multiplexing receiver algorithms are zero forcing (ZF) [145,146] and minimum meansquare error (MMSE) [147,148]. A schematic diagram of spatial multiplexing is depicted in Figure 15. Spatial multiplexing in MIMO are of two variants namely, single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) and multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO). In SU-MIMO design configuration, all the elements of the signal vector ⃗ belong to a single user in this case, and perhaps for one UAV receiver array antenna. While, in MU-MIMO, the data streams of different users are multiplexed on different antenna and transmitted over the wireless channel coefficient ℎ. In the context of UAV tracking antenna, this might involve transmitting the tracking parameters and information signals simultaneously.

(p64.0) Energy Efficiency: Generally, UAVs suffer from the problem of reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP). Energy efficiency is crucial to UAV antenna tracking, especially when mechanical beam steering tracking is involved [164,165]. Energy efficiency will also become critical if MU-MIMO is adopted as the core of UAV antenna tracking. Hence, more system modelling and energy efficiency is needed. ii.

(p64.1) Wireless Channel Model: There is a need for adequate UAV wireless channel modelling, considering the fact that UAV is generally regarded as a LoS communication system. This assumption might not be feasible considering that there are lots UAV hobbist in crowded urban areas [166,167]. Secondly, the transmission range of UAVs varies according to the equipped transceiver pairs. It is plausible that the dynamic channel model will be develop to cater for this variation. iii.
