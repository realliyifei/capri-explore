## (s1) Definitions
Number of References: 15

(p1.0) The definition of carotid plaque ulceration varies depending on the modality used or even among different research groups [10,15]. In terms of histology, the term Bulcera-tion^describes an endothelial defect of at least 1000 μm in width, resulting in the exposure of the plaque's necrotic core to circulation [7,16]. From the point of view of imaging, different criteria have been used to define ulceration [10,15]. In general, a plaque's surface can be characterised as smooth, irregular or ulcerated [4], with smooth referring to a plaque with regular luminal morphology (Fig. 1). The term irregular can be used for  Ulcer with distal neck and its main part pointing proximally, opposite to blood flow direction plaques whose surface fluctuates from 0.3 mm to 0.9 mm [4], whereas the term ulceration is reserved for cavities measuring at least 1 mm [7,13] [15]. According to the newer criteria, ulcerations can be diagnosed when there is evidence of a cavity on the plaque surface, irrespective of size, whose surface echogenicity is lower compared to the adjacent intimal plaque's border on B-mode [10]. On MDCTA, an ulceration can be diagnosed when contrast medium is identified extending beyond the vascular lumen (and within the plaque limits) for at least 1 mm in at least two planes [13]. On CEUS, which is virtually an angiographic technique, the ulcer definition requires the interruption of the plaque-lumen border for at least 1 × 1 mm [13]. When it comes to 3D US, the volume criterion of a cavity measuring at least 1 mm 3 has been used [19].
## (s2) Frequency/location of ulceration
Number of References: 15

(p2.0) Carotid MDCTA studies have shown that 55-62% of plaques are smooth, 15-22% irregular and 16-44% ulcerated [13,20,21]. The frequency of carotid ulcerations depends on the presence of symptoms and the modality used. Histological ulcerations have been reported to occur in up to 89% of cases [22]. In a study enrolling more than 3000 patients examined with DSA, the frequency of ulceration was 14% [23]. In MDCTA studies, ulceration was discovered in 10-31% of carotid plaques [7,21,24]. There is a documented difference of ulcer frequency between asymptomatic and symptomatic plaques with the former being ulcerated in 14% of cases and the latter in 36% [25]. Other studies have detected ulcers in 48% of symptomatic plaques and 31% of asymptomatic [26]. Studies have shown that ulcerations are more likely to affect the part of a plaque lying proximally to the point of maximum stenosis (up to 70% of cases) rather than distally. This observation is explained by the higher shear stress applied to the part of the plaque proximal to the point of maximum stenosis [7,20,23]. The ulcer frequency is also associated with the degree of stenosis. Namely, ulcer incidence was 16.6% for plaques causing 50-69% stenosis, 22.6% for 70-84% stenosis and 33.4% for stenosis >85% [7]. Other studies have identified a significant percentage of ulcerations in plaques causing <50% stenosis [24].
## (s5) Composition of ulcerated carotid plaques

(p5.0) It is well known that ulcerations are not found in all carotid plaques with the same frequency but rather tend to occur in particular plaque types and are associated with specific histological findings. Namely, it was found that plaques with either ulcerations or simply irregular surfaces, based on DSA, were associated with rupture of the plaque's fibrous cap, intraplaque haemorrhage, a large lipid core and less fibrous tissue [49]. These initial DSA findings warranted further research of ulcerated plaque's composition with modern cross-sectional modalities [49]. Based on publications related to US and MDCTA, ulcerations were found to more often affect fatty plaques, less often fibrous and rarely calcified plaques [7]. From a pathogenic point of view, it is expected that ulceration is associated with intraplaque haemorrhage [50]. More precisely, MDCTA-detected ulceration is considered a risk factor for intraplaque haemorrhage [51]. In keeping with these findings, ulceration diagnosed on MDCTA is considered highly sensitive and specific for the presence of intraplaque haemorrhage as identified on MRI [52]. It was also observed that ulcerated plaques tend to be larger in volume and richer in lipid content [24,53]. On the contrary, ulceration was found to be inversely associated with calcification [24]. Other studies could not confirm the association between ulceration and plaque volume, highlighting the fact that even smaller plaques may be ulcerated [53]. The association between ulceration and fatty hypoechoic plaques has also been reported with US [54]. Finally, it was observed that the plaque's enhancement on MDCTA is strongly related with the presence of ulceration and neovascularisation [55,56]. Indeed, studies with CEUS have demonstrated neovessels in close proximity to ulcerations [57] and that ulcerated plaques tend to have significantly more intraplaque neovessels compared to smooth plaques [58] (Figs. 6 and 7). In MRI studies, it was similarly concluded that lipid-necrotic content was a strong predictor for a new surface disruption in the form of either ulceration or fibrous cap rupture [59]. MRI studies confirmed the weak association between ulcerations and calcifications [59].
## (s6) Do ulcerated carotid plaques heal?

(p6.0) Once an ulcerated carotid plaque is diagnosed, a reasonable question occurring is how long will it take for it to heal. In general, it remains unknown how long an ulceration takes to heal although there are reports of cases healed after a few months [60]. MRI has been used to monitor the ulceration healing process in a dynamic way, demonstrating the creation of a new fibrous cap covering the ulcer cavity [60]. Other researchers have used 3D US to monitor ulcerated plaques prospectively for more than a year, reporting that the vast majority of plaques (76.5%) remained unchanged, 23.5% of ulcerations regressed while only 5.8% of ulcerations progressed [61]. In accordance with these results, another research group followed up carotid plaques with MDCTA for a period of approximately 2 years, concluding that 88% of plaques remained stable, 8% of plaques showed more surface irregularities while 4% of plaques were smoother. As for the ulcerated plaques, 67% of them showed no change on follow-up, while some of them regressed and only one progressed. This study also identified new ulcerations in previously non-ulcerated plaques [21].

(p7.0) The discussion regarding the optimal imaging modality for diagnosis of carotid ulcerations has been ongoing since 1986 when US was considered superior to angiography for diagnosing ulceration [62]. Given the fact that US is the first-line modality for evaluation of carotid arteries, it is expected that this technique has been extensively investigated with conflicting results regarding the diagnostic accuracy for ulceration [32,[63][64][65][66][67]. Some studies showed high sensitivity and specificity [32,65], while different researchers concluded that US is inadequate for diagnosing ulcers because of its low sensitivity (23-47%) [66,68,69], which was higher in plaques with <50% stenosis [69]. Similarly, correlation of US with histology was poor [70]. Beyond its low accuracy, US has been found to be characterised by low inter-observer agreement for ulceration [71]. Based on the technological advances in the field of US including modern transducers and image optimisation techniques, it is expected that current US devices may provide improved accuracy for diagnosing carotid ulceration [72]. The diversity in results regarding US accuracy may also be explained by the use of different diagnostic criteria and definitions for ulceration between different studies. Some studies have used flow reversal on colour Doppler for diagnosing ulceration [32]. The previously described de Bray criteria are among the most widely used in the literature [61,71,[73][74][75][76]. Nevertheless, a recent study using histology as the reference method has shown that these criteria are only 35.7% sensitive and 75% specific [10]. The size criterion proved inaccurate, with histology detecting ulcers smaller than 2 mm and cavities larger than 2 mm not characterised as ulcers on histology. The newer criteria proposed were 85.7% sensitive and 81.3% specific, outperforming de Bray's criteria [10]. Although US improved diagnostic accuracy with these new criteria, the acoustic shadow caused by calcified plaques still represents an inherent limitation of US [10]. The low echogenicity of the ulcer base compared to the nearby endothelium reflects the lower acoustic impedance of soft tissues such as thrombus compared to the plaque fibrous cap or normal endothelium. If this echogenicity criterion is not fulfilled, then a concavity on a plaque surface may not truly represent an ulcer but rather a simple cavity or even normal endothelium lying between two juxtapositioned plaques [10]. Other pitfalls in US interpretation potentially leading to false-positive results include mirror image artefact, which refers to the artefactual visualisation of flow within a plaque [76]. Beyond imaging the ulcer itself, modern US studies have evaluated new indirect findings such as a fine trembling motion of echogenic structures inside the plaque, which was found 93% sensitive and 60% specific [77].

(p8.0) CEUS has also been introduced in carotid arteries and investigated in plaque surface evaluation and identification of irregularities and ulcerations, showing better results than conventional US [14,[78][79][80][81][82][83][84]. A recent study compared US and CEUS in the diagnosis of carotid ulcerations having MDCTA as the reference method. CEUS outperformed US in terms of sensitivity, intra-and inter-reader agreement [13]. Similar subsequent studies have used CEUS for the detection of ulcerations in asymptomatic patients with diabetes [85]. Another recent study confirmed CEUS's superiority to conventional US for diagnosing histological carotid plaque rupture. Using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the calculated optimal cut-off values of a cavity's orifice, depth and width for the diagnosis of fibrous cap disruption were 1.4 mm, 1.3 mm and 1.88 mm respectively [86]. The Bflow technique is yet another US technique that can be used as an alternative to the Doppler technique and has been used for detection of carotid ulcers, with greater diagnostic accuracy than the colour Doppler technique [74,87]. Using this technique, a swirling pattern of blood flow was demonstrated within ulcer cavities, a finding in keeping with previous experimental and US observations [33,88]. Attempts to overcome ultrasound's limitation of two-dimensional images are  Fig. 4a). Axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image confirming the presence of contrast material within the ulcer's cavity (arrow) (e) made with three-dimensional US, which as expected was found to detect more ulcers than conventional US [89,90].

(p9.0) MDCTA constitutes a valuable modality for the evaluation of carotid disease, with accurate grading of stenosis and fewer complications compared to DSA [7,12]. Early studies have shown good agreement with DSA for the detection of ulcerated plaques [91]. In keeping with these results, MDCTA showed good agreement with histology after endarterectomy [92]. Promising results were also found for MDCTA's ability to characterise plaque's composition compared with histology, although with less accuracy for the detection of ulcers according to some authors [93]. In a study comparing MDCTA, MRA and DSA, it was concluded that both MDCTA and MRA may replace DSA for accurate grading of stenosis. However, MDCTA detected luminal surface irregularities more often thanks to its excellent spatial resolution and, along with MRA, they proved superior to DSA for identification of ulcerations [94].

(p9.1) Studies comparing US and MDCTA have shown little agreement between these methods for both the diagnosis of ulcerations and characterisation of plaques as smooth or irregular [95]. With histology as the reference method, MDCTA proved superior to US, with 93% sensitivity and 98% specificity for diagnosing ulceration whereas the latter was only 37% sensitive and 91% specific [7,96]. Improved accuracy found in this study reflected the use of multidetector technology in comparison with other studies assessing single-detector CT [93,97,98]. MDCTA's ability to readily detect ulcers is partly attributed to the availability of specialised threedimensional reformatting software such as multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), maximum intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendering (VR). MDCTA is not free of limitations though, as thorough evaluation may be hindered by artefacts including beam hardening in heavily calcified plaques [7], which may hide small ulcerations [7,99,100]. In a study comparing various MDCTA techniques for the detection of ulceration, axial images and VR proved to be the most accurate. The overall accuracy of MDCTA, with all techniques deployed, showed 93.9% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity [101]. When reviewing carotid MDCTA scans, it should be kept in mind that hyperdense material projecting outside the vascular lumen may represent either a focal calcification or a true ulceration. To differentiate these entities, a density threshold of 600 Hounsfield units (HU) has been used [13]. Ideally, though, an unenhanced scan should be performed prior to the intravenous contrast administration (Fig. 8).

(p9.2) Conventional angiography is traditionally considered the reference method for grading carotid stenosis although its accuracy for the detection of ulcerations has been questioned [94,98,[102][103][104]. Moreover, it represents an interventional technique associated with a periprocedural risk for thromboembolic events [105]. As a result, modern non-invasive modalities such as MDCTA [97,98] or MRA [106,107] are gradually replacing DSA [7]. Anzidei et al. compared US, MDCTA and MRA with DSA, concluding that MDCTA has excellent diagnostic accuracy with a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value up to 100% for the diagnosis of ulceration, outperforming MRA [108].
## (s10) Magnetic resonance angiography

(p10.0) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has also been used for the diagnosis of ulcerated carotid plaques with good interobserver agreement [109]. Longitudinal black blood cardiovascular MRA improves the technique's sensitivity (80%) and specificity (82.3%) for the detection of ulceration in comparison with simple evaluation of axial images [110]. Contrastenhanced MRA (CEMRA) is considered superior to time-offlight (TOF) MRA for ulceration, which had more falsenegative results (Fig. 9). The main reasons explaining TOF-MRA's lower accuracy include the ulcer's orientation and location in relation to the point of maximum stenosis and geometry in the form of neck-to-depth ratio [111]. MRI's particular strength in detection of ulcerations relies on its ability to image the plaque's fibrous cap as a black zone lying between the bright lumen and the grey plaque content. Absence of this dark zone represents rupture of the fibrous cap and thus ulceration [111,112]. If blood pool agents were used, then CE-MRA was found superior to MDCTA both for grading of stenosis and characterisation of plaque morphology [113].
