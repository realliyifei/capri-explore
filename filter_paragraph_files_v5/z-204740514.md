## (s8) Liver Protection Activity
Number of References: 4

(p8.0) Research showed that limonin possessed an inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) [77]. Moreover, limonin caused a dramatic decrease in residual CYP3A4 activity, thereby suppressing cytochrome P450 3A4 (cyp3A4)-mediated human liver microsomal erythromycin N-demethylation activity. Therefore, it was considered that limonin has a certain hepatoprotective activity [78]. Meanwhile, limonin exhibited a protective effect on hepatic ischemia reperfusion (I/R) liver injury rat, whose mechanism was related to the down-regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-signaling transduction pathway [79]. The study found that pre-administration of limonin can significantly attenuate marker of hepatic damage (elevated liver enzyme activities), hepatic inflammation (TNF-α, neutrophil infiltration), oxidative stress and the expression of TLR-4 in d-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced rats. Thus, it was indicated that the liver protection activity of limonin occurred via attenuating inflammation and oxidative stress [80].
## (s11) Anti-Osteoporosis

(p11.0) Limonin can increase the concentration of calcium in femur and fifth lumbar in orchidectomized rats, in which the mechanism may be related to promoting bone formation [85]. In addition, studies have found that the loss of ovarian function causes the lack of ovarian-related hormones, which leads to the rapid loss of hormone-related bone and eventually leads to osteoporosis [86]. However, limonin can effectively inhibit the reduction of bone mass and promote the increase of bone mineral density in ovariectomised rats. Moreover, in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, limonin stimulated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and enhanced the expression of osteoblast differentiation gene markers by regulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase and P38 signals [87]. We believe that limonin is effective against osteoporosis and deserves further study.
## (s12) Anti-Obesity
Number of References: 3

(p12.0) Previous research has shown that limonin can reduce the LDL cholesterol in HepG2 cells [88]. Subsequent research had found that nomilin (limonoid) can suppress diet-induced obesity in mice by activating G-protein-coupled receptor (TGR5). Although limonin possessed certain anti-obesity effect, it was not a TGR5 activator; thus, particular mechanisms are remain to be investigated [89]. In addition, limonin inhibited the adipocyte differentiation by reducing the expression of the adipocyte-specific gene (PPARγ2). Limonin can also significantly reduce plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels in obese mice. Meanwhile, limonin can increase the mRNA levels of acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (Acox1), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) in liver, which are associated with lipid metabolism [90].

(p14.0) In addition, limonin can non-competitively inhibit arginase to increase L-arginine levels, thereby inhibiting the activation of NADPH oxidase in a PKCβII-dependent manner, and blocking nLDL-stimulated VSMC proliferation in a p21Waf1/Cip1 dependent manner [93]. Therefore, it is considered that limonin can treat vascular diseases associated with VSMC proliferation. Meanwhile, limonin can also exert therapeutic effects on mice with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing the expression of iNOS, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), and COX2, and attenuating oxidative stress in bleomycin-induced lung tissues [94]. Moreover, research had found that limonin possessed a therapeutic effect on experimental gastric ulcer in rats [95]. Interestingly, limonin can inhibit odorant-induced signal transduction pathway (OST) in non-neuronal cells by regulating Ca 2+ influx and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, thereby mediating the physiological functions associated with the olfactory receptor [96].
## (s15) Toxicity
Number of References: 6

(p15.0) The research has shown that limonin is toxic to kidney cells. Limonin (50-200 µg/mL) can significantly inhibit the viability of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293 cells) in a dose-dependent manner, and can shrink, reduce, and even kill kidney cells in varying degrees at the concentration of 100-200 µg/mL [97]. Meanwhile, limonin also exhibited certain cytotoxicity to T lymphocytic cell line (MOLT-3 cells) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [65]. In addition, limonin possesses obvious cytotoxicity to green monkey kidney cell (COS7 cells) and also has certain cytotoxic effects on HeLa cells [70]. Moreover, limonin extracted from the nearly ripe fruits of Evodia rutaecarpa exerted potent cytotoxicity against human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells and human gastric cancer (N-87) cells [98]. A subsequent study found that limonin extracted from citrus aurantifolia seeds had strong cytotoxicity against L5178Y lymphoma cells [99]. It has also been reported that limonin has a strong inhibitory effect on the production of melanin in B16 melanoma cells, but that it has weak cytotoxicity [34].
