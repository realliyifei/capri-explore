(p6.0) A system with a massive array with M = 50 antennas at the BS and terminals with N = 3, which is the same number of antennas considered at the terminals in the openloop setup. Comparing Figures 6 and 7 with Figures 2 and  3, also with two PD-NOMA users and the same modulations, one can see that the performances very similar. This is because the channel models of (11) and (16) are in fact equivalent in terms of end-to-end SNR per user. To understand why this happens one needs to revisit equations (11) and (24) and note that G 1,1 Λ 1 2 1 U 1 = H 1,1 (Karhunen-Loève decomposition) and that v m,k = P 1 = 1. Hence, both equations are in fact equivalent in terms of the ratio between the signal power and the noise power in each of these ZF schemes, when averaging over several channel realizations.
