(p9.0) So far we have looked at one model set in isolation. Now we move on to consider families of model sets. We start with a number of definitions and results. All of these may be found in the paper of M. Schlottmann [36] on which we have relied heavily here. Many are well-known in the context of tilings for which a recent reference with a good bibliography is [38]. In this section all point sets under discussion are assumed to be Delone sets in R d .
