(p0.0) More than four hundred million adults suffer from diabetes mellitus worldwide [1]. Ninety percent of diabetic patients will have some form of retinopathy twenty-five years following diagnosis [2]. Diabetic retinopathy causes blood-retinal barrier breakdown, leading to increased permeability and leakage from retinal capillaries. Fluid accumulates within the retinal layers, resulting in a thickened macula. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most common cause of vision loss in diabetic patients, with a prevalence that ranges from 19% to 65% [3]. This paper reviews the current role of laser for DME in the era of antiangiogenic therapy.

(p11.0) Triamcinolone Plus Prompt Laser for Diabetic Macular Edema (DRCR.net Protocol I Study). In 2010, DRCR network published the first results of a trial comparing sham injections plus prompt laser, 0.5 mg ranibizumab plus prompt laser, 0.5 mg ranibizumab plus deferred laser (24 or more weeks), or 4 mg triamcinolone plus prompt laser in 854 study eyes with visual acuity of 20/32 to 20/320. At 1-year followup, sham injections plus prompt laser and triamcinolone plus prompt laser achieved the lowest results in terms of mean change in the VA letter score from baseline: +3 and +4, respectively; on the contrary, ranibizumab groups gained a mean of +9 letters in this period of time. In the subset of pseudophakic eyes at baseline, visual acuity improvement in the triamcinolone plus prompt laser group was similar to that in the ranibizumab groups [25]. The expanded 2-year results reported were similar to these results [26].
