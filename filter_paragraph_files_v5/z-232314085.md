Number of References: 5

(p33.0) Quality control is important in the construction of new pavements and in the restoration of already existing roads and airfields [78,240,241]. The analysis requires the improvement of signal-to-noise ratio of the GPR scans. Bianchini Ciampoli et al. [240] present and discuss a processing flow to improve the GPR images during the quality control of structures. In these applications, a previous calibration is required to obtain accurate results [217].
