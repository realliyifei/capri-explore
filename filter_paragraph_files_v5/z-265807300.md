(p0.0) The increase in chronic illnesses, particularly cancer, has become a major concern for the well-being of the Chinese population due to factors such as the aging population, mounting living pressures, unhealthy lifestyles, and various other contributors.This worrying trend has been identified as a significant threat to the health of the Chinese people.According to the Global Burden of Disease 2019 (GBD2019) report, cancer was responsible for the death of 2.72 million individuals in China in 2019, accounting for nearly a quarter of all deaths that occurred in the country that year. 1 Contemporary scientific research has made significant progress in the timely detection, management, and overall survival rates of neoplastic diseases.However, individuals diagnosed with tumors or precancerous conditions now face an increased risk of experiencing cardiovascular health issues after undergoing cancer treatment. 2In the past, this risk was not as apparent due to the shorter life expectancy of patients, which limited the time available for cardiovascular complications to arise and become a major concern.With the growing longevity of cancer patients, there is now a heightened concern regarding the cardiovascular complications associated with cancer treatments.Studies have revealed that subclinical cardiotoxicity caused by chemotherapy drugs affects up to 18% of patients, while clinical cardiotoxicity occurs in as many as 6% of cases. 3The emergence of cardiotoxicity as a side effect of chemotherapy drugs poses a new challenge in terms of clinical diagnosis and treatment. 3The purpose of this article is to summarize the possible mechanisms of cardiac toxicity caused by commonly used chemotherapy drugs and summarize the possible mechanisms of adverse cardiac toxicity, laying the groundwork for subsequent research.
## (s2) BVZ Induced Hypertension in a Dose-Dependent Manner
Number of References: 7

(p2.0) Various clinical trials have reported that the prevalence of BVZ-related hypertension ranges from 16% to 47%. 6,7Moreover, the frequency of hypertension was found to be influenced by the dosage of BVZ given. 8Individuals receiving a high dosage of BVZ experienced a more notable rise in blood pressure compared to those given a low dosage (see Figure 1).

(p2.1) Hypertension may arise due to the interaction between cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance.By inhibiting VEGF, BVZ has the potential to promote the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells and reduce the production of nitric oxide. 9,10These actions can cause the thickening of the blood vessel walls, narrowing of the vessel opening, decreased vasodilation capacity, and heightened vascular resistance.Consequently, these factors contribute to the development of hypertension.

(p2.2) BVZ Induced Elevation of Blood Pressure and Myocardial Ischemia Leading to Chronic Heart Failure Chronic heart failure (CHF) often occurs in conjunction with heightened blood pressure and myocardial ischemia caused by prolonged narrowing of blood vessels.Previous studies have indicated that the administration of BVZ can raise average arterial blood pressure during treatment. 6,7Sustained hypertension can lead to the enlargement of the heart muscle towards its center (myocardial centripetal hypertrophy), which can result in impaired function of the heart's ventricles during contraction and/or relaxation.
## (s7) Trastuzumab Triggers Heart Failure and May Trigger Cardiomyopathy

(p7.0) The aim of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of trastuzumab in breast cancer patients by conducting a critical Phase III clinical trial.The administration of trastuzumab yielded a noticeable improvement in the survival rate among the group of patients.However, it was observed that 27% of the patients who received trastuzumab developed heart failure, as mentioned in reference. 27Several important clinical trials have confirmed the significant role of trastuzumab in improving cancer patients' survival rates.Nonetheless, these trials have also established a link between trastuzumab and heart failure, as demonstrated by studies. 11,28Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that trastuzumab may contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy (see Figure 3).Trastuzumab disrupts the communication pathway between HER-2 and HER-4 heterodimers that is activated by neuregulin-I.This pathway is important for the proper functioning of cardiomyocytes and the repair of heart damage.Neuregulin-I has been shown to have protective effects on the heart through several mechanisms.These include promoting the survival, growth, and reproduction of cardiomyocytes, maintaining a balance in the effects of betaadrenergic signaling, regulating calcium levels, promoting angiogenesis, and encouraging the differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes.Disrupting these signals could potentially impair heart function and lead to heart failure. 29rastuzumab has been shown to decrease the levels of an anti-cell death protein called B-cell lymphoma-xl (Bcl-xl) and increase the levels of a pro-cell death protein called Bcl-xs.This mechanism leads to the breakdown of the protective membrane of mitochondria, disruption of electron transport, generation of harmful free radicals, and reduced production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), ultimately causing damage to heart muscle cells. 30Additionally, it's important to note that trastuzumab can affect the function of mitochondria by influencing downstream signaling pathways activated by HER-2, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular regulatory protein kinase (ERK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.Previous research has shown that damage and potential cell death can occur in myocardial microcells. 31n summary, trastuzumab disrupts the communication between HER-2 and HER-4 proteins, affecting the important neuregulin-I signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes.This disruption can hinder heart function, leading to heart failure.Trastuzumab also affects mitochondrial integrity and function, causing damage to heart muscle cells.These effects are mediated through various signaling pathways, including PI3K-AKT and ERK-MAPK.
