The Parker AC10 10G-44-0170-BF (7.5 kW, 17A, 3 × 400 V) inverter was loaded by a 7.5 kW induction motor equipped with hybrid bearings with ceramic rolling elements. Measurement of the motor shaft voltage uSH and shaft current iSH was ensured by using the shaft brush mounted on the motor frame [20]. The motor was loaded by an induction generator, and insulation between the motor and generator was performed by the installation of an insulated clutch. Star-connected capacitors Cd (3 × 680 pF) were used to measure a common-mode voltage uN_PE affecting motor windings. Additionally, a measurement of a phase voltage uC_PE referred to as the PE ground potential was also performed.

(p9.0) The laboratory setup for experimental tests is presented in Figure 19. The Parker AC10 10G-44-0170-BF (7.5 kW, 17A, 3 × 400 V) inverter was loaded by a 7.5 kW induction motor equipped with hybrid bearings with ceramic rolling elements. Measurement of the motor shaft voltage u SH and shaft current i SH was ensured by using the shaft brush mounted on the motor frame [20]. The motor was loaded by an induction generator, and insulation between the motor and generator was performed by the installation of an insulated clutch. Star-connected capacitors C d (3 × 680 pF) were used to measure a common-mode voltage u N_PE affecting motor windings. Additionally, a measurement of a phase voltage u C_PE referred to as the PE ground potential was also performed. The Tektronix DPO4034 oscilloscope equipped with the high-voltage differential probe P5205A (100 MHz) and the current probe TCP2020 (50 MHz) was used to record voltage and current waveforms. Tests were performed under two different cable lengths (1 m and 10 m) and different configurations of filters and chokes installed between the motor and inverter. Configurations with a 3.8 mH motor choke, a 0.72 mH CM choke, a 0.31 mH du/dt choke, a 3.8 mH/15 µF sine-wave filter and a 3.8 mH/15 µF sine-wave filter with a 0.72 mH CM choke were taken into account. From Equation (3), it can be derived that common-mode voltage uN_PE levels, as well as the duN_PE/dt gradient, are determined by phase voltages uA_PE, uB_PE and uC_PE referring to the PE ground potential. As a result, a reduction in gradient duN_PE/dt (which limits the leakage ground current iPE flowing in a PE protective ground wire) may be achieved by the limitation of derivatives duA_PE/dt, duC_PE/dt and duC_PE/dt. If no countermeasures were used, the value of derivative duC_PE/dt significantly exceeded 5 kV/µs regardless of the cable length (Table 2). It is worth mentioning that gradient duC_PE/dt is lower for a longer cable, which is caused by the additional inductances introduced between the motor and inverter by a longer cable. Application of the CM choke with the sine-wave filter results in the highest reduction in gradient duC_PE/dt (duC_PE/dt << 1 kV/us). A good effect (duC_PE/dt reduced to below 1.3 kV/us) is also noted when only the CM choke is used; however, the effectiveness of the CM choke decreases if the cable length increases. The sine-wave filter and the du/dt choke ensure a comparable level of du/dt reduction, with the duC_PE/dt value limited to 1.6 kV/us (Figure 20). When the motor choke was applied, the lowest level of du/dt gradient reduction was observed (duC_PE/dt reduced to 2.5 kV/us). From Equation (3), it can be derived that common-mode voltage u N_PE levels, as well as the du N_PE /dt gradient, are determined by phase voltages u A_PE , u B_PE and u C_PE referring to the PE ground potential. As a result, a reduction in gradient du N_PE /dt (which limits the leakage ground current i PE flowing in a PE protective ground wire) may be achieved by the limitation of derivatives du A_PE /dt, du C_PE /dt and du C_PE /dt. If no countermeasures were used, the value of derivative du C_PE /dt significantly exceeded 5 kV/µs regardless of the cable length (Table 2). It is worth mentioning that gradient du C_PE /dt is lower for a longer cable, which is caused by the additional inductances introduced between the motor and inverter by a longer cable. Application of the CM choke with the sine-wave filter results in the highest reduction in gradient du C_PE /dt (du C_PE /dt << 1 kV/us). A good effect (du C_PE /dt reduced to below 1.3 kV/us) is also noted when only the CM choke is used; however, the effectiveness of the CM choke decreases if the cable length increases. The sine-wave filter and the du/dt choke ensure a comparable level of du/dt reduction, with the du C_PE /dt value limited to 1.6 kV/us (Figure 20). When the motor choke was applied, the lowest level of du/dt gradient reduction was observed (du C_PE /dt reduced to 2.5 kV/us). Table 2. Common-mode impedance model parameters of a 7.5 kW motor with hybrid bearings 6308-2RS (ZCS Ceramit).   -mode impedance model parameters of a 7.5 kW motor with hybrid bearings 6308-2RS (ZCS Ceramit).  Besides the reduction in the du/dt gradient, an impact of the considered solutions on the uC_PE voltage spectrum is also perceptible. In comparison with other solutions, the most significant reduction (of about 25 dBµV) in the uC_PE voltage spectrum was noticed when the CM choke in a configuration with the sine-wave filter was applied ( Figure  21i,j). For this configuration, a spectrum limitation was achieved in a range of frequencies higher than 150 kHz regardless of the cable length. If only the CM choke is used, the spectrum is deteriorated due to the appearance of a peak at the frequency of 1.5 MHz, which is about 16 dBµV higher than the one noticed in the configuration with a single inverter (Figure 21g,h). For the rest of the considered solutions, the level of spectrum suppression is comparable.
