## (s3) Scope of Urban Bee Surveys
Number of References: 2

(p3.0) Urban bee surveys have been conducted in sites that varied according to, among other factors, density of development, remnant vegetation type, size or history of use. In this review we categorized the types of urban habitats surveyed based on broad descriptors to provide a context for evaluating trends in urban bee communities. In most of the surveys the authors classified habitats as "urban" without providing detailed descriptions. We note that although proximity to a built environment does constitute an urban setting, the term "urban" is general and does not allow for distinctions between habitats based on variation in ecologically significant characteristics. McIntyre et al. (2000) discussed the need for using quantitative descriptors when defining "urban" habitats. The use of an interdisciplinary concept of an urban habitat would promote comparison between urban ecological studies (McIntyre et al. 2000).
