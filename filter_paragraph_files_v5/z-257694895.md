(p1.0) RES (3, 5, 4 0 -trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenol that can be found in grape skins, plums, peanuts, bilberries, and dark chocolate. RES is one of the most effective components of grape juice [26]. This phytoalexin was first elicited in the medical herbal white hellebore. Subsequently, it was detected in the polygonum cuspidatum, which was used in Chinese herbal medicine as an anti-inflammatory and antifungal agent. RES can exist in geometric arrangements (cis/trans) isomerism from, being trans-form the most therapeutic applications [27]. It can be changed into the cis-form upon exposure to UV radiation (ultraviolet) [28]. Experiments have indicated that RES is very well endured by experimental models with no serious effects. The orally administered RES in rats and dogs (with respective doses of 200 and 600 mg/kg/day) for 90 days led to no obvious side effects [29]. Besides, the RES dosage of 450 mg/day is safe for a 60-kg normal person [30]. Despite the numerous human and animal studies that emphasised the effective and protective properties of RES [31][32][33], limited number of clinical works have addressed the adverse effects of RES.

(p1.1) However, the high efficacy in biologically positive effects of RES elevates the level of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduces ROS [34]. Moreover, it has been reported that RES has different therapeutic efficacies, like modulation of many cell-signalling pathways [35], antioxidant, anti-ageing attributes [36], anti-inflammatory, anticancer [37], and neuroprotective (such as AD and PD) [38]. Studies have shown that RES as a polyphenolic stilbene supplement is involved in various pathophysiological functions of AD [39,40]. According to the chemical and physical properties and the mechanism of its interaction with extracellular and intracellular molecules, RES has anti-amyloidogenic properties and can be promising against neuroinflammation and inhibition of AD [41].
