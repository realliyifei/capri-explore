## (s5) BK Polyomavirus (BKPyV)
Number of References: 27

(p5.0) Human Polyoma Virus 1, more commonly known as BK polyoma virus (BKPyV) after the initials of the first affected patient, is a member of the polyomaviridae family. It is a non-enveloped virus with a double-stranded DNA genome [39]. Like CMV, it is a relatively ubiquitous pathogen, with more than 90% of the population acquiring primary infection in childhood [40]. This virus has a tropism for the urological system and remains latent in the renal tubular epithelium and urothelium [41]. Clinically significant reactivation occurs almost exclusively in the immunocompromised [39], namely, in renal transplant patients who may develop polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PyVAN) and in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients who may develop polyomavirusassociated haemorrhagic cystitis (PyVHC). In contrast, only minority of immunocompetent hosts develop asymptomatic viruria. BKPyV is also implicated in other organ systems, presenting as encephalitis, meningitis, pneumonia, retinitis, colitis, and vasculitis [39,42], amongst other manifestations such as upper respiratory disease and tonsillitis [43]. PCR is most often used for diagnosis of BKPyV, followed by viral culture and serology [39].

(p5.1) Histologically, BKPyVAN progresses from an early state of viral cytopathic effect and acute tubular injury (pattern A) to interstitial nephritis (pattern B) and finally to severe interstitial fibrosis (pattern C) [44]. Viral cytopathic effect is typified by renal tubular cells with enlarged nuclei with glassy basophilic nuclear inclusions [39]. This can be confirmed via immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against Simian polyomavirus SV40, which cross-react with BKPyV. As BKPyVAN is a significant cause of allograft failure, early recognition of the disease process is key to improving patient outcomes. The mainstay of treatment is to reduce immunosuppression which can be achieved by reducing drug dose, stopping or switching drugs [41].

(p5.2) In the bladder, urothelial cells infected by BKPyV similarly show enlarged nuclei with glassy basophilic nuclear inclusions and are termed 'decoy cells', ( Figure 2E) as they may be mistaken for malignant urothelial cells ( Figure 2F) on cytologic preparations. Absence of other cytologic features of malignancy, such as coarse chromatin and irregular nuclear contours as well as correlation with the clinical and cystoscopic findings are pertinent considerations in distinguishing decoy cells from malignant urothelial cells [45]. Although BKPyV can be detected in urine cytology, urine PCR has been reported to have higher sensitivity and specificity compared to cytology [46]. Other methods of BKPyV detection also include immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy [47].

(p5.3) In a study of 240 urine cytology specimens from 80 renal transplant recipients [48], decoy cells were identified in 37.5% and has been proposed as a routine screening method for viral infections in renal transplant patients. This is further supported by another study of 13 patients with BKPyV found in urine that reported a positive predictive value for polyomavirus disease of 90% [49].

(p5.4) The relationship between BKPyV with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus [42] and malignancy is controversial and the pathogenesis is thought to be independent of active viral replication [41]. BKPyV has been shown to induce the transformation of normal cells into malignant cells, partly attributed to the expression of major Tumour-Antigen and minor Tumour-Antigen [39]. In a study investigating the association between BKPyV DNA, mRNA, and cancers, including renal cell carcinoma and bladder transitional cell carcinoma [50], there was a significant association between the presence of BKPyV DNA and renal cell carcinoma, with an increase in risk of developing renal cell carcinoma in patients infected with BKPyV. Other studies have reported an association between BKPyV and urothelial carcinoma in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients [40,51]. BKPyV is also associated with prostatic carcinoma [51][52][53]. However, several studies have reported a lack of association between BKPyV and urothelial carcinoma, where one study reported a lack of BKPyV DNA sequences in transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder [54] and another retrospective study of 37 cases of urothelial carcinomas did not show evidence of BKPyV on immunohistochemistry and chromogenic in situ hybridisation [55]. Further studies are warranted in this area.
## (s6) Adenovirus, Measles Virus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
Number of References: 10

(p6.0) Adenovirus, a non-enveloped icosahedral virus with a DNA-protein core complex [56], is subdivided into multiple subgroups ranging from subgroup A to F, each made up of different serotypes and having a predilection for specific organs including the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urinary tracts [57]. Subclinical infections often occur in immunocompetent hosts and clinically significant manifestations include upper and lower respiratory tract disease, conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and cystitis [56]. Adenovirus can be detected in conjunctival scrapings, nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and stool samples via PCR, cell culture, and antigen detection by immunofluorescence [58,59]. Viral cytopathic changes associated with adenovirus can mimic malignancy in cytology specimens including pleural fluid [60] and urine samples [61], and these changes typically include enlarged nuclei with basophilic intranuclear inclusions surrounded by a thin rim of cytoplasm [60], also termed 'smudge cells' [17]. Adenovirus infection is often managed supportively although antivirals such as cidofovir and ribavirin have been explored in the treatment [56].
## (s7) Granulomatous Inflammation
Number of References: 32

(p7.0) Granulomatous inflammation is defined by the presence of granulomas, which refer to aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes ( Figure 2G) [71]. Granulomatous inflammation has been extensively discussed in previously published reviews [17,[71][72][73]. Several patterns of granulomatous inflammation have been described, and they include foreign body type reaction, necrotising (with central necrotic material) granulomas, and non-necrotising granulomas [71]. Different patterns of granulomatous inflammation are associated with different aetiologies. Foreign body type reaction is often associated with suture material in excision or resection specimens, as well as other foreign materials such as talc and starch [71]. Necrotising granulomas are associated with infectious pathogens including mycobacterium tuberculosis and fungal organisms [17,71], while the differential diagnoses of non-necrotising granulomas encompass both infectious and non-infectious causes including sarcoidosis [74], Crohn's disease [75], toxic and drug causes [71]. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain ( Figure 2H) is often used clinically to identify acid-fast bacilli in respiratory specimens including sputum, with a specificity ranging from 90% to 100%, albeit with a limited sensitivity [17].

(p7.1) The presence of granulomas associated with tumours is well established, reportedly seen in 4.4% of carcinomas, 13.8% of Hodgkin's disease, 7.3% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas [76], and 50.0% of seminomas [77,78]. Distinguishing between a granulomatous inflammation and malignancy has proven to be difficult on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) [78], where a study of six cases of neck mass FNAC reported that only one case was diagnosed as metastatic carcinoma with extensive granulomatous inflammation while the remaining cases were signed out as "atypical" with a recommendation for tissue biopsy [78]. The histopathological diagnoses of the remaining cases included Hodgkin's disease, lymphoepithelial carcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic carcinoma [78]. In a subsequent study of 153 patients undergoing endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal lymphadenopathy which met radiological criteria for cancer recurrence, 11.0% showed non-caseating granulomas on cytology [79]. Granulomatous inflammation also occurs after intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for bladder carcinoma [80].

(p7.2) In particular, granulomatous mastitis, a granulomatous inflammation of breast parenchymal tissue, although uncommonly encountered, can be mistaken for a malignancy, both clinically and radiologically [81]. A series of three studies of patients with granulomatous mastitis reported a mean age of 34 to 44 years [81][82][83]. In one of these studies, tuberculous infection accounted for most cases of granulomatous mastitis, followed by foreign body and idiopathic aetiologies [82]. Of these three studies, one was a series of 16 patients which reported clinical impression of a breast abscess in half the patients [81], whereas another series of 18 cases [83] reported a clinical impression of a malignant lesion in all cases. The most common ultrasonography finding in these studies was a heterogeneous hypoechoic lesion [82]. Cytologic and histological findings were characteristic for granulomas, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, but differed in the presence or absence of necrosis [82]. An early, limited case series of five patients with granulomatous mastitis [84] reported atypia or 'suspicious for malignancy' on FNAC in three cases. However, the authors did not specify the criteria used for a cytologic impression of an 'atypical' lesion. There is now a trend towards performing core needle biopsy over FNAC in sampling breast lesions [85], thereby improving diagnostic accuracy by histopathology rather than cytology.
## (s10) Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
Number of References: 2

(p10.0) Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a member of the Papovaviridae family. It is a nonenveloped DNA virus with a predilection for cutaneous and mucosal epithelium. More than 90% of people who acquire the virus experience transient infection and can immunologically clear the virus. In contrast, chronic persistent infection, contributed to by various factors such as immunocompromise, frequent reinfections and co-infections, is associated with progression to neoplasia [93]. HIV status was reported to be associated with higher prevalence of HPV infection [94].

## (s17) Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV)
Number of References: 26

(p17.0) MCPyV belongs to the family of human polyomaviruses, along with BKPyV. It is a recently identified virus implicated in the pathogenesis of merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), where the genomic sequences of MCPyV were detected in 80.0% of MCC [12]. It is a double-stranded DNA virus, with an early coding region that expresses three T antigens including large T antigen (LT) and small T antigen (ST) [136][137][138]. Although MCPyV can be found in the skin of the healthy population, most do not develop MCC [137]. The prevalence of MCPyV in MCC is variable depending on the region of interest, with 88.5% of MCC in Japanese patients [139], up to 76.0% in the United States population [140], and 66.6% in Swiss patients [141] found to be positive for MCPyV DNA. In a study of 37 MCC in patients from North America and Australia [142], it was reported that 69.0% of North American patients with MCC were positive for MCPyV DNA, compared to only 24.0% of the Australian patients. The authors postulated that increased sun exposure in Australia may have made viral aetiology a less frequent contributing factor [142]. Aside from MCPyV, ultraviolet exposure and immune deficiencies are also risk factors for the development of MCC [137], with higher prevalence of MCPyV reported in individuals with HIV [143]. A meta-analysis of 22 studies reported a pooled risk ratio of 6.32 for MCC associated with MCPyV although there was also a non-negligible proportion of controls with MCPyV [144]. Clinically, MCC may present like other skin neoplasms, as a rapidly growing skin nodule in sun-damaged skin or may also present as metastatic disease [137].

(p17.1) The pathogenesis of MCC were previously elaborated in greater details [136,137,145,146]. Becker et al. [137] outlined the key pathogenic mechanisms, which are initiated either by "the clonal integration of the MCPyV genome or ultraviolet (UV)-mediated DNA damage caused by chronic exposure to sunlight". Key mechanisms involved in the development of MCC include the expression of LT and ST proteins, RB1 and TP53 pathways, and UVinduced DNA mutations, although these mechanisms differ depending on the presence of MCPyV [137].

(p17.2) Histologically, the tumour is located in the dermis and/or subcutis, with cell size ranging from small to large, and the nuclei showing the characteristic salt-and-pepper chromatin seen in neuroendocrine neoplasms as well as nuclear moulding ( Figure 4G,H) [147]. Brisk mitotic activity is often present. On immunohistochemistry, the cells are positive for epithelial markers including CAM 5.2, AE1/3, and CK20, as well as neuroendocrine markers including synaptophysin [137]. A negative TTF-1 differentiates it from a metastatic small cell carcinoma [148]. The MCPyV T antigens can also be highlighted on immunohistochemistry [137].

(p17.3) The management of MCC includes wide local excision, assessment of regional lymph nodes with a consideration for sentinel lymph node biopsy if clinically indicated, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, with promising results reported in clinical trials investigating the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapies such as pembrolizumab [137]. Therapeutic vaccines remain a field that is worth exploring in MCC associated with MCPyV [149].
## (s19) Opisthorcis Viverrine (Ov) and Clonorchis Sinensis (Cs)
Number of References: 8

(p19.0) Ov and Cs are liver flukes, members of the Opisthorchiidae family [157]. Os is prevalent in South East Asia [158], including countries like Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia [159], while Cs is prevalent in East Asia, affecting mainly China, Korea, East Russia, Taiwan, and Vietnam [157]. The tradition of consuming raw fish has accounted for most liver fluke infections in Thailand [158]. Humans are host to Ov, among other hosts, including fresh water intermediate hosts and domesticated cats and dogs [160]. In the infected host, the Ov metacercaria excyst in the duodenum, and ascend into the biliary ducts where they develop to adult worms which then reside in the biliary system of the host [158]. Cs requires three different hosts for its life cycle (snails, fish, and mammals), with similar pattern of migration to biliary epithelium as Ov [157].
