(p2.0) Sea-level rise is the greatest potential threat of climate change that not only will affect millions of people but also mangrove ecosystems [22]. Recent study using Coastal DEM indicates that under high emissions, 630 million people will be living on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100 [23]. This study also reports that 70% of the total people worldwide living in China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan, would be exposed to sea-level rise and annual storm surges [23].

(p2.1) Sea-level rise will affect salinity that surpasses their tolerance threshold and inundation duration and frequency [3], [22]. As mangroves are halophytes, salinity changes could impact propagules growth and alter the species composition [3].Studies have reported the increase of coastal flooding in the future due to sea-level rise which are likely to increase by 0.28 and 0.98 m by 2100 [24]. Increases in inundation due to long term flooding may also lead to plant death and species composition shifts [3], [20]. Sea-level rise will lead to a gradual decline for some mangrove areas, survival of individual trees to local extirpation [20].
## (s5) Storms

(p5.0) Storms and extreme weather events have been predicted to increase in intensity and frequency [24]. The impact of storms is proportional to their strength, frequency, size and duration. Hurricanes and cyclones can impact mangroves by uprooting trees, breaking branches and defoliating their canopy [22]. Extreme storms can lead to complete large-scale mangrove mortality and increase stress due to peat collapse and rapid decreases in soil elevation [30]. Mangrove sediment elevation could be altered by storms through soil erosion, soil deposition, peat collapse, and soil compression [30], [20]. Mass mangrove mortality with little survival of saplings and tress could lead to permanent ecosystem conversion as recovery that might be hindered due to sediment elevation and hydrology changes [30].
