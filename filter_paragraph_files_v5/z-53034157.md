(p0.0) Knowledge created through application of the scientific method requires effort to translate into action. This process, which involves identifying who (e.g. healthcare providers, public health professionals, government decision-makers) potential knowledge users might be and how they might be involved in the process, is referred to as knowledge translation (KT). A commonly cited definition of KT is "a dynamic and iterative process that includes synthesis, dissemination, exchange and ethically-sound application of knowledge to improve health, provide more effective health services and products, and strengthen the health care system" [1]. The science of KT has developed significantly over the past two decades in response to growing demand for ensuring research findings are used to inform decision-making in clinical, organisational and policy contexts [2]. Theoretical frameworks exist that help to explain the knowledge-to-action process [3,4] and applied research has been performed to understand the most effective ways to achieve desired KT outcomes in public health [5], healthcare [6,7] and public policy [8].

(p0.1) A key part of KT that has been studied is knowledge synthesis or "the contextualization and integration of research findings of individual research studies within the larger body of knowledge on the topic" [1]. Although most syntheses will proceed through similar stages (e.g. form review team, formulate question, search and screen evidence, etc.), specific methods and data will be used depending on the research questions and intended use [9,10]. For example, aggregative reviews may collect and combine quantitative data from primary studies in order to test hypotheses and make cause and effect statements about intervention effectiveness (i.e. what is the effect of X on Y?) [10]. Configurative reviews may collect, organise and interpret different types of data (qualitative, quantitative) in order to answer questions that help understand experiences and meanings, and generate theory about the world (i.e. what do we know about X and Y?) [10]. Realist reviews may aggregate and configure data to offer explanations about how an intervention works in particular contexts (i.e. what works for whom, in what circumstances, in what respects and how?) [10,11]. Realist reviews, in particular, can be used by decision-makers to gain deep understanding about complex social interventions that can be used when planning and implementing national, regional or local level programmes [11]. To do so, realist approaches focus on understanding the contexts (i.e. circumstances that surround the implementation of a given intervention or phenomena), mechanisms (i.e. underlying processes that are sensitive to context and influence outcomes) and outcomes (i.e. effects that occur over time) [11][12][13][14]. Context, mechanism and outcome (CMO) configurations explain how specific actions interact with context, which in turn activate specific mechanisms and lead to specific outcomes.

(p9.0) Of the four papers reviewed in-depth, two were realist reviews, one was a protocol for a realist review, and another focussed on describing rapid realist reviews (i.e. a realist approach to knowledge synthesis that emphasises producing a time-sensitive product responsive to policy-makers' information needs). Specific types of KT activities identified in the papers included healthcare planning frameworks and tools to support decisionmakers [40,41], publications for academic and lay audiences [41], conference presentations [41], tailored workshops and presentations for knowledge users (e.g. policy-makers) [41,42], and knowledge brokering to understand policy and academic perspectives and develop recommendations that are sensitive to local contexts [43]. Consistent with realist methodology, each paper described knowledge user engagement throughout the review process. The included papers articulated the aim of the KT strategy in different ways. Two papers indicated that their KT efforts would help them achieve goals related to the purpose of the research [41,43]. One paper was more specific in how their findings would be used, stating that findings would inform the development of a new intervention [40]. The methodological paper identified several practical considerations for enabling KT for realist reviews such as engaging knowledge users with demanding time constraints (e.g. agency or government staff) in a reference group rather than an active member of the synthesis team [43]. Data extraction from the four papers is available in Additional file 1.
