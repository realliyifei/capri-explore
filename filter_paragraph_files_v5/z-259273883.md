(p19.0) The interventions were not always successful in reducing the pharmacological burden or improving its quality.In fact, in five studies, there was no difference in medication use between the exposed and non-exposed groups. 24,27,28,33,34In one study, 35 the number of medications used increased (although the increase was more pronounced among the control group), and in one study, 32 it was not possible to conclude about medication use.As a result, less than half of the articles (5/12, 41%) 25,26,[29][30][31] reported a positive impact in the intervention group with regards to pharmacotherapy.This was reflected in a reduction in the total number of medications, 31 the number of Fall-Risk-Increasing-Drugs (FRIDs) medications, 25 the number of potentially inappropriate medications 26,30 or the number of drug-related problems. 29However, most studies provided minimal information on the medication deprescribed.For instance, specific groups of potentially inappropriate medications were not clearly described, and only four studies presented the classes of medications that were reduced or changed (stopped/substituted/started or dose changed), such as vitamins and minerals, antihypertensive, sedative or gastro-intestinal agents. 25,26,30,34Therefore, no specific conclusions could be drawn about the medications that were deprescribed in the studies.

(p19.1) Extracting information on deprescribed medications was a challenge, as many interventions included actions beyond deprescribing.Only two trials primarily focused on reducing the number of medications, specifically targeting medications on the FRIDs list 25 and anticholinergic/sedative medications to reduce the drug burden index (DBI). 34In the other studies, medication reviews took place as part of larger pharmaceutical care interventions, which involved not only stopping medications but also

(p20.0) No study was designed to investigate mortality as the main outcome.Only four studies included mortality as a secondary or safety outcome. 26,31,32,34Therefore, the studies were not designed to be adequately powered to detect clinically significant differences between the groups regarding mortality, and the number of events was low.In all eight other trials, mortality was only reported descriptively (often in the flowchart without additional information) and without measures of association-let alone adjustment for confounding factors.As a result, mortality data were most often provided similarly to data on people lost to follow-up or those who withdrew consent.The individuals who died were excluded from the medication analysis, except in the study by Hanlon et al., which included the data using the last information caried forward method. 28Baseline characteristics of those who died, the timing of their death in relation to the intervention, medication use patterns or other details relevant for appreciating the association between the intervention and mortality were absent from most trials.Nonetheless, Campins et al. reported that deaths in the intervention group were not related to medication changes in their study. 26verall, the studies included relatively small samples and had short follow-up periods.The total number of randomized participants varied between 25 27 and 1188, 35 with five studies having total sample sizes of â‰¤150. 27,29,31,33,34Follow-up was less than 1 year in three studies (5 weeks, 27 3 months, 34 6 months 29,31 ), 1 year in seven studies [24][25][26]28,30,33,35 and 2 years in one study. 32 This shot follow-up makes it difficult to accurately assess mortality risk. Futhermore, since the studies were not specifically designed to measure mortality, important confounding factors, such as frailty, cognitive status, autonomy and level of dependency, were not thoroughly evaluated.Due to the small sample sizes, there is a high risk of an imbalanced distribution of these factors between the intervention and control groups at randomization-a phenomenon that was observed with other variables, albeit limited.26,28,30,33,34 In the study by Lampela et al., 30 17 deaths occurred in the intervention group and 38 in the control group before the start of the intervention/ equivalent evaluation, which illustrates that mortality risk could have been imbalanced between groups.
