(p0.0) The main target in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is to find the shape or the underlying structure of shapes in data. In its recent contribution, TDA is often considered to deal with a huge number of discrete points in high-dimensional space., i.e., a data cloud. A simple way to show that how a large number of data points can represent the whole space is to construct the Voronoi Diagram [1]. Voronoi diagram partitions the space to convex sub-regions (e.g., polygons, polyhedrons, etc) and each sub-region covers the area in which a site (i.e., a particular data point) is the closest data point. TDA methods usually introduce a similar intuition, but follow more complex methodologies. While the geometry (as offered by Voronoi Diagrams) depends on distances to study shapes, topology benefits from homeomorphisms that are closed with respect to stretching or shrinking. Therefore, TDA methods are much less sensitive to the choice of metric [2]. This will allow us to use TDA for a wide family of problems in which the shape of data matters. We will follow some recent developments in TDA and will focus on a widely used topological tool called Persistent Homology.

(p3.0) Skraba et al. in [25] showed that persistent homology can be used in time delay embedding models. Time delay embeddings translate a 1-dimensional time series to a d-dimensional time series in which the current value at each time with (d âˆ’ 1) lags coordinate [26,27]. Skraba et al. developed a framework of analyzing dynamic systems based on topological data analysis that requires almost no prior information of the underlying structure. Instead, a discrete sample of data point is being studied in periodic, quasi-periodic and recurrent systems. The same approach have been considered frequently in the later works on different applications of time series. The authors suggested that clustering d-dimensional delay embedding of a time series in some subspaces of R d can easily reveal recurrent nature of the system on appeared loops and returning paths. The next step is to utilize persistent homology or more precisely the persistence diagram or Betti numbers to measure these loops. Note that these loops in delay-coordinate embedding do not necessarily exist in the samples of the initial time-series. This is one of the reasons that the authors preferred to work on delay embedding R d field. In addition, tuning the time delay parameter will result in a more robust model. Based on Vietoris-Rips or any similar filtration, one can construct the persistence diagram of the delay embedding.
