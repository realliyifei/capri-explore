(p3.0) In convolution-based filtering (3), we suppose that measurements z n are available on a time horizon of N points (memory b ), from time m = n − N + 1 to time n, that the estimator is causal, and that m 0. In order to findx n+p in state space, the batch p-shift UFIR estimator [8,20] can be applied. For TV models, the p-shift UFIR estimator was derived in [8], assuming that the negative shift p is no smaller than −N + 1. Below, we modify this estimator for arbitrary p, which is needed for one of the smoother forms.

(p3.1) Let p = −N + 1 and consider the estimate (eq. (21)) of [19]) at the initial point m that gives uŝ
