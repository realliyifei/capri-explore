(p3.0) Most studies did not use usual validation methods to test the performance of the predicting models across multiple courses. [10,13] Nonetheless, 10 cross fold-validation was used in two studies. [10] 10 cross fold-validation is a split sample technique (divides dataset it into 10 equal parts, and uses nine parts as a training dataset and one as a test). [10,16] In summary, evidence is growing toward individualizing prediction models for each context and against using a one size fits all prediction model. [13]
