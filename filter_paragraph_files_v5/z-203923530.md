## (s4) Reviews on Studies About Food Choice and Nutrition in Adolescents or Young Adults

(p4.0) Adolescence is a time when food behaviours consolidate and have the tendency to track into adulthood [46]. About one third of the retained studies focused on adolescents or young adults. One review [23] reported on the use of social media as a complementary component of larger nutrition interventions and highlighted its potential benefit for short-term changes in behaviour. Hsu et al. [25] underscored behaviour change techniques among adolescents including social media. Interestingly, improvements in two key healthy eating behaviours, namely increased fruit and vegetable intake and reduction in sugar sweetened beverages, were achieved after the application of techniques such as goal setting, getting social support or demonstration activities. Adolescents welcome initiatives to help them make healthier choices, according to some of the reviews reported by Bauer and Reitsch [38].

(p4.1) Menu labelling could be effective in helping children and adolescents in reducing energy purchased and energy intake as demonstrated in artificial/lab settings, however, findings from controlled settings are difficult to replicate in real-life scenarios [45]. Contextual labels (e.g., traffic lights) seem to be more efficient in supporting healthier choices [24].

(p4.2) Powell [30] suggested that healthy foods should be made as convenient, practical, and interesting as possible for young consumers; interesting foods (designed by FF chains & promoted as specials) give a sense of adventure for young males but leaves them vulnerable to unhealthy or unsustainable food choices. Social support, whether from peers or family members, can have both positive or adverse effects on dietary behaviours and eventual onset of overweight/obesity. Family members and sharing meals with the larger family was associated with better eating habits in early adolescence, but not in older ages [26,47]. Particularly, the presence of grandparents at home might contribute to a healthier weight status among mobile/migrated families but not in societies with little geographic mobility [22].
