(p18.0) Data application is a presentation aspect of digital preservation.Digital presentation of architectural heritage affects value interpretation, virtual-real interaction, simulation and dynamic preservation.To better present architectural heritage, several researchers have constructed different technological tools.For example, Bugalia et al. [93] propose a mixed reality (MR) based interactive system that combines computer graphics and VR technologies for real-time monitoring of architectural heritage, which allows users to experience and interact with cultural heritage.Stroscio et al. [94] create thematic maps and analyze data on the properties and decay forms of building material loss to monitor material degradation, building loss and restoration information; the thematic maps also allow Stroscio et al. to query damage information in a parametric way.

(p18.1) As research in architectural heritage preservation gradually moves towards high fidelity and dynamic digital models, digital twin technology also shows great potential within this field.Francoe et al. [95] established a digital twin system through photogrammetry to build a digital preservation system for architectural heritage with databases, meta-universes, VR and gamification methods; as they have suggested their digital twin system should enhance users' auditory and visual experiences and can improve the perception of architectural heritage preservation.Ma et al. [96] took Taiwan's historical buildings as an example and applied the Unity3D platform to build an interactive old city neighborhood information model, which provides dynamic VR simulation of interactive buildings and environments.These technological tools not only enrich the presentation and content of architectural heritage, but also increase public participation and awareness of architectural heritage.
