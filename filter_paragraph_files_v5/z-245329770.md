(p5.0) Most of the envisioned IoBNT applications require a bidirectional nano-macro interface that can seamlessly connect the intrabody nanonetworks to the external macroscale networks, and vice versa [114], [115]. Considering that the MC is the most promising method for intrabody IoBNT, the interface should be capable of performing the conversion between biochemical signals and other signal forms that can be easily processed and communicated over conventional networks, such as electromagnetic, electrical, and optical. Several techniques are considered for enabling such a nano-macro interface.

(p5.1) 1) Electrical Interfaces: These are the devices that can transduce molecular signals into electrical signals, and vice versa. Electrical biosensors can readily serve the function of converting MC signals into electrical signals (see Section III-A1 for the use of electrical biosensors as MC receivers). The literature on biosensors is vast, and the first practical demonstration of graphene bioFET-based MC receiver shows promising results in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and reliability in electrical detection of MC signals [72]. However, challenges posed by physiological conditions should be overcome before employing biosensors as electrical interfaces, as detailed in [55], [13]. Conversion from electrical signals into molecular signals is more challenging due to the problem of maintaining continuous molecule generation or supply. Existing electrical stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems rely on limited-capacity reservoirs or polymer chains, e.g., hydrogel, that can store certain types of molecules and release them upon stimulation with a modulated rate. However, these systems are typical irreversible, i.e., they cannot replenish their molecular stock unless they are replaced or reloaded externally [13].
