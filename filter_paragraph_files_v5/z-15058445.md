(p0.0) Nervous system disorders continue to challenge the medical genomics of rare Mendelian mutation identification. Two examples in which exome sequencing has proven successful are the new neuroectodermal CHIME (C oloboma, H eart defects, Ichthyosiform dermatosis, Mental retardation, Ear anomalies with hearing loss) syndrome that is "presumed to be an autosomal recessive disorder because of recurrence in sibs" [26], and the Joubert syndrome, a disorder in which, for the majority of subjects, "the causal mutations have not yet been identified…" [27]. The recent 2015 French Canadian population study that utilized a combined targeted and exome sequencing approach successfully identified two non-French Canadian subjects with the CEP104 mutations of Joubert syndrome and demonstrated a 94% (n=43) prevalence of CEP104 disruption as conclusive evidence of causation "despite substantial locus and allelic [population] heterogeneity" [28].

(p0.1) Kohlschutter-Tonz syndrome is another example in which researchers are using exome sequencing to shed light on disorders for which "the molecular basis has not yet been elucidated" [29]. Such is also the case regarding what researchers described as "a new lethal autonomic sensory neuropathy" [30] and the incompletely understood brain malformation disorder Baraitser-Winter syndrome [31].

(p0.2) We find an ambitious application of exome sequencing in the molecular research area dedicated to mental retardation. A letter published by Nature Genetics focused on researchers' assertion that "de novo mutations may compensate for allele loss due to severely reduced fecundity in common neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases, explaining a major paradox in evolutionary genetic theory" [32]. Based on exome sequencing -based application of their theory, the investigators further claimed that "together with de novo copy number variation, de novo point mutations of large effect could explain the majority of all mental retardation cases in the population" [32].
## (s2) Musculoskeletal

(p2.0) Musculoskeletal disorders (MS) affect up to 33% of adults in the United States [35]. The tendency of these disorders to worsen with age, combined with the significant number of citizens approaching geriatric age, indicates that we can reasonably expect a statistical escalation in the near future. By exposing previously unidentified therapeutic targets in MS disorders such as Osteogenesis imperfecta [36], Skeletal Dysplasia [37], and Primary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy [38], deciphering of the exome sequencing has a promising role in the development of new treatment modalities. Researchers asserted the utility of exome sequencing in "the diagnostic algorithm for infants presenting with congenital dislocations, chondrodysplasia, and short stature" [39]. Exome sequencing may prove equally valuable in early screening for heritable, but poorly understood, conditions such as metachondromatosis [40], Hajdu-Cheney [41], Early Onset Generalized Dystonia [42], Distal Arthrogryposis Type 1 [43], and Nager syndrome [44].

(p2.1) Researchers from the Kennerson study on CMT type 6 confirmed that muscularly, MRI results revealed lower extremity distal muscle fatty infiltrates and that the majority of the infiltrates noted were in the soleus muscles, with lesser fatty deposition in the tibialis anterior muscles. The latter study's authors concluded that the finding "differs from demyelinating CMT1A patients and is similar to axonal CMT2A patients" [24]. Autosomal dominant distal neuromuscular disease research on HSPB8 mutations as the causal factor that resulted in myofibrillar aggregates and rimmed vacuolar myopathy combined with neurogenic changes revealed by MRI that the lower limb diffuse tissue alterations in the early disease stages eventually progressed in later stages to myopathy with a typical fatty deposition [45].
## (s3) Genetic targets related to developmental delay
Number of References: 8

(p3.0) Successful identification of the Schinzel-Gideon syndrome allele underscores the idea that, while "Protein coding genes constitute only approximately 1% of the human genome but harbor 85% of the mutations" [46], they need not remain unidentified. Developmental delay -related genetic targets such as non-syndromic mental retardation [47], mental retardation [32] and sporadic autism spectrum disorders characterize novel candidates for identification by whole exome sequencing, even when complicated by consanguinity [48] and de novo occurrences [49]. It is not uncommon for diseases seemingly unrelated by signs, symptoms or phenotype to share a common molecular mechanism or pathway. Examples are the monogenic comorbidities of the neurodevelopmental disorder autism such as Rett Syndrome and Fragile X [50,51]. It was especially useful however, to find common genes connecting cancer and autism. Specifically, TSC2, NF1, and TSC1 gene mutations intensify the cancer predisposition in autism patients. Moreover, because common genomic pathways suggest common treatment targets, exome sequencing empowers drug research with a multifaceted approach. Since exome sequencing, together with genome-wide-association studies and other modalities have recently uncovered the polygenic nature of autism [52], this leaves wide open the possibility of therapeutic advances in several diseases.

(p3.1) Whole exome sequencing has begun to gain utility as an affordable clinical biomarker. A study of 50 patients at the Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen concluded that WES "has a higher yield and lower costs to provide a diagnosis in child presumed to have a genetic origin of their disease" [53]. The margin of savings was not trivial, reported cost for WES € 3,600 compared to €12,241 for the non-WES care. A neurogenetics clinic went further by conducting a retrospective cohort study on patients with neurodevelopmental disabilities whose non-WES evaluations had yielded unactionable or inconclusive results. Presentations, new WES -informed diagnoses and subsequent changes in treatment plans were tracked for the 78 patients. The investigators concluded that "the high diagnostic yield of WES supports its use in pediatric neurology practices. It may also lead to earlier diagnosis, impacting medical management, prognostication, and family planning. WES therefore serves as a critical tool for the child neurologist" [54].
