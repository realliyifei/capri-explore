(p0.0) Impairment of upper extremity motor function is a common complication after stroke, and it occurs in approximately 85% of early stage patients 1) . In particular, permanent impairment of upper extremity motor function was reported in more than 50% of stroke survivors 2) and most recovery for motor and functional movement in stroke occurs in the first 3 months after the onset of stroke 3) . Thus, active therapeutic intervention for recovery of motor function in early stages of stroke is essential 4,5) . According to a previous study, repetitive therapeutic program induces rearrangement of the cerebral cortex and neuroplasticity, which contribute to recovery of functional movements [6][7][8] . Thus, in stoke rehabilitation, physical and occupational therapists provide manipulation and therapeutic exercises consisting of repetitive training. However, it is difficult to control the quantity of the appropriate treatment only by the subjective judgment of the therapists.

(p0.1) In recent years, robotic device has been used as a therapeutic intervention to improve functional movement of stroke patients 9) . The use of robotic device in stroke rehabilitation minimizes the physical burden of therapists, and not only enables repetitive therapy with high intensity but also provides diversity in the patterns of therapy using only a simple manipulation. With these features, robot-assisted therapy is possible to provide a quantitative and objective treatment to the patients 10) . Furthermore, robot-assisted therapy is more effective in providing motivation and an active exercise than traditional therapy 9,10) . Therapeutic robots currently are being actively used in stroke rehabilitation 11) , especially as an effective intervention for enhancing upper extremity function 12) . This way, current technical advantages not only provide safety to stroke patients, but also are leading the development of robot-assisted rehabilitation for intensive rehabilitation 10) . Because a large portion of the recovery in stroke occurs in the acute and subacute stage, robot-assisted therapy is being actively performed in acute-and subacute-stage patients 13) . However, the effects of robot-assisted rehabilitation therapy for upper extremity are analyzed differently according to the type of robots. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically investigate the effects of robot-assisted rehabilitation on the upper extremity in patients with acute and subacute stroke.

(p2.0) A quality evaluation of the 6 journal articles finally selected was performed using the PEDro scale. Scores ranged from 7 to 10, so the quality of the articles was high, with an average score of 7.66 (Table 1). There was one study comparing robot-assisted therapy and conventional therapy 14) , and the remaining 5 studies combined robot-assisted therapy with general or conventional therapies as the intervention method [15][16][17][18][19] . The intervention time ranged from 30 to 180 minutes per day, and the time allotted for upper extremity robot-assisted therapy was 30-40 minutes. Therapy was performed 3-7 days per week ( Table 2). The subjects enrolled in the 6 selected studies were older adults, with an average age of 66 years, and there were 278 early stage (acute and subacute) patients in total, within three months after the onset of stroke. The characteristics of rehabilitation robots used in the selected studies are described in Table 3. The robots used in the studies were categorized by their applied body and exercise motion.

(p3.0) Recovery of motor impairment after stroke is divided into neurological and functional recovery. While neurological recovery can differ by lesion or location of the stroke, the degree of functional recovery depends on motivation for rehabilitation and the external environmental factors 20) . According to the study reported by Duncan et al. 21) because the recovery of motor function in stroke patients occurs rapidly within the first few weeks of onset, stroke rehabilitation in the early stage has an important role in recovery of motor function. The application of robotics to upper extremity rehabilitation in stroke rehabilitation is increasing, and a variety of associated studies is being carried out 17,18) . According to the previous study 22) , upper extremity robot-assisted therapy improves not only upper extremity function, but also activities of daily living in stroke. However, another study reported that robot-assisted therapy does not affect the improvement of activities of daily living 19) . In addition, one study demonstrated that robot-assisted therapy showed better result than conventional therapies in stroke patients 23) . Like this, the effectiveness of robot-assisted therapy is still controversial. In particular, unclear evidence for the applied robotics and inconsistency of the onset period of subjects led to difficulty in interpreting the effects of robotassisted therapy 9) . Therefore, this study systematically reviewed robot-assisted therapy in the early stage of stroke patients within 3 months after onset. Understanding the purpose of the selected rehabilitation robots is important to understand therapeutic effects of robotassisted therapy on upper extremity 15,16) . Robot applied in the distal part of upper extremity was effectiveness in reducing spasticity 17) . Robot applied in the proximal part robot of upper extremity was effectiveness in improvement of motor function and increase in range of motion [15][16][17][18]24) . Moreover, whole upper extremity robots showed improved motor function of the proximal upper extremity and activities of daily living and recovery of upper extremity function 19) . According to our review, robots with high degree of freedom are more effective in recovery of upper extremity function than robots with one-dimensional movement and a low degree of freedom. In particular, rehabilitation robots that are capable of goal-directed training, in which a patient actively participates in upper extremity rehabilitation while watching a monitor, showed even more positive effects than did other rehabilitation robots.
