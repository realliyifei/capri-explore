(p0.0) Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a core functionality in data management and analytics systems [33]. The performance of OLAP is crucial for many applications that need to use OLAP to make online decisions, e.g., business intelligence. However, it is rather costly to support OLAP for large datasets, especially big data. Many systems have been proposed to support OLAP on big data, e.g., Pig, Hive, Spark SQL, and they usually take tens of minutes or even hours to answer an OLAP query. However, many applications have online requirement of OLAP that want to get results in seconds.

(p3.0) The confidence interval is widely used to estimate the result quality in most of the random-sampling methods [2], where each confidence interval gives users a numerical interval and a corresponding confidence based on the statistical theory. Initially, a set S of samples is computed based on sampling techniques in Sect. 2.1. Then if the data distribution is known in advance, S can be utilized to estimate the distribution and then the error can be estimated based on the distribution (Sect. 2.2.1). If the data distribution is unknown, it needs to first estimate the distribution of sampling data and then estimate the error (Sect. 2.2.2).

(p13.0) DAQ DAQ [92] is a variant of OLA which borrows ideas from probabilistic database and iteratively uses the highorder bits of numerical data to compute the approximation. For example, a DAQ scheme stores numbers in column PROFIT in Fig. 1 using "Bitsliced-Index" [92]. If we query MAX on the column PROFIT, DAQ checks the first bit of the numbers in the 16 tuples of O, if there is only one tuple whose first bit is '1', we get the exact answer rather than travel all the bits (e.g., 32 bits); otherwise, we check the next bit until finding the maximum one. Unfortunately, such technique can only support simple queries over numerical columns (such as SUM and AVG) but cannot support general SQL queries.
## (s29) AQP on Data Cleaning
Number of References: 2

(p29.0) Data is rather dirty, especially in big data era, and data cleaning and integration are rather important in many applications [26]. For example, in Google Scholar, we want to compute the average citations of database researchers. Since some researchers' Google Scholar pages contain publications that do not belong to them, it is incorrect to directly compute the average citations on the dirty data. A straightforward method first cleans the Google Scholar pages for every researchers and then applies the OLAP queries. Obviously this brute-force method is rather expensive. A smarter way is to utilize AQP techniques, which first cleans a sample data and then uses the sample data to compute the results.
## (s36) Approximate Data Visualization

(p36.0) There are still many problems in approximate data visualization. First, how to quantify the accuracy of visualization is an open problem. Second, selecting proper chart type to fit different AQP methods is difficult. It requires to investigate effective techniques for rapidly generating visualizations for other optimization goals (including outlier detection, trend detection) and other data types (such as large networks). Finding new data visualization applications such as ExploreSample [107] is also promising.
