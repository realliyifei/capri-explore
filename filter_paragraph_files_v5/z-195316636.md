## (s11) Synonymy
Number of References: 8

(p11.0) The difficulty of synonymy is that a simple lookup or matching is not enough. For example, the question 'All movies starring Brad Pitt from 2000 until 2010.' (Q3) could also be phrased as 'All movies playing Brad Pitt from 2000 until 2010.'. The answer should be the same, but because in the sample world no element is named 'playing', a lookup would not find an answer. Therefore, it is necessary that the system takes synonyms into account. A possible solution is the use of a translation dictionary. Usually such a dictionary is based on DBpedia (Lehmann et al, 2012) and/or WordNet (Miller, 1995).

## (s31) NLQ/A
Number of References: 2

(p31.0) NLQ/A (Zheng et al, 2017) is an NLI to query a knowledge graph. The system is based on a new approach without NLP technologies like parsers or PoS taggers. The idea being that the errors made by these technologies are not worth the gain of information. For example, a parse tree helps for certain questions like subqueries (e.g., Q9), but if the parse tree is wrong, the system will fail to translate even simpler questions. Instead, NLQ/A lets the users resolve all ambiguity problems, also those which could be solved with PoS tagging or parse trees. To avoid needing too many interaction steps, NLQ/A provides an efficient greedy approach for the interaction process.
## (s32) QuestIO (QUESTion-based Interface to Ontologies)
Number of References: 2

(p32.0) QuestIO (Damljanovic et al, 2008) is an NLI to query ontologies using unconstrained natural language. It automatically extracts human-understandable lexicalization from the ontology. Therefore, the quality of the semantic information in the ontology has to be very high to contain enough human-understandable labels and/or descriptions. For example, the attribute Movie.Release-Date would be extracted as 'Release Date', which is a human-understandable label. In contrast, the attribute Movie.OriginalLang would result in 'Original Lang', where the token 'Lang' is a shortened version for 'Language' and is not human-understandable.
## (s47) AskNow
Number of References: 2

(p47.0) AskNow (Dubey et al, 2016) uses a novel query characterization structure that is resilient to paraphrasing, called Normalized Query Structure (NQS), which is less sensitive to structural variation in the input question. The identification of the elements in the NQS is highly dependent on POS tags. For example, the input question Q1 'Who is the director of " To translate the input question into SPARQL, As-kNow first identifies the sub-structures using a POS tagger and named entity recognition. Then it fits the sub-structures into their corresponding cells within the generic NQS templates. Afterwards the query type (set, boolean, ranking, count or property value) is identified based on desire and wh-type. In the next step, the query desire, query input and their relations will be matched to the KB. As an example, Spotlight can be used for the matching to DBpedia. During the matching process, AskNow uses WordNet synonyms and a BOA pattern library (bootstrapping).
## (s48) SPARKLIS
Number of References: 2

(p48.0) SPARKLIS (Ferré, 2017) is a guided query builder for SPARQL using natural language for better understanding. It guides the users during their query phrasing by giving the possibilities to search through concepts, entities and modifiers in natural language. It relies on the rules of SPARQL to ensure syntactically correct SPARQL queries all the time during the process. The interaction with the system makes the question formulation more constrained, slower and less spontaneous, but it provides guidance and safeness with intermediate answers and suggestions at each step. The translation process for SPARKLIS is reversed: it translates possible SPARQL queries into natural language such that the users can understand their choices.
## (s49) GFMed
Number of References: 2

(p49.0) GFMed (Marginean, 2017) is an NLI for biomedical linked data. It applies grammars manually built with Grammatical Framework 7 (GF). GF grammars are divided into abstract and concrete grammars. The abstract grammar defines the semantic model of the input language and for GFMed this is based on the biomedical domain. The concrete grammars define the syntax of the input language, which is English and SPARQL. Furthermore, GF supports multilingual applications and because of that Romanian is included as a second natural language in GFMed.
