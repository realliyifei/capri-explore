function in the Health, Aging and Body Composition study (n=2,529, mean age =75.9, 63.5% white, 44.9% men). Selfreported energy over the past month was recorded from 0-10 (least to most energy) and dichotomized at the median (≥7=high energy). Cognitive performance was measured using Modified Mini-Mental State Examination and Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Physical function was assessed via fitness (timed 400meter walk), self-reported physical activity, and usual and rapid gait speed. Variables bivariately associated with energy entered a logistic regression model with higher energy as the outcome, adjusted for demographics, chronic conditions, strength, and body mass index (BMI). Overall, 58% of the sample reported high energy, and self-reported energy was greater for males and those without chronic conditions (p<0.05). Lower odds of higher self-reported energy were found for participants with more depressive symptoms (aOR 95% CI= 0.55 [0.50, 0.62]) and longer time to walk 400m (aOR = 0.79 [0.70, 0.89]). Increased odds of higher self-reported energy were found for participants with faster usual and rapid gait speeds (aOR = 1.3 [1.2, 1.5]; aOR = 1.2 [1.1 -1.4], respectively). Associations with cognitive performance were not significant. Higher self-reported energy reflects fewer depressive symptoms and greater physical function independent of demographics, chronic conditions, strength, and BMI.

Data from Medicare claims can provide efficient and timely estimates. However, earlier studies suggest that identifying ADRD populations solely from Medicare claims fails to capture many individuals that live with ADRD, with false-negative cases as high as 60%. We examined nationally representative data from the 2015-2017 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) to assess the claims-based case ascertainment method, covering the transition to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). The study population included community dwellers aged 65 or older, enrolled in traditional fee-for-service (n=12,409). Claims based method identified 1,325 cases (10.7% prevalence). However, there were 196 (1.6%) additional cases that self/proxy reported ADRD, but there was no ADRD diagnosis in any of their Medicare claims (hereafter referred to as self-report only). On average, the self-report only group reported higher numbers of limitations in activities, or instrumental activities of daily living, worse overall health, and more difficulty in concentrating or remembering, suggesting they are likely to be false negatives under claims-based case ascertainment method. In conclusion, claims based case ascertainment methods failed to capture some individuals with ADRD, but the magnitude of false-negative cases declined substantially in the era of ICD-10.


## OUTPATIENT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS SHOULD BE COMPETENT IN CARE OF OLDER ADULTS: A TOTAL POPULATION REGISTER-BASED STUDY Solveig Arnadottir, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland

In Iceland, outpatient physical therapy (OPT) is traditionally not focused on older clients. Yet, the Icelandic population is aging as other populations in the world, and national policies endorse aging in place. The objective of this study was to explore 17 years of demographic information on OPT clients and to identify if this information reflects the total population aging. The research was built on 17 years (1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015) of complete data from: the Icelandic Health Insurances register with information on the total population of OPT clients (N=172071), and the Statistics Iceland register with demographic information on the total general population. The results revealed that in 1999, older adults comprised 18.3% of all OPT clients, and in 2015 it had increased to 23.5% Therefore, OPTs were 23% more likely to treat an older adult in 2015, compared to 1999 (Risk Ratio [RR] 1.23; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.19-1.27). In the same time period older people became 15% more prevalent in the general population (RR 1.15; 95%CI 1.10-1.21). Linear modelling revealed a yearly 3.45% (95%CI 3.05-3.85) increase from 1999 to 2015 in the overall proportion of older OPT clients. This yearly trend, however, varied depending on age group and sex with the highest yearly increase in the ≥ 85 years old men (9.1%; 95%CI 7.90-10.35). This case of Iceland presents 17 years of continuous growth in older adults seeking OPT service. These findings reinforce an urgent need to enhance the geriatric competence of OPTs, who in their clinical practice frequently encounter older adults.

San Francisco VA Medical Center,San Francisco,California,United States Electronic health records (EHRs) are a rich source of health data that could be used to create individualized life expectancy predictions to aid in clinical decision-making for long-term preventative treatments, such as cancer screening. Few previous studies have incorporated all possible predictors from the EHR. We aimed to screen and incorporate a large number of possible predictors from EHR data into a life expectancy (LE) prediction equation. Using the national Veteran's Affairs (VA) EHR databases, we identified all patients aged 50+ with a primary care visit during 2005 and assessed demographics, diseases, medications, laboratory results, healthcare utilization, and vital signs during the one year prior to the visit. Mortality follow-up was complete through 2017. We used an 80% random sample for model development and a 20% random sample for model validation. We used a Gompertz survival model with backwards selection to identify approximately 100 variables for the GSA 2020Annual Scientific Meeting Innovation in Aging, 2020
