Background: Diarrhea founds to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in children less than five years. Various factors are associated with diarrhea but socio-demographic factors are the main key elements, which associated with diarrhea. Methods: This study was examined association of socio-demographic factors with diarrhea in children less than five years of age of Sindh, Pakistan, using data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) conducted from January 2014 to August 2014. Data were collected for 18,108 children in whom 16,449 children had complete data of demographic variables being included in the analysis. Bivariate analysis was done using Pearson's Chi square test and multivariate analysis being done using binary logistic regression. Results: We found increased risk of diarrhea among children lives in rural areas while household wealth index quintile was also associated with diarrhea. Children in the poor, middle and fourth wealth index quintiles being at increased risk of diarrhea compared to children in the richest wealth index quintile. The highest risk of diarrhea was found for the child having mother with no education as well as children aged 12-23 months. Conclusion: Age of child, mother education and wealth index found significant with diarrhea while Male children, child aged 12-23 months, child with no mother education, child from rural areas and child from poor households found with high risk of diarrhea.

## Introduction

Diarrhea is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children less than 5 years.1 More than 10 million children die each year in world, of which about 1.5 million die from diarrhea.2,3 Around 16% of deaths due to diarrhea in children under 5 years from which most of these deaths occur in developing countries. These deaths are avoidable by the existing interventions.4 Diarrhea continues to be a leading cause of child morbidity and mortality in the developing countries. 5 Diarrhea accounted for 700,000 deaths in children under five years of age worldwide which make it the second leading cause of child mortality.6 The highest rates of child mortality reported in Sub-Saharan Africa a n d S o u t h e a s t A s i a . 6 A c c o r d i n g t o P a k i s t a n Demographic and Health Survey 2012-13, 23% of under five children had Diarrhea in past 2 weeks of survey.7 This rate was highest (35%) among children 6-11 months old.7 MICS 2003 reports 12% of children below the age of 5 years in the two weeks prior to the survey, varying from highest 23% in Nawabshah to lowest 5-7% in Jacobabad, Tharparkar and Larkana.8 In urban areas the rate of Diarrhea was found 10% while in rural areas it was reported 13%.8 Various socio-demographic factors found as risk factor for diarrhea among children which include age, gender, residency, mother education, and household economic status 9 Although many studies has been conducted in developed and developing countries to identify risk factors of diarrhea but most of them were based on small community based studies. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the socio-demographic factors associated with diarrhea using a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) in Sindh.


## Methodology

The MICS, whose methodology is described in elsewhere in detail, 10 was conducted across Sindh by the Bureau of Statistics, Planning & Development Department, Government of Sindh in collaboration with support from Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resource (PCRWR) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) from January 2014 to August 2014.Complete Data were collected for 18,108 households. MICS Sindh data set for Children less than 5 years was obtained from UNICEF. Analysis was done for 16,449 children having complete data. Missing and DK (Don't Know) data were removed before performing analysis. Analysis was done by using SPSS version 21. Variables were defined based on MICS-5.Bivariate analysis was done using Pearson's Chi square test while multivariate analysis was done using binary logistic regression. Significant variables were included in Multivariate analysis. Level of significance was set at 0.05.


## Results

Out of 16,449 children, 51.4% were male and 48.6% were female. 9.8% were in age group <6 months,10.7% in 6-11 months,18.9% in 12-23 months,18.6% were in 24-35 months, 21.5% were in 36-47 months and 20.5% were in 48-59 months. Most of the children (61.3%) were from rural areas. 65.6% children of illiterate mothers. It was also found that 2.8% children were never ever breastfeed. About 9.7% of children whose households dispose feces unsafely (left in open).Past 2 weeks prevalence of diarrhea among children was found 28.5% in our data set. Socio-demographic characteristics of Children are presented in Table-1.


## Table-1: Characteristics of Children Age <5 years

Use of ORS was found most common treatment for children with diarrhea. It was also found that male faced more attention for treatment of diarrhea as compared to female children as presented in Figure-1 and Figure-  Diarrhea rate was (52%) in male and (48%) in female children. Prevalence of Diarrhea was found slightly more (4%) in males as compared to females. Diarrhea rate was higher among children aged 12-23 months (26.4%). Majority (97.1%) of children aged less than two years were ever breastfeed. The highest diarrhea rate (32%) was among children from the poorest wealth index quintile while the lowest rate (7.5%) was in children from households with the richest wealth index quintile. Significant association of diarrhea was found with age of child, mother's education and wealth index as presented in Table-2.

## Figure-2: Treatment of diarrhea

Multivariate analysis was done using binary logistic regression. Children whose households were in the poorest wealth index quintiles were about 1.175 times more likely to develop diarrhea than those whose households were in the richest wealth index quintile. The association between mother education and diarrhea in children was marginally significant. Mothers with no formal education were 1.418 times more likely to develop diarrhea in child than mothers with higher secondary education. Children aged 6-11 months were 4.05 times more likely to develop diarrhea than children aged 48-59 months while those aged less than 6 months were 2.19 times more likely to develop diarrhea than those aged 48-59 months as presented in Table-3.

## Discussion

The prevalence of diarrhea found higher (28.5%) in this study than previously reported (23.1%) in Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2012-13 for Sindh,7 this may be due to lower access to clean water and inappropriate hygienic practices in child care. our study showed that males were positively associated with diarrhea which is supported by same result reported by Siziya et al..11 In a study of the male predominance in the incidence of infectious diseases in children, Green found that the theory of immunodeficiency prevalence among males was not supported by an excess of 2-3% in overt symptoms.12 The risk of diarrhea was higher in male than in female children, agreed with other studies. [13][14][15] Significant association of diarrhea was found with wealth index which is same as reported by, other studies. 13,16,17 We found that children with lower quartiles have more risk to develop diarrhea. Boadi and Kuitunen reported the same that children from poor homes had higher diarrheal incidence than their medium wealth and high wealth counterparts.17 Children living in poorer households have higher diarrhea rates than their wealthier counterparts, it may be due to inadequate access to sanitary facilities, unsanitary environments in the home and poor child hygiene. Roots suggested that wealthy parents may be able to reduce risk of exposure due to factors beyond their control, such as contaminated community environments or lack of water. 18 In our study, diarrhea was developed in 61.6% children living in rural areas. El-Gilany and Hammad have reported similar findings from Dakahlia, Egypt.19 this may due to the fact that rural residents tend to be poorer than urban residents, which impact the level of hygiene, especially in areas where there is a cyclic drought that may be affecting more the vulnerable rural population.

We also found higher risk of diarrhea in children aged 12-23 months same was reported in another study.20 Protections against diarrhea in the youngest age group may be conferred by several mechanisms such as maternal antibodies against enteric pathogens and current breastfeeding. It is possible that after the age of 6 month, with the introduction of supplementary foods and changing nutritional habits, this protection is lost. 13,15,19,20 The lower prevalence of diarrhea in the oldest age group may be due to acquired natural immunity. Conclusion Age of child, mother education and wealth index found significant with diarrhea while Male children, child aged 12-23 months, child with no mother education, child from rural areas and child from poor households found with high risk of diarrhea.
