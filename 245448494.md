Lateral Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Rectal Cancer: A Single-Center Experience and Literature Review

Supplementary Fig. 2. Kaplan-Meier curves of cumulative incidence of local recurrence, cumulative incidence of distant recurrence, recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival according to patient groups (total mesorectal excision [TME]-alone group vs. TME with lateral pelvic lymph node dissection [LPLD] group) in subgroup of patients with lateral pelvic lymph node size decreasing to < 5 mm after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
