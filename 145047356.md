Another reason for the use of adm inistrator surveys lies with thei r abi li ty t o define career jl1/eresfs and ident ify the direction In which profes sional deve lopment support Shou ld be provided, In many ways the career interests of educational administrators particu larly at the secondary leve l, are expectlKi to c reate a Gertain degree of change in a schoo l d istrict_ The ab i lity to ant icipate the locus of change and the personnel Impact are fundamental to ensu ri ng effective t ransitions of professional educators.Unl ik6 round• table discussions or isolated st akeholder meet i n~s, adm i n• istrator surveys enab le poliCy ma kers to assess in a more systemati c war the issues in the forefront of the " third wavli' of ed ucational reform -decentral izatio n, deregu lat io n, and the professlonal ization of leade rsh i p roles, parti cularly w it hin the ctassroom Perhaps the most co mpel ling reason for the use of ad• ministrator sUlVeys has to do wit h the training needs and opportunities which are not incl ined to abate, given two key factors: the QrowinO impact of technotogy on teachi no , tearnin9, and administration and the relationship between the future chal l en~es facing especially high school seniors and the current success or failure with which Ihey meet these chal lenges.Can im proved train in g and profess io nal devetopment programs bfunt the growth or reso lve the hig h schoo l dropou t problems?A footnote of caution is offered by Clune (1987) who thinks a paradox exists between the need for indicators of success and the desire to mon itor_ Whi le fu rt her t ra ini ng Is obviously needed, school districts must be ca ref ul that the tra inin g proorams do not lim it tl1emselves in pe rspective or pu rpose, In otherwords, when t rain ing programs resull only in more soph isticated wars, for examp le, to maas u re or monitor dropouts instead of im• ple mentino s uccessful dropout pre_ent ion pr09rams , the use of admin istrator su",eys as alt ernative po li cy instruments becomes remote.

Sensitivity to this conCern is high lighted in Ihe results of a train ing su",ey conducted by the Office of Leadership and School tmprovement of the State Depa rtment of Ed ucation in South Caro lina, The su",ey attempted to obtain information from several respondent groups (su perintendents, high school principals, m idd le school principals, and ele• mentary pri nc ipals) regarding thirt y-six areaS or topics which were considered to be des irable for training pro• grams.Regardless of respondent group, it was clear that the training pro grams preferred were not merely new ways 10 monlfOr sWrienl performance.Rather, strategies to moli• vate SWdents were ident ified among all respondent \Iroups as a highly desirable top ic fort raining programs.Middle and high school principals cons idered "motivat ing Sludent s" as the most high ly desirable top iC, Since carefully arti culated t raining programs are show n to res ul t from admi ni strator su rveys, how should organizatio ns proceed in developing the ir own sUIVeys?What types of s UIVeys should be reg arded and for what purpose?These questions are fundamental to the task of construct• ing meaningfu l survey Instru ments.

T~e tendency not to associate the reason for develop• ing ad ministrator su",eys w ith Ihe manner in which they should be constructed often establis hes problems fo r d istrict po li cy makers, educational ad min istrators, and se", ice provide rs.Surveys tend to be derived fro m one of seve ral perspect ives.A rev iew of se lect ed LEAD Projects po i nts to the need for art iCUlation of the su",ey questionnal re wit h its intended purJX!se-demographic dala bank, career intereSf promes, and professional training surveys, Seve ral exam• pies illu strate th i s po int

The North Dakota LEAD Center in col labo ration with the Un ive rsity of North Dakota Bureau of Educational Re• search conducted two sUlVeys.One was desig ned to provide information to the UniverSity and LEAD for decisioo mak ing with reoard to the educational adm inistrator activities of female reachers, With a reasonable respo nse rateol 47.2 percent, organ izers of the project were ab le to determ ine the career interests and trajning needs of female edu• cators.ResJX!ndents who expressed interest in ed ucationa l ad min istration as a career were asked to rate on a fi .epont scale thirteen top ics embracing issues of leade rship and management of schools_ The topic which received the Qreatest amount of interest (more than 70 percent of the re• spondents) was "what it takes to become an effective ad• m inistrator.' inqui ries of this nature prov ide a good basis for the development of professional train in9 programs .Comparatively, the results of the second SUlVey were equal ly convi ncing w it h regard to top ics for professional training Of t he reSJX!ndents in the second survey, ove r 70 perce nt In• dicated great Inte rest in the same t opic-"what it takes to become an effective ad min ist rator."

The Virg inia LEAD Cente, also recogn ized the impo r' tance of collaboration w ith professional assoc iations and the State Department of Educat ion.The focus of the su ",ey was t o obtain demographic prollles of educational administrators and to asseSS fhe professionat devetopment needs of soh Dol administrators in the state, The deve lop ment of the su",ey instrument was a collaborative endeavor.Responses from the 52 question su",ey we re later reviewed by the Vi rgin ia Department of Educat ion and colleges and universities as a formative ste p in planning in•selVice and pre• seIVi~e programs lor educational ad min ist rators.

It appears that the collaborafive nature of th is project was a conscious effort to max im ize the response rate to the su",ey and to maint ain open lines of communication with un iversit ies and professional assoc iations.Of the 4,677 s ur• vey Instruments distributed, 77 percent we re ret ri eved.Of the 3,728 relumed, 76 percent were co nsidered to have valid resJX!nses_In add ition, the Virgin ia su",ey ide ntified preferred types of profess ional deve lopment activit ies and desirable train ing schedules_ One-day regio nal workshops, vis itations to other sc hool divisions and state leve l confer-enCes were the preferred ty pes of professional development proorams, while Thursdars , Wed nesdays, and Tuesdays respectively were the mo st desirable days to ho ld train• in g ac tivities.Informat ion from the su",ey resu lt s was util ized for both scholarly research in the un ivers ity com• mun it y and f or the development of prom is ino trai n i n~ pro• grams w hich enhance leadersh ip and management skill s, SUIVey res ults from a variety of LEAD Ceoter proje<:ts underscore the benefits of COllaboration in desig ning the instru ment and data uti lizat ion, Massachusetts , No rt h Dakota , South Carolina, and Virg inia LEAD Cente rs in particular il lu st rate the value of planning, imp lementing, and evaluatino research projects in conce rt w it h the un ivers ity commun ity and profess ional associat ions, The reasons for conducting su",eys seem to have sufficient j ust ification_ DemographiC in/ormation po ints to the inc reasing need to have good data wh ich wil l al low fo r ti mely and respo nsive po li cy decisions to prob lems of ad min istrative turnove r rates and the Inc reas.edage of current adm inistrators.In fact, a recent report of the American Association of Schoo l Administrators ind icate the number of o lder administrators has increased, espec ially for those 5-5 years of age and over.Increased age coupled wit h longevity in posit io n (Massachusetts LEAD Project reports that 50 percent of elementary principals have been in their posit io ns for mo'e than 10 years) present serious ~hal lenges to the consort ium members involved in LEAD Ce nter Projects_ Wh ile the racenl educational reform movemen t has focused on such c rit ical issues as st udent academic ach ie.ement, profess iona lizi ng teaching as a career and restructuring schools, little atlention has been given to the need to attract and develop cadres of talented professio nals w ho see k ca,~er advanc"m~nr.The tas k 01 dec idi ng on a dat a gat hertng Instrumenl or a process 10 idenlify issues or concerns regarding career interests could be accomp lished in a number of ways.Administrator SUM>ys offer a comparative ad.antage for eflicient data co llection ar>d mean inQlul pro-ceSS lor po licy formu lation reQardinQ personnel issues.Othe r po licy instruments m iQht be chosen on the bas is of variab les of costs, the beare rs of costs and const ituents s""'''d.This method, while practical in nature , becomes o.ertime more id iosyncrat ic to t he pol itical w inds 01 negotiat ion.tn contrast, ad ministrator survey instru ments con-I~oote to the l>ul lding 01 genera lizab le models of policy instruments.

Despite the range 01 issues identif ied in Ihe educatio nal relorm movement and the numbe r of unanswered questions regard ing successful practices of profeSSional development activities, th~ use of adm inistrator surveys is cons ide red to be prod uctive.This approach seeks to develop a I ink between the needs of practi tioners, the goals of pol icy makers, and the desired effects 01 reform strategies conce i.ed by service providers.Admin istrator surveys serve a valuable descri pt i.e funct ion.Yet the ability to pro.lde lhe po l icy commun ity w ith an insightful alternative Instrument may be its st rongeSI asset
