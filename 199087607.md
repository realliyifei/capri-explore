Bionic prosthetic limbs are rapidly advancing. In-depth knowledge of this field until recently, was only required by those working in specialized prosthetics. With evolving technology, it is likely that both demand and utilization of bionic limbs will increase, and more extensive understanding will be necessary.The bionic limb of today has progressed greatly, but it still endures high user abandonment (dismissal). The explanations behind dismissal, were deficient functionality of the equipment, compatibility with the subject, fragile design, and complex control methods.In the past decade, academia and industry have achieved real improvements in the technical features of bionic prosthetics limbs and techniques for bionic interface and control. Advanced robotic hands are offered by several organizations and research groups, with an assortment of active and passive wrist options customizable over several degrees of freedom. Currently, elbow joint designs incorporate dynamic arrangements with different weight and power alternatives. Control features are progressing in digital capability with options for sensor incorporation and multi-joint articulation. Recent advances in socket design are encouraging implantable and multiple surface electromyography sensors for customary and Osseo integration-based systems. Cost is a barrier affecting the usage of bionic prosthetics, particularly for support, repair and replacement, and constraints increasing component complexity to perform more distinct tasks. Lifetime costs of bionic prosthetic care are high. Furthermore, issues in quality, adaptability, continuance, and versatility are key factors that limits the usage of bionics. We present a literature review covering the current state of the bionic prosthetic limb market and its technical base for both technologies and techniques. We examine the functionality and features of the world's leading solution architectures and its impact on bionic product design. We do this in a value-added methodology exploring the body of knowledge for key areas underpinning the adoption of cutting edge bionic prosthetic technology. Finally, we provide a decision analysis model; recommendations for current research shortfalls; and future research needs.

## Introduction

A bionic prosthetic is an artificial limb that enhances the function and lifestyle of the person with a missing body part. Bionic prosthetics help restore the normal function of missing limbs. Today artificial limbs can be controlled by computer, brain, and provide sensation with advanced technology. Rising incidence of fractures, increasing awareness among the people towards innovative technology, and high health care spending has fueled market growth. Rising awareness regarding the technology benefits of advanced prosthetics in the developing countries, high adoption of advanced products and growing use of novel materials for the manufacture of prosthetics are amongst few factors expected to drive demand for these devices. The bionic prosthetics market is dominated by North America which includes USA and Canada. Key drivers owing to market growth include rising adoption of advanced products, surging numbers of amputees, increasing incidence of foot ulcers associated with diabetes, and favorable government initiatives for bionics to address healthcare expenses.

Europe holds the second position in the global bionic prosthetics market due to government support for development and availability of funds for research. This is expected to continue driving the European market over the forecasted period. For instance, countries like Germany and France are increasing investment in the healthcare domain.

The Asia Pacific is a huge market. Countries like India, the Philippines, Indonesia and China are experiencing fast growth due to their aging population, growing awareness about new technology, and availability of funds. Asia Pacific is the fastest growing market owing to huge diabetic population, quick economic development and improving healthcare infrastructure in emerging nations, notably India and China. Additionally, they are open to adopting new technology, and best treatment options to improve the quality of life for their citizens. Furthermore, increasing demand for quality devices in the healthcare is projected to lead to the use of advanced equipment, which, in turn, is likely to increase the market growth of the bionic prosthetics in the region. Increasing demand for quality product attract the focus of market players in this region, thus, they are introducing the advanced technology to maximize the profit in this region. Also, the lower cost of treatment in India attracts patient population from other countries.

Alternatively, the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region holds the lowest market share due to low investment and a poor healthcare infrastructure. See Figure 2 below for market area definition:


## Figure 2: Major World Prosthetic Markets

The incidences of amputation are rising due to various factors such as accidents, disabilities, increasing prevalence of obesity, diabetes, vascular diseases, etc.

Relatively low expense of producing synthetic polymer scaffolds, coupled with the ability to tune various properties associated with them, has been key to their extensive use and offers great potential for the future.

The use of synthetic polymer scaffolds is the most widely investigated method for producing a tissue-engineered vascular draft (TEVG).


## Restraining Factor

Growth Factor 


## Bionic Prosthetics

The global bionic prosthetics market is segmented based on product, technology, application, and end user.

Based on product, it is segmented into prosthetic arms, prosthetic feet/ankles, prosthetic legs/knees, prosthetic hands, and others.

Based on technology, it is segmented into prosthetic foot materials, Bluetooth, microprocessor knees, myoelectric technology, and others.

Based on application, it is segmented into the lower body extremity and upper body extremity.

Based on end user, it is segmented into hospitals, clinics, and others.


## Current Technologies


## Microprocessor Controlled Lower Limb Prostheses

Microprocessor controlled knees offer dynamic control through sensors in the shin. Microprocessor controlled knees attempt to simulate normal biological knee function, by offering variable resistance control to the swing or stance phases of the gait cycle. This allows the user to safely perform ramp and stair descent in a stepover-step manner. The swing-rate adjustments allow the knee to respond to rapid changes in cadence. Microprocessor controlled knee flexion, enhances the stumble recovery capability of the patient, by preventing unexpected knee buckling. Prosthetic knees such as the microprocessor-controlled knee that focus on better control of flexion abilities, without reducing stability, have the potential to improve gait pattern, wearer confidence, and safety of ambulation. The microprocessor knee is more beneficial at higher ambulation speed in physically fit patients. Available devices include, but are not limited to, Otto-Bock C-Leg device®, the OssurRheoKnee® or the Endolite Intelligent Prosthesis®. A microprocessorcontrolled ankle foot prosthesis (e.g., Proprio Foot) can actively change the ankle angle and to identify sloping gradients and ascent or descent of stairs as the result of microprocessor-control and sensor technology.


## Myoelectric Prosthetic

A myoelectric prosthesis uses electromyography signals or potentials from voluntarily contracted muscles within a person's residual limb via the surface of the skin, to control movement of the prosthesis, such as elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation or hand opening/closing of the fingers0. Prosthetics of this type utilize the residual neuro-muscular system of the human body to control the functions of an electric powered prosthetic hand, wrist or elbow. This type differs from the traditional electric switch prosthesis that requires body movement with mechanical devices to actuate or operate switches controlling prosthetic movement. Rather this type has a self-suspending socket, with pick up electrodes placed over flexors and extensors, for the movement of flexion and extension respectively.

These two objectives involve a complex set of technical, clinical, programmatic, and regulatory challenges. To address these challenges and to accomplish these objectives,


## Material

Study is directed towards the loss of function of an upper extremity because of stroke or spinal cord injury or a physical loss from amputation, an individual's life is forever changed, and activities that were once routine become a magnitude more difficult. Much research and effort have been put into developing advanced robotic prostheses to restore upper extremity function. Because the upper extremities can perform a wide variety of activities, several types of upper extremity prostheses are available ranging from passive cosmetic limbs to externally powered robotic limbs. In addition, new developments in brain-machine interface are poised to revolutionize how patients can control these advanced prostheses using their thoughts alone. For patients with spinal cord injury or stroke, Osseointegration is an emerging surgical technique for direct skeletal attachment of prostheses which may one day render sockets antiquated and obsolete for many patients.

Traditional prosthetic knees are passive in nature and are designed to balance stability with mobility during the gait cycle.

Microprocessors have helped to improve the timing of this balance and even anticipate actions such as the stumble recovery feature of the Otto Bock Cleg (Minneapolis, MN).

Several manufacturers are developing externally powered, They seeks to develop a revolutionary 23degree-of-freedom upper-limb prosthesis, spans multiple institutions and disciplines.

APL serves as the system integrator, coordinating efforts among the various participants, One of the revolutionizing goals of the program is to produce a fully neurally integrated upper-extremity prosthetic.

RP3's program goals include developing an end-toend system to capitalize on today's neuroscience understanding and enable tetraplegics to perform functions they would normally perform with functional natural limbs. Developing such a system requires several system components and subsystems 


## Findings

Electrical isolation of muscle groups improves EMG signal and crosstalk generated by neighboring muscle contractions. This isolation can be accomplished by inserting an adipo-fascial flap between adjacent muscle groups. In addition to motor function, sensation such as touch, pressure, vibration, and temperature for the missing limb is often restored to the skin overlying the newly reinnervated muscles.

TMR-compatible elbows can process the signals from multiple inputs simultaneously. Advanced pattern recognition (APR) refers to the use of computer algorithms to decipher surface electrode data and subsequently associate specific signal patterns with the appropriate prosthesis response for patients. A number of new implantable electrodes have been developed to improve myoelectric device control. It amplify peripheral nerve signals and thus improve the responsiveness via a more reliable neuromuscular unitprosthesis interface and/or permit the reception of signals from individual muscle groups, SA algorithms have been developed to take single unit activities and local field potentials from the primary motor and premotor cortex to decode an entire suite of dexterous movements, such as individual flexion/extension of each finger and grasps.

Key accomplishments associated with this cortical stimulation research include the following: Characterization of safe and effective stimulation pulse characteristics, Team defined charge-balanced, biphasic, and interpulse interval durations and amplitude attributes. Contact detection and pressure and location discrimination:


## Results of Research in literature review

Advanced robotic prosthetic technology is flourishing, promising to transform functional neuro-restoration. Options available to patients with upper extremity dysfunction or limb loss are expanding.

These advances make it possible for patients to improve quality of life, recover function, and regain independence. Exciting advances in robotic prosthetic technologies are certain to revolutionize patient treatment.

As advanced surgical techniques become more mainstream, continued prosthetic component advancements will also be required. The ultimate goal of prosthetic science is to restore each amputee to his or her pre-morbid level of function; towards this end, much work remains to be done.

The MPL is a highly advanced robotic prosthetic upper extremity capable of gross movements and highly dexterous fine manipulation. Coupled with neural control algorithms, the MPL enables users to perform limb movements through control.


## Decision Modeling and Discussion

Notional Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) decision analysis was conducted of the most promising and cost affordable prosthetic products, compared to the baseline of no prosthetics and some future hybrid products. Utility was based on weighting and scoring all the metrics below to compare prosthetic alternatives. From this analysis, we project future product development for bionic prosthetics. Licensed Under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY Furthermore, we compare performance (functionality, serviceability, durability and ease-of-use) with primarily cost and secondarily aesthetics. The goal structure with absolute weights shown by goal (boxes) and metrics (ovals) is shown to the right.

Cost and Performance typically have an inverse value relationship. To increase prosthetic performance, one must increase cost which reduces the overall value. Dependent on the global region, the same cost and performance mix may radically differ in real value to the end consumer of prosthetic products. 


## Discussion

So far, material, prosthetic human compatibility, functionality and cost are the biggest hurdles. At present, it is now possible to achieve the real-life motion of lost limbs, but not affordably. Thus, cost concern is driving inexpensive prosthetics such as Jaipur Leg, Nepal Hand and Swiss leg. As a trade-off, these prosthetics have limitations when it comes to functioning same as a lost limb.

The amputation of a limb, whether upper or lower, is an extremely traumatic experience for the patient and carries both emotional and physical side effects with it. Once finally adjusted to a prosthetic limb, a patient then encounters numerous health issues, such as skin infection and muscle strains. Recent advancements in bionic limbs point toward a brighter future for prosthetic users, as these devices both replicate the missing body part and respond to brain signals just as the replaced limb would. Bionic limbs also allow users to perform a much wider array of motions, including dancing and climbing. [Li 2017] proposes artificial muscles inspired by origami (Japanese paper art) and actuated by fluid gives a direction towards having prosthetics powered by these artificial muscles. Similar studies have been done by Professor Dieter Mankau at the Hochschule fürGestaltung in Offenbach show promising results specifically in prosthetic development. Application of this can be seen by the FESTO Robotics in Bionic handling assistant (elephant trunk) that showcases the capabilities of such concept. But the shortcoming with this technology is the inability to pressurize the power fluids by an actuator required to be as small as the size and energy of human heart. R&D in micro-power applications is an ongoing research need.

"Another likely blockbuster bionic solution is brain-powered prosthetics that can completely replace the function of a lost limb through activation of brain-controlled interface." [James 2017] talks about the controls aspect of prosthetic inspired by actual functionality of limbs using signals from nervous system. That is to reconnect nerve endings using electrodes and encode received Electromyogram signals (EMG Signals) to act as a logic operator.

The method as such, opens doors for physically lesser complex human-machine interface, but it would have several calibration complications with the nervous system. This method requires sophisticated surgery to expose neurons and have a socket installed in bones for lost limb attachments. Nano-surgical procedures and Nano-therapy are implied future research efforts.

The present prosthetics technology which is primarily modification of earlier work.

Step by step these developments continue to evolve and improve over time.

According to Prosthetics Advances, the United States patented the first suction suspension valve in 1863, utilizing it until World War II. Germany expanded the use of the suction knee for military amputees. In 1970, the German company Otto-Back introduced lightweight, modular endoskeleton components that could easily be aligned, which are still being modified and developed today. The same article talks about the advancement in Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) where motor nerves whose primary target muscle groups have been lost, are re-implanted into deliberately enervated proximal muscles. This was the new advance, at Frontier, where his technique increases the number of control sites allowing for simultaneous control of multiple movements. Natural attempted movements result in corresponding expected movement of the prosthesis. [Schmidt 2012] propose there is less need for relearning and remapping of muscle actions. Further evolution in the development of getting muscles to respond, the when they implanted their first patient, a subject with a neurodegenerative condition that prevents them from controlling their upper and lower extremities. The experience gained with this patient includes insight into the nature of human subject research with the MPL and a sense for how such a system can improve the lives of tetraplegics.

As Prosthetic advances state, as advanced surgical techniques become more mainstream, continued prosthetic Licensed Under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY component advancements will also be required. The goal of prosthetic science is to restore each amputee to his or her pre-morbid level of function; towards this end, much work remains to be done.

Cardiac bionics is a recent entrant to the field of bionics for emerging markets and has already established its credibility in addressing a range of debilitating disorders such as ischemic heart disease, necessitating invasive interventions.

In addition, bionic devices for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) involve minimally invasive devices that mimic the function of lungs.


## Making artificial limbs lifelike

Although some amputees like the robotic appearance of prosthetic components, most prefer a limb that is lifelike and therefore inconspicuous. The same silicone materials that contribute to socket comfort have also been used to create incredibly realistic external coverings for both upper and lower limb devices. The present state of the art is the creation of a care-fully sculpted match for the opposite limb, with individual coloring to give a lifelike finish.Unfortunately, such custom made prosthetic -skins‖ are costly (about $3500), particularly since they need replacement after a few years because of unavoidable wear and tear from normal use. Silicone is also a relatively heavy material, so thesearch continues for a lightweight alternative, ideally offering greater flexibility and durability. Because of the costs involved, most amputees currently receive -semicustom‖ external coverings that are mass produced industrially from less expensive materials and provide only a generic external appearance.


## The potential of low cost, limited function prostheses

Makers of bionic prosthetic arms and legs also fight an uphill financial battle. -You have a high-end product with a small market and that does make it challenging,‖ Then there's the cost of purchasing a prosthetic limb or artificial organ. A recent study published by the Worcester Polytechnic Institute found that robotic upper limb prosthetics cost $20,000 to $120,000. Although some private insurance companies will cover 50 to 80 percent of the fee, others have payment caps or cover only one device in a patient's lifetime. Insurance companies are also known to question whether the most advanced prosthetics are -medically necessary.‖ Herr believes that insurance providers need to radically rethink their cost-benefit analyses. Although the latest bionic prosthetics are more expensive per unit than less-complex devices, he argues, they reduce health care payouts across the lifetime of the patient. -When leg amputees use low-tech prostheses, they develop joint conditions, knee arthritis, hip arthritis, and they're on continual pain medication,‖ says Herr. -They don't walk that much because walking is difficult, and that drives cardiovascular disease and obesity.

More we talk about prosthetics, we must cover the topic of materials, as they also evolve during time and now technology talks about Biomaterials, to get the senses back to the amputee however, with this biomaterial they have strived to illustrate the versatility and potential of these materials. Indeed, one could postulate that the versatility of smart materials is limited only by the imaginations of their designers and by the scientists who use them. Interestingly, a recently published article discussing the -intelligence‖ of smart materials hypothesized that if current smart materials were rated using a standard IQ test, they would have an IQ of 2 -impressive for inanimate compounds. And researchers are continuing to develop smarter, more useful compounds.

While there are many bionic devices at various stages of commercialization, their adoption rates are modest, with the exception of robotic exoskeletons for rehabilitation. In North America, companies such as Advanced Bionics, ReWalk Robotics and Medtronic have been successful in increasing the large-scale adoption of bionic prosthetics, achieving impressive market penetration.


## Conclusion

The promising developments in lower-limb prostheses have allowedexperts to feel optimistic. With vast room forimprovement in lower-limb prostheses,it encourages researchgroups to include cutting-edge technologyin all prosthetic components. This paves the wayfor improvements in prosthetic fabricationas well as other fields thatrequire similar technology.The R&D of lower-limb prostheses demands multidisciplinary research that requires collaborative cross-field research. Myoelectric controlled prosthetic limbs, considered to be the most exciting developmentin the field, need incorporationof mechanical moving parts,electrical circuits, bioelectronics, andmaterial science. The myoelectric-controlledprosthetic limbs function by usingelectrical signals from the amputee'snerves to the prosthesis, similar to the natural leg. While lower-limb prosthetics are increasingly sophisticated, they need to balance implicitly, elegance and cost. Growth inthe number of manufacturers of theseprosthetics is seen throughout theworld. Every product that improvesthe usability and reliability for theamputee is a societal win-win. Extensive researchis underway on implantable stumps,which may eradicate the need for asocket. With parallel developments in nanotech, bioprinting, prosthetics, and robotics,superhuman-like body parts will nolonger be fantasia.

Most of these technologies require time. The field of bionic prosthetics is of continuous development and despite human desire over time especially since World War I, there has been no significant improvement until now. With availability of modern technologies and advancement in the field of biomedical engineering, new possibilities are being discovered. The devising of replacement limbs with real lifelike capabilities is a reachable dream. Various articles talk about such discoveries and challenges that are being faced by researchers.

The future development of prostheses will depend greatly on demand. The market for low cost, limited function devices will continue to expand to meet the needs of the developing world, as well as the funding restrictions common in all economies. Innovative technologies will continue to be adapted from the aerospace and computer industries. Their application to high performance artificial limbs, will create Licensed Under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY more natural limb function. Currently, prosthetic innovations are used sparingly, primarily by amputees with private funding, particularly those who are competitive athletes. As research continues, manufacturers will apply the same principles reducing cost less active individuals in the greater market. The performance of prosthesis, particularly bionics will improve as a result. Furthermore, newer materials, high power nanotech and applications will be used for the benefit of amputees in developing countries, despite differences in the cause of amputation and people's needs. Financial constraints limit the rate of advancement in prosthetics, and one of the greatest challenges for the new millennium will be to find the will and the way to fund widespread application of prosthetic innovations. Our analysis shows the trade-offs required to balance performance, cost and aesthetics for future prosthetics bionic product development. The notional decision model that was developed shows the movement of cost vs. performance value. As the cost impact increases (moving right) higher performance and more costly solutions become lower in total value. See Figure 5 below.


## Figure 5: Cost Sensitivity on Prosthetic Total Value

The real challenge for prosthetic product development will be to balance cost and performance not only in materials, but also in improved prosthetic mechanism employment.

## Current Technologies


## Microprocessor Controlled Lower Limb Prostheses

Microprocessor controlled knees offer dynamic control through sensors in the shin. Microprocessor controlled knees attempt to simulate normal biological knee function, by offering variable resistance control to the swing or stance phases of the gait cycle. This allows the user to safely perform ramp and stair descent in a stepover-step manner. The swing-rate adjustments allow the knee to respond to rapid changes in cadence. Microprocessor controlled knee flexion, enhances the stumble recovery capability of the patient, by preventing unexpected knee buckling. Prosthetic knees such as the microprocessor-controlled knee that focus on better control of flexion abilities, without reducing stability, have the potential to improve gait pattern, wearer confidence, and safety of ambulation. The microprocessor knee is more beneficial at higher ambulation speed in physically fit patients. Available devices include, but are not limited to, Otto-Bock C-Leg device®, the OssurRheoKnee® or the Endolite Intelligent Prosthesis®. A microprocessorcontrolled ankle foot prosthesis (e.g., Proprio Foot) can actively change the ankle angle and to identify sloping gradients and ascent or descent of stairs as the result of microprocessor-control and sensor technology.


## Myoelectric Prosthetic

A myoelectric prosthesis uses electromyography signals or potentials from voluntarily contracted muscles within a person's residual limb via the surface of the skin, to control movement of the prosthesis, such as elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation or hand opening/closing of the fingers0. Prosthetics of this type utilize the residual neuro-muscular system of the human body to control the functions of an electric powered prosthetic hand, wrist or elbow. This type differs from the traditional electric switch prosthesis that requires body movement with mechanical devices to actuate or operate switches controlling prosthetic movement. Rather this type has a self-suspending socket, with pick up electrodes placed over flexors and extensors, for the movement of flexion and extension respectively.

These two objectives involve a complex set of technical, clinical, programmatic, and regulatory challenges. To address these challenges and to accomplish these objectives,


## Material

Study is directed towards the loss of function of an upper extremity because of stroke or spinal cord injury or a physical loss from amputation, an individual's life is forever changed, and activities that were once routine become a magnitude more difficult. Much research and effort have been put into developing advanced robotic prostheses to restore upper extremity function. Because the upper extremities can perform a wide variety of activities, several types of upper extremity prostheses are available ranging from passive cosmetic limbs to externally powered robotic limbs. In addition, new developments in brain-machine interface are poised to revolutionize how patients can control these advanced prostheses using their thoughts alone. For patients with spinal cord injury or stroke, Osseointegration is an emerging surgical technique for direct skeletal attachment of prostheses which may one day render sockets antiquated and obsolete for many patients.

Traditional prosthetic knees are passive in nature and are designed to balance stability with mobility during the gait cycle.

Microprocessors have helped to improve the timing of this balance and even anticipate actions such as the stumble recovery feature of the Otto Bock Cleg (Minneapolis, MN).

Several manufacturers are developing externally powered, They seeks to develop a revolutionary 23degree-of-freedom upper-limb prosthesis, spans multiple institutions and disciplines.

APL serves as the system integrator, coordinating efforts among the various participants, One of the revolutionizing goals of the program is to produce a fully neurally integrated upper-extremity prosthetic.

RP3's program goals include developing an end-toend system to capitalize on today's neuroscience understanding and enable tetraplegics to perform functions they would normally perform with functional natural limbs. Developing such a system requires several system components and subsystems 


## Findings

Electrical isolation of muscle groups improves EMG signal and crosstalk generated by neighboring muscle contractions. This isolation can be accomplished by inserting an adipo-fascial flap between adjacent muscle groups. In addition to motor function, sensation such as touch, pressure, vibration, and temperature for the missing limb is often restored to the skin overlying the newly reinnervated muscles.

TMR-compatible elbows can process the signals from multiple inputs simultaneously. Advanced pattern recognition (APR) refers to the use of computer algorithms to decipher surface electrode data and subsequently associate specific signal patterns with the appropriate prosthesis response for patients. A number of new implantable electrodes have been developed to improve myoelectric device control. It amplify peripheral nerve signals and thus improve the responsiveness via a more reliable neuromuscular unitprosthesis interface and/or permit the reception of signals from individual muscle groups, SA algorithms have been developed to take single unit activities and local field potentials from the primary motor and premotor cortex to decode an entire suite of dexterous movements, such as individual flexion/extension of each finger and grasps.

Key accomplishments associated with this cortical stimulation research include the following: Characterization of safe and effective stimulation pulse characteristics, Team defined charge-balanced, biphasic, and interpulse interval durations and amplitude attributes. Contact detection and pressure and location discrimination:


## Results of Research in literature review

Advanced robotic prosthetic technology is flourishing, promising to transform functional neuro-restoration. Options available to patients with upper extremity dysfunction or limb loss are expanding.

These advances make it possible for patients to improve quality of life, recover function, and regain independence. Exciting advances in robotic prosthetic technologies are certain to revolutionize patient treatment.

As advanced surgical techniques become more mainstream, continued prosthetic component advancements will also be required. The ultimate goal of prosthetic science is to restore each amputee to his or her pre-morbid level of function; towards this end, much work remains to be done.

The MPL is a highly advanced robotic prosthetic upper extremity capable of gross movements and highly dexterous fine manipulation. Coupled with neural control algorithms, the MPL enables users to perform limb movements through control.


## Decision Modeling and Discussion

Notional Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) decision analysis was conducted of the most promising and cost affordable prosthetic products, compared to the baseline of no prosthetics and some future hybrid products. Utility was based on weighting and scoring all the metrics below to compare prosthetic alternatives. From this analysis, we project future product development for bionic prosthetics. Licensed Under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY Furthermore, we compare performance (functionality, serviceability, durability and ease-of-use) with primarily cost and secondarily aesthetics. The goal structure with absolute weights shown by goal (boxes) and metrics (ovals) is shown to the right.

Cost and Performance typically have an inverse value relationship. To increase prosthetic performance, one must increase cost which reduces the overall value. Dependent on the global region, the same cost and performance mix may radically differ in real value to the end consumer of prosthetic products. 


## Discussion

So far, material, prosthetic human compatibility, functionality and cost are the biggest hurdles. At present, it is now possible to achieve the real-life motion of lost limbs, but not affordably. Thus, cost concern is driving inexpensive prosthetics such as Jaipur Leg, Nepal Hand and Swiss leg. As a trade-off, these prosthetics have limitations when it comes to functioning same as a lost limb.

The amputation of a limb, whether upper or lower, is an extremely traumatic experience for the patient and carries both emotional and physical side effects with it. Once finally adjusted to a prosthetic limb, a patient then encounters numerous health issues, such as skin infection and muscle strains. Recent advancements in bionic limbs point toward a brighter future for prosthetic users, as these devices both replicate the missing body part and respond to brain signals just as the replaced limb would. Bionic limbs also allow users to perform a much wider array of motions, including dancing and climbing. [Li 2017] proposes artificial muscles inspired by origami (Japanese paper art) and actuated by fluid gives a direction towards having prosthetics powered by these artificial muscles. Similar studies have been done by Professor Dieter Mankau at the Hochschule fürGestaltung in Offenbach show promising results specifically in prosthetic development. Application of this can be seen by the FESTO Robotics in Bionic handling assistant (elephant trunk) that showcases the capabilities of such concept. But the shortcoming with this technology is the inability to pressurize the power fluids by an actuator required to be as small as the size and energy of human heart. R&D in micro-power applications is an ongoing research need.

"Another likely blockbuster bionic solution is brain-powered prosthetics that can completely replace the function of a lost limb through activation of brain-controlled interface." [James 2017] talks about the controls aspect of prosthetic inspired by actual functionality of limbs using signals from nervous system. That is to reconnect nerve endings using electrodes and encode received Electromyogram signals (EMG Signals) to act as a logic operator.

The method as such, opens doors for physically lesser complex human-machine interface, but it would have several calibration complications with the nervous system. This method requires sophisticated surgery to expose neurons and have a socket installed in bones for lost limb attachments. Nano-surgical procedures and Nano-therapy are implied future research efforts.

The present prosthetics technology which is primarily modification of earlier work.

Step by step these developments continue to evolve and improve over time.

According to Prosthetics Advances, the United States patented the first suction suspension valve in 1863, utilizing it until World War II. Germany expanded the use of the suction knee for military amputees. In 1970, the German company Otto-Back introduced lightweight, modular endoskeleton components that could easily be aligned, which are still being modified and developed today. The same article talks about the advancement in Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) where motor nerves whose primary target muscle groups have been lost, are re-implanted into deliberately enervated proximal muscles. This was the new advance, at Frontier, where his technique increases the number of control sites allowing for simultaneous control of multiple movements. Natural attempted movements result in corresponding expected movement of the prosthesis. [Schmidt 2012] propose there is less need for relearning and remapping of muscle actions. Further evolution in the development of getting muscles to respond, the when they implanted their first patient, a subject with a neurodegenerative condition that prevents them from controlling their upper and lower extremities. The experience gained with this patient includes insight into the nature of human subject research with the MPL and a sense for how such a system can improve the lives of tetraplegics.

As Prosthetic advances state, as advanced surgical techniques become more mainstream, continued prosthetic Licensed Under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY component advancements will also be required. The goal of prosthetic science is to restore each amputee to his or her pre-morbid level of function; towards this end, much work remains to be done.

Cardiac bionics is a recent entrant to the field of bionics for emerging markets and has already established its credibility in addressing a range of debilitating disorders such as ischemic heart disease, necessitating invasive interventions.

In addition, bionic devices for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) involve minimally invasive devices that mimic the function of lungs.


## Making artificial limbs lifelike

Although some amputees like the robotic appearance of prosthetic components, most prefer a limb that is lifelike and therefore inconspicuous. The same silicone materials that contribute to socket comfort have also been used to create incredibly realistic external coverings for both upper and lower limb devices. The present state of the art is the creation of a care-fully sculpted match for the opposite limb, with individual coloring to give a lifelike finish.Unfortunately, such custom made prosthetic -skins‖ are costly (about $3500), particularly since they need replacement after a few years because of unavoidable wear and tear from normal use. Silicone is also a relatively heavy material, so thesearch continues for a lightweight alternative, ideally offering greater flexibility and durability. Because of the costs involved, most amputees currently receive -semicustom‖ external coverings that are mass produced industrially from less expensive materials and provide only a generic external appearance.


## The potential of low cost, limited function prostheses

Makers of bionic prosthetic arms and legs also fight an uphill financial battle. -You have a high-end product with a small market and that does make it challenging,‖ Then there's the cost of purchasing a prosthetic limb or artificial organ. A recent study published by the Worcester Polytechnic Institute found that robotic upper limb prosthetics cost $20,000 to $120,000. Although some private insurance companies will cover 50 to 80 percent of the fee, others have payment caps or cover only one device in a patient's lifetime. Insurance companies are also known to question whether the most advanced prosthetics are -medically necessary.‖ Herr believes that insurance providers need to radically rethink their cost-benefit analyses. Although the latest bionic prosthetics are more expensive per unit than less-complex devices, he argues, they reduce health care payouts across the lifetime of the patient. -When leg amputees use low-tech prostheses, they develop joint conditions, knee arthritis, hip arthritis, and they're on continual pain medication,‖ says Herr. -They don't walk that much because walking is difficult, and that drives cardiovascular disease and obesity.

More we talk about prosthetics, we must cover the topic of materials, as they also evolve during time and now technology talks about Biomaterials, to get the senses back to the amputee however, with this biomaterial they have strived to illustrate the versatility and potential of these materials. Indeed, one could postulate that the versatility of smart materials is limited only by the imaginations of their designers and by the scientists who use them. Interestingly, a recently published article discussing the -intelligence‖ of smart materials hypothesized that if current smart materials were rated using a standard IQ test, they would have an IQ of 2 -impressive for inanimate compounds. And researchers are continuing to develop smarter, more useful compounds.

While there are many bionic devices at various stages of commercialization, their adoption rates are modest, with the exception of robotic exoskeletons for rehabilitation. In North America, companies such as Advanced Bionics, ReWalk Robotics and Medtronic have been successful in increasing the large-scale adoption of bionic prosthetics, achieving impressive market penetration.


## Conclusion

The promising developments in lower-limb prostheses have allowedexperts to feel optimistic. With vast room forimprovement in lower-limb prostheses,it encourages researchgroups to include cutting-edge technologyin all prosthetic components. This paves the wayfor improvements in prosthetic fabricationas well as other fields thatrequire similar technology.The R&D of lower-limb prostheses demands multidisciplinary research that requires collaborative cross-field research. Myoelectric controlled prosthetic limbs, considered to be the most exciting developmentin the field, need incorporationof mechanical moving parts,electrical circuits, bioelectronics, andmaterial science. The myoelectric-controlledprosthetic limbs function by usingelectrical signals from the amputee'snerves to the prosthesis, similar to the natural leg. While lower-limb prosthetics are increasingly sophisticated, they need to balance implicitly, elegance and cost. Growth inthe number of manufacturers of theseprosthetics is seen throughout theworld. Every product that improvesthe usability and reliability for theamputee is a societal win-win. Extensive researchis underway on implantable stumps,which may eradicate the need for asocket. With parallel developments in nanotech, bioprinting, prosthetics, and robotics,superhuman-like body parts will nolonger be fantasia.

Most of these technologies require time. The field of bionic prosthetics is of continuous development and despite human desire over time especially since World War I, there has been no significant improvement until now. With availability of modern technologies and advancement in the field of biomedical engineering, new possibilities are being discovered. The devising of replacement limbs with real lifelike capabilities is a reachable dream. Various articles talk about such discoveries and challenges that are being faced by researchers.

The future development of prostheses will depend greatly on demand. The market for low cost, limited function devices will continue to expand to meet the needs of the developing world, as well as the funding restrictions common in all economies. Innovative technologies will continue to be adapted from the aerospace and computer industries. Their application to high performance artificial limbs, will create Licensed Under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY more natural limb function. Currently, prosthetic innovations are used sparingly, primarily by amputees with private funding, particularly those who are competitive athletes. As research continues, manufacturers will apply the same principles reducing cost less active individuals in the greater market. The performance of prosthesis, particularly bionics will improve as a result. Furthermore, newer materials, high power nanotech and applications will be used for the benefit of amputees in developing countries, despite differences in the cause of amputation and people's needs. Financial constraints limit the rate of advancement in prosthetics, and one of the greatest challenges for the new millennium will be to find the will and the way to fund widespread application of prosthetic innovations. Our analysis shows the trade-offs required to balance performance, cost and aesthetics for future prosthetics bionic product development. The notional decision model that was developed shows the movement of cost vs. performance value. As the cost impact increases (moving right) higher performance and more costly solutions become lower in total value. See Figure 5 below.


## Figure 5: Cost Sensitivity on Prosthetic Total Value

The real challenge for prosthetic product development will be to balance cost and performance not only in materials, but also in improved prosthetic mechanism employment.
