What are the characteristics of BERT's contextualized embeddings?

Answer:

Unlike conventional static embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Pennington et al., 2014), BERT's representations are contextualized, meaning every input token is represented by a vector dependent on the particular context of occurrence.

Wiedemann et al. (2019) find that BERT's contextualized embeddings form distinct and clear clusters corresponding to word senses, which confirms that the basic distributional hypothesis holds for these representations.

Ethayarajh (2019) also find that BERT embeddings occupy a narrow cone in the vector space, and this effect increases from lower to higher layers.","BERT's contextualized embeddings have several key characteristics:

1. **Context-Awareness**: Unlike traditional word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe, which generate a single static vector for each word, BERT produces different embeddings for a word based on the context in which it appears. This means that the same word can have different embeddings in different sentences.

2. **Bidirectional Encoding**: BERT uses a bidirectional transformer architecture, which means it takes into account both the left and right context of a word simultaneously. This allows BERT to capture more nuanced meanings of words based on their surrounding words.

3. **Deep Representations**: BERT's embeddings are derived from multiple layers of transformer encoders. Each layer captures different levels of abstraction, from surface-level features in the lower layers to more complex, high-level features in the upper layers.

4. **Pre-trained and Fine-tuned**: BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text using unsupervised learning objectives like masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. These pre-trained embeddings can then be fine-tuned on specific tasks, allowing BERT to adapt to a wide range of NLP applications.

5. **Token-Level Embeddings**: BERT operates at the token level, which includes subword units. This allows it to handle out-of-vocabulary words and morphological variations more effectively.

6. **Dynamic and Task-Specific**: The embeddings generated by BERT can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, making them highly adaptable. This means that the same pre-trained BERT model can be used for various NLP tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition, with task-specific fine-tuning.

These studies often involve tasks such as subject-verb agreement, handling of nested clauses, and other syntactic phenomena.

What are the different types of attention heads identified in BERT models?

Answer:

None","In BERT models, attention heads are mechanisms within the multi-head self-attention layers that allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when making predictions. Researchers have identified several types of attention heads based on their behavior and the patterns they exhibit. Some of the commonly identified types of attention heads in BERT models include:

1. **Positional Heads**: These heads focus on specific positions in the input sequence, such as the beginning or end of a sentence. They help the model understand the structure and order of the sequence.

2. **Syntactic Heads**: These heads capture syntactic relationships between words, such as subject-verb or noun-adjective relationships. They help the model understand the grammatical structure of the sentence.

3. **Semantic Heads**: These heads focus on capturing semantic relationships and meanings between words. They help the model understand the context and meaning of the sentence.

4. **Local Heads**: These heads attend to nearby tokens, capturing local dependencies and relationships within a small window of the input sequence.

5. **Global Heads**: These heads attend to tokens across the entire input sequence, capturing long-range dependencies and relationships.

6. **Copying Heads**: These heads tend to copy information from one part of the sequence to another, which can be useful for tasks like sequence-to-sequence generation.

These types of attention heads contribute to the overall performance of BERT by allowing it to capture a wide range of linguistic and contextual information from the input sequence.",What are the different types of attention heads identified in BERT models based on their behavior and patterns?,What are the different types of attention heads identified in BERT models based on their behavior and patterns?,,"Questions:

sent14: The datasets and methods used in these studies differ, but they both find that there are heads that attend to words in obj role more than the positional baseline.
sent15: The evidence for nsubj, advmod, and amod has some variation between these two studies.
sent16: The overall conclusion is also supported by Voita et al. (2019)'s data for the base Transformer in machine translation context.
sent17: Hoover et al. (2019) hypothesize that even complex dependencies like dobj are encoded by a combination of heads rather than a single head, but this work is limited to qualitative analysis.Both Clark et al. (2019) and Htut et al. (2019) conclude that no single head has the complete syntactic tree information, in line with evidence of partial knowledge of syntax (see subsection 4.1).
sent18: present evidence that attention weights are weak indicators of subjectverb agreement and reflexive anafora.
sent19: Instead of serving as strong pointers between tokens that should be related, BERT's self-attention weights were close to a uniform attention baseline, but there was some sensitivity to different types of distractors coherent with psycholinguistic data.
sent20: Clark et al. (2019) identify a BERT head that can be directly used as a classifier to perform coreference resolution on par with a rule-based system,.
sent21: Kovaleva et al. (2019) showed that even when attention heads specialize in tracking semantic relations, they do not necessarily contribute to BERT's performance on relevant tasks.
sent22: Kovaleva et al. (2019) identified two heads of base BERT, in which self-attention maps were closely aligned with annotations of core frame semantic relations (Baker et al., 1998).
sent23: Although such relations should have been instrumental to tasks such as inference, a head ablation study showed that these heads were not essential for BERT's success on GLUE tasks.","# QUA Analysis:

What are the main challenges in conversational machine comprehension (CMC)?

The major challenges in conversational machine comprehension (CMC) include the need for the encoding module to encode not only P and A_i but also the conversational history.

The model is thus expected to capture these focal shifts during a conversation and reason pragmatically, instead of only matching lexically or via paraphrasing.

The model should, therefore, be able to take context from history which may or may not be immediate.","The main challenges in conversational machine comprehension (CMC) include:

1. **Context Understanding**: Maintaining and understanding the context over multiple turns in a conversation. This involves tracking entities, topics, and the flow of dialogue to provide coherent and relevant responses.

2. **Ambiguity Resolution**: Handling ambiguous questions or statements that may arise due to the conversational nature of the interaction. This requires the system to ask clarifying questions or make educated guesses based on context.

3. **Coreference Resolution**: Identifying and resolving references to entities mentioned earlier in the conversation. This is crucial for maintaining coherence and understanding who or what is being referred to at any point in the dialogue.

4. **Ellipsis Handling**: Understanding and completing sentences where parts of the information are omitted because they are implied by the context. This is common in natural conversation and requires the system to infer missing information.

5. **User Intent Recognition**: Accurately identifying the user's intent, which can be challenging due to the varied and sometimes indirect ways users express their needs in conversation.

6. **Knowledge Integration**: Incorporating external knowledge and facts into the conversation to provide accurate and informative responses. This involves accessing and integrating information from databases, the web, or other resources.

7. **Natural Language Generation**: Producing natural, fluent, and contextually appropriate responses. This requires advanced language generation capabilities to ensure the responses are not only correct but also sound natural and engaging.

8. **Error Handling and Recovery**: Effectively managing misunderstandings, errors, or unexpected inputs in the conversation. This includes strategies for gracefully recovering from mistakes and keeping the conversation on track.

9. **Personalization**: Tailoring responses to individual users based on their preferences, history, and context. This adds an additional layer of complexity as the system needs to remember and adapt to user-specific information.

10. **Scalability and Real-time Processing**: Ensuring the system can handle a large number of users and conversations simultaneously while providing real-time responses. This requires efficient algorithms and robust infrastructure.

There are four major components of the framework, based on their contribution to the overall CMC flow.",,"Questions:

What are the main components of a typical Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC) model?

Answer:

None","The main components of a typical Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC) model generally include:

1. **Input Representation**: This involves encoding the input text, which includes the conversation history and the current question. Techniques such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, GPT) are commonly used.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: This component processes the encoded input to understand the context of the conversation. It often involves using deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), or Transformer-based models to capture the dependencies and relationships within the text.

3. **Attention Mechanism**: Attention mechanisms help the model focus on relevant parts of the input text when generating a response. This is crucial for understanding which parts of the conversation history and the current question are most important.

4. **Answer Extraction or Generation**: Depending on the type of CMC model, this component either extracts the answer from the given text (extractive models) or generates a response (generative models). Extractive models typically use techniques like span prediction, while generative models might use sequence-to-sequence architectures.

5. **Post-processing**: This step involves refining the model's output to ensure it is coherent and contextually appropriate. It may include tasks like re-ranking candidate answers, ensuring grammatical correctness, and maintaining conversational flow.

6. **Training and Fine-tuning**: The model is trained and fine-tuned on large datasets of conversational data to improve its performance. This involves optimizing the model's parameters using techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent.

These components work together to enable a CMC model to understand and respond to questions within the context of an ongoing conversation.",What are the key elements involved in the architecture of a typical Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC) model?,What are the main components typically found in a Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC) model?,,"Questions:

What is the role of the encoder in a Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC) model?

Answer:

None","In a Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC) model, the role of the encoder is to transform the input text, which typically includes both the context (passage) and the question, into a set of meaningful representations. These representations capture the semantic and syntactic information of the input text, making it easier for the subsequent layers of the model to understand and process the information.

The encoder typically uses techniques such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformer architectures to convert the input text into a high-dimensional vector space. This encoded representation is then used by the decoder or other components of the model to generate the appropriate response or to extract the relevant information needed to answer the question.

(p3.2) Unsupervised Constituency Parsing Constituency parsing aims to discover a constituency tree of the input sentence in which the leaf nodes are words and the non-leaf nodes (nonterminal nodes) represent phrases. Unsupervised constituency parsing is often considered more difficult than unsupervised dependency parsing because it has to induce not only edges but also nodes of a tree. Consequently, there have been far more papers in unsupervised dependency parsing than in unsupervised constituency parsing over the past decade.

(p3.3) Latent Tree Models with Downstream Tasks Latent tree models treat the parse tree as a latent variable that is used in downstream tasks such as sentiment classification. While no treebank is used in training, these models rely on the performance of the downstream tasks to guide the learning of the latent parse trees. To enable end-to-end learning, the REINFORCE algorithm and the Gumbel-softmax trick (Jang et al., 2017) can be utilized (Yogatama et al., 2016;Choi et al., 2018). There also exists previous work on latent dependency tree models that utilizes structured attention mechanisms (Kim et al., 2017) for applications. Latent tree models differ from unsupervised parsing in that they utilize training signals from downstream tasks and that they aim to improve performance of downstream tasks instead of syntactic parsing.

What are the main differences between supervised and unsupervised dependency parsing?

Answer:

Supervised dependency parsing aims to train a dependency parser from training sentences that are manually annotated with their dependency parse trees.

While current state-of-the-art approaches have achieved strong results in supervised dependency parsing, their usefulness is limited to resource-rich languages and domains with many annotated datasets.

Unsupervised parsing is more challenging because it does not have access to any source treebank either.","The main differences between supervised and unsupervised dependency parsing are:

1. **Training Data**:
   - **Supervised Dependency Parsing**: Requires a labeled dataset where the syntactic structure of sentences is annotated. This means that the training data includes sentences with their corresponding dependency trees.
   - **Unsupervised Dependency Parsing**: Does not require labeled data. Instead, it relies on raw, unannotated text and uses algorithms to infer the syntactic structure without explicit annotations.

2. **Accuracy and Performance**:
   - **Supervised Dependency Parsing**: Generally achieves higher accuracy and better performance because it learns from explicit examples of correct syntactic structures.
   - **Unsupervised Dependency Parsing**: Typically has lower accuracy compared to supervised methods because it has to infer the structure without direct guidance from labeled examples.

3. **Algorithm Complexity**:
   - **Supervised Dependency Parsing**: Often involves complex machine learning models that can leverage the rich information provided by the labeled data.
   - **Unsupervised Dependency Parsing**: Relies on probabilistic models, clustering, or other heuristic methods to discover patterns in the data, which can be more challenging and less straightforward.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - **Supervised Dependency Parsing**: Preferred in scenarios where labeled data is available and high accuracy is crucial, such as in well-resourced languages and applications requiring precise syntactic analysis.
   - **Unsupervised Dependency Parsing**: Useful in low-resource settings where labeled data is scarce or unavailable, and for exploratory analysis where the goal is to uncover underlying structures without prior annotations.

5. **Development and Maintenance**:
   - **Supervised Dependency Parsing**: Requires ongoing efforts to create and maintain annotated corpora, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
   - **Unsupervised Dependency Parsing**: Reduces the need for annotated data, making it more scalable to new languages and domains, but may require more sophisticated algorithms to achieve reasonable performance.

In summary, supervised dependency parsing relies on labeled data and generally provides higher accuracy, while unsupervised dependency parsing works with raw text and is more flexible but typically less accurate.",What are the main goals and challenges of supervised versus unsupervised dependency parsing?,What are the main differences between supervised and unsupervised dependency parsing in terms of training data and applicability to resource-rich languages?,"Supervised dependency parsing relies on training sentences that are manually annotated with their dependency parse trees, making it effective primarily in resource-rich languages and domains with many annotated datasets.

The generation of a child token is conditioned on the head token and the dependency direction. In contrast, Klein and Manning (2004) propose the Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) that generates the sentence and the parse tree simultaneously. Without knowing the dependency tree structure, each head token has to sample a decision (conditioned on the head token and the dependency direction) of whether to generate a child token or not before actually generating the child token.

Yang et al. (2020) propose a second-order extension of DMV that incorporates grandparent-child or sibling information.","Unsupervised dependency parsing aims to infer the syntactic structure of sentences without labeled training data. Various generative models have been proposed for this task, each with distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between some of the prominent generative models:

1. **Dependency Model with Valence (DMV)**:
   - **Structure**: The DMV is a probabilistic model that generates parse trees by recursively generating child nodes (dependencies) for each word.
   - **Valence**: It incorporates valence, which refers to the number of children a node can have, distinguishing between generating the first child and subsequent children.
   - **Parameterization**: The model parameters include probabilities for choosing whether to generate a child and probabilities for selecting specific words as children.

2. **Extended Valence Models**:
   - **Structure**: These models extend the basic DMV by incorporating additional linguistic features or constraints.
   - **Valence**: They may include more detailed valence distinctions, such as differentiating between left and right children or incorporating more complex dependency structures.
   - **Parameterization**: These models often have more parameters to capture the additional features, which can improve parsing accuracy but also increase complexity.

3. **Bayesian Models**:
   - **Structure**: Bayesian models introduce prior distributions over the parameters of the generative process, allowing for more flexible and robust learning.
   - **Valence**: They can incorporate valence in a similar way to DMV but with priors that can encode linguistic biases or preferences.
   - **Parameterization**: The use of priors helps in regularizing the model, potentially leading to better generalization, especially with limited data.

4. **Neural Generative Models**:
   - **Structure**: These models use neural networks to parameterize the generative process, often leveraging embeddings and deep learning techniques.
   - **Valence**: Neural models can implicitly capture valence and other syntactic properties through learned representations.
   - **Parameterization**: They typically have a large number of parameters and require substantial computational resources for training. However, they can capture complex dependencies and generalize well across different languages and domains.

5. **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)-Based Models**:
   - **Structure**: CFG-based models generate parse trees using context-free grammar rules, which can be probabilistic.
   - **Valence**: Valence is not explicitly modeled but can be indirectly captured through the grammar rules.
   - **Parameterization**: These models rely on the probabilities of grammar rules, which can be learned from data. They are often simpler than neural models but may struggle with capturing long-range dependencies.

6. **Lexicalized Models**:
   - **Structure**: Lexicalized models incorporate lexical information (specific words) into the generative process, often leading to more accurate parsing.
   - **Valence**: They can model valence more precisely by considering the lexical context of each word.
   - **Parameterization**: These models have more parameters due to the inclusion of lexical information, which can improve performance but also increase the risk of overfitting.

In summary, the key differences between various generative models for unsupervised dependency parsing lie in their structure, how they handle valence, and their parameterization. Each model has its strengths and trade-offs, with simpler models like DMV being easier to train and interpret, while more complex models like neural generative models offer higher accuracy and flexibility at the cost of increased computational requirements.",What are the key differences in the generation processes of various generative models for unsupervised dependency parsing based on their independence assumptions?,What are the key differences in the generation processes of various generative models for unsupervised dependency parsing?,"Different generative models for unsupervised dependency parsing specify different generation processes of the sentence and parse tree based on their respective independence assumptions.

Spitkovsky et al. (2013) propose to treat different learning algorithms and configurations as modules and connect them to form a network.","Improving learning results in unsupervised dependency parsing can be challenging due to the lack of labeled data. However, several methods and strategies can be employed to enhance performance:

1. **Initialization Techniques**: Using better initialization methods can significantly impact the performance of unsupervised models. For example, leveraging pre-trained word embeddings or using linguistic priors can provide a good starting point.

2. **Inductive Biases**: Incorporating linguistic knowledge or biases into the model can guide the learning process. This can include constraints based on universal grammar principles or language-specific rules.

3. **Multi-lingual Learning**: Training models on multiple languages simultaneously can help in transferring knowledge across languages, especially if they share syntactic similarities. This approach can leverage commonalities to improve parsing accuracy.

4. **Semi-supervised Learning**: Combining a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data can help improve the model's performance. Techniques like self-training, co-training, or using labeled data to fine-tune unsupervised models can be effective.

5. **Data Augmentation**: Generating synthetic data or augmenting existing data can help the model learn better. Techniques like back-translation or paraphrasing can create additional training examples.

6. **Model Architecture**: Using more sophisticated model architectures, such as neural networks with attention mechanisms, can capture more complex dependencies and improve parsing results.

7. **Regularization Techniques**: Applying regularization methods to prevent overfitting and encourage the model to learn more generalizable patterns can be beneficial. Techniques like dropout, weight decay, or variational inference can be used.

8. **Evaluation and Iteration**: Continuously evaluating the model on a validation set and iterating on the model design and hyperparameters can lead to gradual improvements.

9. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining the outputs of multiple models can help in reducing errors and improving overall performance. Techniques like bagging, boosting, or stacking can be employed.

10. **Incorporating External Resources**: Utilizing external linguistic resources such as part-of-speech taggers, morphological analyzers, or syntactic databases can provide additional information that aids in parsing.

In the computer vision community, this is a popular approach where, e.g., rotating an image is invariant to the classification of an image's content. For text, on the token level, this can be done by replacing words with equivalents, such as synonyms (Wei and Zou, 2019), entities of the same type (Raiman and Miller, 2017;Dai and Adel, 2020) or words that share the same morphology (Gulordava et al., 2018;Vania et al., 2019). Such replacements can also be guided by a language model that takes context into consideration (Fadaee et al., 2017;Kobayashi, 2018)."", 'To go beyond the token level and add more diversity to the augmented sentences, data augmentation can also be performed on sentence parts. Operations that (depending on the task) do not change the label include manipulation of parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018;Vania et al., 2019;Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplification of sentences by removal of sentence parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018) and inversion of the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020). For whole sentences, paraphrasing through backtranslation can be used. This is a popular approach in machine translation where target sentences are back-translated into source sentences (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011;Hoang et al., 2018). An important aspect here is that errors in the source side/features do not seem to have a large negative effect on the generated target text the model needs to predict. It is therefore also used in other text generation tasks like abstract summarization (Parida and Motlicek, 2019) and table-to-text generation (Ma et al., 2019). Back-translation has also been leveraged for text classification (Xie et al., 2020;Hegde and Patil, 2020). This setting assumes, however, the availability of a translation system. Instead, a language model can also be used for augmenting text classification datasets (Kumar et al., 2020;Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020). It is trained conditioned on a label, i.e., on the subset of the task-specific data with this label. It then generates additional sentences that fit this label. Ding et al. (2020) extend this idea for token level tasks.', 'Adversarial methods are often used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020;Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020). They can, however, also be utilized to augment NLP datasets (Yasunaga et al., 2018;Morris et al., 2020). Instead of manually crafted transformation rules, these methods learn how to apply small perturbations to the input data that do not change the meaning of the text (according to a specific score).

1. **Synonym Replacement**: Replace words in the text with their synonyms using a thesaurus or word embeddings.

2. **Back Translation**: Translate the text to another language and then back to the original language to create a paraphrased version.

3. **Random Insertion**: Insert random words from the text into random positions within the text.

4. **Random Deletion**: Randomly remove words from the text.

5. **Random Swap**: Swap the positions of random words in the text.

6. **Noise Injection**: Add random noise to the text, such as misspellings or typographical errors.

7. **Text Generation**: Use models like GPT-3 to generate new text based on the existing data.

8. **Sentence Shuffling**: Shuffle the order of sentences in a document.

9. **Entity Replacement**: Replace named entities (like names, locations) with other entities of the same type.

10. **Contextual Augmentation**: Use language models to predict and replace words in the context of the sentence.

11. **Word Embedding Perturbation**: Slightly alter the word embeddings to create variations in the text.

12. **Adversarial Training**: Generate adversarial examples that are designed to challenge the model and improve its robustness.

These methods can help create a more diverse and comprehensive training dataset, leading to better generalization and performance of NLP models.",What are some token-level and sentence-level methods for data augmentation in NLP?,What are some token-level and sentence-level methods for data augmentation in NLP?,"For text data augmentation in NLP, token-level methods include replacing words with equivalents such as synonyms (Wei and Zou, 2019), entities of the same type (Raiman and Miller, 2017; Dai and Adel, 2020), or words that share the same morphology (Gulordava et al., 2018; Vania et al., 2019). These replacements can also be guided by a language model that takes context into consideration (Fadaee et al., 2017; Kobayashi, 2018).

On the sentence level, data augmentation can involve manipulating parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018; Vania et al., 2019; Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplifying sentences by removing parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018), or inverting the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020). Paraphrasing through backtranslation is another method, commonly used in machine translation and other text generation tasks (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011; Hoang et al., 2018; Parida and Motlicek, 2019; Ma et al., 2019). Back-translation has also been applied to text classification (Xie et al., 2020; Hegde and Patil, 2020).

Additionally, language models can be used to generate new sentences conditioned on a specific label for text classification datasets (Kumar et al., 2020; Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020), and this idea has been extended to token-level tasks (Ding et al., 2020).

Adversarial methods, typically used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020; Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020), can also be used for data augmentation by applying small perturbations that do not change the text's meaning (Yasunaga et al., 2018; Morris et al., 2020). For example, Grundkiewicz et al. (2019) applied transformations that flip the binary label to create new training data for a grammar correction task.","Questions:

What are some token-level and sentence-level methods for data augmentation in NLP?

Answer:

For text data augmentation in NLP, token-level methods include replacing words with equivalents such as synonyms (Wei and Zou, 2019), entities of the same type (Raiman and Miller, 2017; Dai and Adel, 2020), or words that share the same morphology (Gulordava et al., 2018; Vania et al., 2019). These replacements can also be guided by a language model that takes context into consideration (Fadaee et al., 2017; Kobayashi, 2018).

On the sentence level, data augmentation can involve manipulating parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018; Vania et al., 2019; Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplifying sentences by removing parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018), or inverting the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020). Paraphrasing through backtranslation is another method, commonly used in machine translation and other text generation tasks (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011; Hoang et al., 2018; Parida and Motlicek, 2019; Ma et al., 2019).

Adversarial methods, typically used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020; Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020), can also be used for data augmentation by applying small perturbations that do not change the text's meaning (Yasunaga et al., 2018; Morris et al., 2020).

Such replacements can also be guided by a language model that takes context into consideration (Fadaee et al., 2017; Kobayashi, 2018).

To go beyond the token level and add more diversity to the augmented sentences, data augmentation can also be performed on sentence parts.

Operations that do not change the label, depending on the task, include manipulation of parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018; Vania et al., 2019; Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplification of sentences by removal of sentence parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018), and inversion of the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020).

For whole sentences, paraphrasing through backtranslation can be used.

Back-translation has also been leveraged for text classification (Xie et al., 2020; Hegde and Patil, 2020).

Instead, a language model can also be used for augmenting text classification datasets (Kumar et al., 2020; Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020).

Adversarial methods are often used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020; Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020).

Adversarial methods can, however, also be utilized to augment NLP datasets (Yasunaga et al., 2018; Morris et al., 2020).","sent1: New instances can be obtained based on existing ones by modifying the features with transformations that do not change the label.
sent2: In the computer vision community, this is a popular approach where, e.g., rotating an image is invariant to the classification of an image's content.
sent3: For text, on the token level, this can be done by replacing words with equivalents, such as synonyms (Wei and Zou, 2019), entities of the same type (Raiman and Miller, 2017;Dai and Adel, 2020) or words that share the same morphology (Gulordava et al., 2018;Vania et al., 2019).
sent4: Such replacements can also be guided by a language model that takes context into consideration (Fadaee et al., 2017;Kobayashi, 2018).
sent5: To go beyond the token level and add more diversity to the augmented sentences, data augmentation can also be performed on sentence parts.
sent6: Operations that (depending on the task) do not change the label include manipulation of parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018;Vania et al., 2019;Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplification of sentences by removal of sentence parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018) and inversion of the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020).
sent7: For whole sentences, paraphrasing through backtranslation can be used.
sent8: This is a popular approach in machine translation where target sentences are back-translated into source sentences (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011;Hoang et al., 2018).
sent9: An important aspect here is that errors in the source side/features do not seem to have a large negative effect on the generated target text the model needs to predict.
sent10: It is therefore also used in other text generation tasks like abstract summarization (Parida and Motlicek, 2019) and table-to-text generation (Ma et al., 2019).
sent11: Back-translation has also been leveraged for text classification (Xie et al., 2020;Hegde and Patil, 2020).
sent12: This setting assumes, however, the availability of a translation system.
sent13: Instead, a language model can also be used for augmenting text classification datasets (Kumar et al., 2020;Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020).
sent14: It is trained conditioned on a label, i.e., on the subset of the task-specific data with this label.
sent15: It then generates additional sentences that fit this label.
sent16: Ding et al. (2020) extend this idea for token level tasks.
sent17: Adversarial methods are often used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020;Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020).
sent18: They can, however, also be utilized to augment NLP datasets (Yasunaga et al., 2018;Morris et al., 2020).
sent19: Instead of manually crafted transformation rules, these methods learn how to apply small perturbations to the input data that do not change the meaning of the text (according to a specific score).
sent20: This approach is often applied on the level of vector representations.
sent21: For instance, Grundkiewicz et al. (2019) reverse the augmentation setting by applying transformations that flip the (binary) label.
sent22: In their case, they introduce errors in correct sentences to obtain new training data for a grammar correction task.
sent23: Open Issues: While data augmentation is ubiquitous in the computer vision community and while most of the above-presented approaches are taskindependent, it has not found such widespread use in natural language processing.
sent24: A reason might be that several of the approaches require an indepth understanding of the language.
sent25: There is not yet a unified framework that allows applying data augmentation across tasks and languages.
sent26: Recently, Longpre et al. (2020) hypothesised that data augmentation provides the same benefits as pretraining in transformer models.
sent27: However, we argue that data augmentation might be better suited to leverage the insights of linguistic or domain experts in low-resource settings when unlabeled data or hardware resources are limited.","1. (What is data augmentation in NLP?): sent1

Distant & Weak Supervision##
In contrast to data augmentation, distant or weak supervision uses unlabeled text and keeps it unmodified. The corresponding labels are obtained through a (semi-)automatic process from an external source of information. For named entity recognition (NER), a list of location names might be obtained from a dictionary and matches of tokens in the text with entities in the list are automatically labeled as locations. Distant supervision was introduced by Mintz et al. (2009) for relation extraction (RE) with extensions on multi-instance (Riedel et al., 2010) and multi-label learning (Surdeanu et al., 2012). It is still a popular approach for information extraction tasks like NER and RE where the external information can be obtained from knowledge bases, gazetteers, dictionaries and other forms of structured knowledge sources (Luo et al., 2017;Hedderich and Klakow, 2018;Deng and Sun, 2019;Alt et al., 2019;Ye et al., 2019;Lange et al., 2019a;Nooralahzadeh et al., 2019;Le and Titov, 2019;Cao et al., 2019;Lison et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2021a). The automatic annotation ranges from simple string matching  to complex pipelines including classifiers and manual steps (Norman et al., 2019). This distant supervision using information from external knowledge sources can be seen as a subset of the more general approach of labeling rules. These encompass also other ideas like reg-ex rules or simple programming functions (Ratner et al., 2017;Zheng et al., 2019;Adelani et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2020;Lison et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020;Karamanolakis et al., 2021).

While distant supervision is popular for information extraction tasks like NER and RE, it is less prevalent in other areas of NLP. Nevertheless, distant supervision has also been successfully em-  (2020) build a discourse-structure dataset using guidance from sentiment annotations. For topic classification, heuristics can be used in combination with inputs from other classifiers like NER (Bach et al., 2019) or from entity lists (Hedderich et al., 2020). For some classification tasks, the labels can be rephrased with simple rules into sentences. A pretrained language model then judges the label sentence that most likely follows the unlabeled input (Opitz, 2019;). An unlabeled review, for instance, might be continued with ""It was great/bad"" for obtaining binary sentiment labels.

Open Issues: The popularity of distant supervision for NER and RE might be due to these tasks being particularly suited. There, auxiliary data like entity lists is readily available and distant supervision often achieves reasonable results with simple surface form rules. It is an open question whether a task needs to have specific properties to be suitable for this approach. The existing work on other tasks and the popularity in other fields like image classification (Xiao et al., 2015;Li et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2018;Mahajan et al., 2018; suggests, however, that distant supervision could be leveraged for more NLP tasks in the future.

Distant supervision methods heavily rely on auxiliary data. In a low-resource setting, it might be difficult to obtain not only labeled data but also such auxiliary data. Kann et al. (2020) find a large gap between the performance on high-resource and low-resource languages for POS tagging pointing to the lack of high-coverage and error-free dictionaries for the weak supervision in low-resource languages. This emphasizes the need for evaluating such methods in a realistic setting and avoiding to just simulate restricted access to labeled data in a high-resource language.

While distant supervision allows obtaining labeled data more quickly than manually annotating every instance of a dataset, it still requires human interaction to create automatic annotation techniques or to provide labeling rules.

While it has been useful in reducing the need for manually labeled data, it comes with several challenges and limitations:

1. **Noisy Labels**: The primary challenge of distant supervision is the introduction of noisy labels. The alignment process can be imperfect, leading to incorrect or ambiguous labels that can degrade the performance of the model.

2. **Incomplete Knowledge Bases**: Knowledge bases used for distant supervision are often incomplete or outdated. This can result in missing labels for relevant instances, which can affect the comprehensiveness of the training data.

3. **Contextual Ambiguity**: Distant supervision often fails to capture the context in which a piece of information is mentioned. This can lead to incorrect labeling when the same entity or relationship is used in different contexts.

4. **Scalability Issues**: While distant supervision can generate large amounts of labeled data, the quality of this data may not scale proportionally. As the dataset grows, the proportion of noisy or irrelevant labels can increase, making it harder to train effective models.

5. **Domain Adaptation**: Models trained with distantly supervised data may not generalize well to different domains or text genres. The distribution of entities and relationships in the knowledge base may not match those in the target domain.

6. **Dependency on Knowledge Base Quality**: The effectiveness of distant supervision heavily depends on the quality and coverage of the knowledge base. Poorly curated or biased knowledge bases can lead to biased or inaccurate models.

7. **Evaluation Challenges**: Evaluating the performance of models trained with distantly supervised data can be difficult. The presence of noisy labels complicates the assessment of true model performance, requiring more sophisticated evaluation metrics and methods.

8. **Complexity of Relationships**: Distant supervision often struggles with capturing complex or nuanced relationships between entities. Simple alignment methods may not be sufficient for more intricate relationships, leading to oversimplified models.

Addressing these challenges often requires additional techniques such as noise reduction methods, better alignment algorithms, and the incorporation of human-in-the-loop approaches to improve the quality of the labeled data.","What are the challenges and limitations of using distant supervision for NLP tasks, particularly in low-resource settings?","What are the challenges and limitations of using distant supervision for NLP tasks, especially in low-resource settings?","Distant supervision methods heavily rely on auxiliary data, which can be challenging to obtain in low-resource settings.

2 What is Stance?

In order to understand the task of stance detection, we first provide definitions of stance and the stance-taking process. Biber and Finegan (1988) define stance as the expression of a speaker's standpoint and judgement towards a given proposition. Further, Du Bois (2007)) define stance as ""a public act by a social actor, achieved dialogically through overt communicative means, of simultaneously evaluating objects, positioning subjects (self and others), and aligning with other subjects, with respect to any salient dimension of the sociocultural field"", showing that the stance-taking process is affected not only by personal opinions, but also by other external factors such as cultural norms, roles in the institution of the family, etc. Here, we adopt the general definition of stance detection by Küçük and Can (2020): ""for an input in the form of a piece of text and a target pair, stance detection is a classification problem where the stance of the author of the text is sought in the form of a category label from this set: Favor, Against, Neither.

Note that the stance detection definitions and the label inventories vary somewhat, depending on the target application (see Section 3).

Finally, stance detection can be distinguished from several other closely related NLP tasks: (i) biased language detection, where the existence of an inclination or tendency towards a particular perspective within a text is explored, (ii) emotion recognition, where the goal is to recognise emotions such as love, anger, etc. in the text, (iii) perspective identification, which aims to find the pointof-view of the author (e.g., Democrat vs. Republican) and the target is always explicit, (iv) sarcasm detection, where the interest is in satirical or ironic pieces of text, often written with the intent of ridicule or mockery, and (v) sentiment analysis, which checks the polarity of a piece of text.",True,"

What are the key characteristics of stance detection datasets for mis- and disinformation detection?

Answer:

None","The key characteristics of stance detection datasets for mis- and disinformation detection typically include:

1. **Labeling of Stance**: Each data point is labeled with a stance category, such as ""support,"" ""oppose,"" ""neutral,"" or ""unrelated."" This helps in identifying the position of the text concerning a particular claim or topic.

2. **Diverse Sources**: The datasets often include text from various sources like news articles, social media posts, blogs, and forums to capture a wide range of perspectives and writing styles.

3. **Claim-Text Pairs**: The datasets usually consist of pairs of claims and corresponding texts. The text is analyzed to determine its stance towards the given claim.

4. **Annotation Quality**: High-quality annotations are crucial. This often involves multiple annotators and inter-annotator agreement checks to ensure reliability and accuracy of the stance labels.

5. **Contextual Information**: Some datasets provide additional contextual information, such as metadata about the source, publication date, and author, which can be useful for more nuanced analysis.

6. **Balanced Representation**: Efforts are made to ensure a balanced representation of different stances to avoid bias in the training data, which is crucial for developing robust stance detection models.

7. **Multilingual Data**: In some cases, datasets include texts in multiple languages to support the development of stance detection systems that can operate in different linguistic contexts.

8. **Temporal Information**: Including temporal information can help in understanding how stances evolve over time, which is particularly relevant for tracking the spread of mis- and disinformation.

9. **Rich Annotations**: Beyond stance labels, some datasets may include additional annotations such as sentiment, emotion, or credibility, which can provide deeper insights into the nature of the text.

10. **Public Availability**: Many stance detection datasets are publicly available to facilitate research and development in the field, often accompanied by detailed documentation and baseline results.

These characteristics help in creating comprehensive and effective datasets for training and evaluating stance detection models aimed at identifying and mitigating mis- and disinformation.",What are the essential features of stance detection datasets used for identifying mis- and disinformation?,What are the essential features of stance detection datasets used for identifying mis- and disinformation?,,"Questions:

One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance. Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead. In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help. Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful. All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance. In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general. This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.', ""Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents. Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t. the target claim."", 'More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.', 'Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help. In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree. The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings. For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT. Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets. Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).', 'Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER . To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted. The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021). Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score. Yet, the retrieval model is also important, e.g., using the gold evidence set adds 1.4 points. Liu et al. (2020b); Zhong et al. (2020) replaced the retrieval model with a BERT-based one, in addition to using an improved mechanism to propagate the information between nodes in the graph, boosting the score to 70. Recently, Ye et al. (2020) experimented with a retriever that incorporates co-reference in distantsupervised pre-training, namely, CorefRoBERTa.  added external knowledge to build a contextualized semantic graph, setting a new SOTA on Snopes. Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information. Atanasova et al. (2022) introduced the task of evidence sufficiency prediction to more reliably predict the NOT ENOUGH INFO class.', 'Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021). Such models do not require a retrieval step, as they use the knowledge stored in language models. However, they are prone to biases in the patterns used, e.g., they can predict date instead of city/country and vice-versa when using ""born in/on"". Moreover, the insufficient context can seriously confuse them, e.g., for short claims with uncommon words such as ""Sarawak is a ..."", where it is hard to detect the entity type. Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).', 'Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer."" vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club."", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers."" (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm."" is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.', 'Threaded Stance In the setting of conversational threads (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), in contrast to the single-task setup, which ignores or does not provide further context, important knowledge can be gained from the structure of user interactions.', ""These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours). A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017). Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets. More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020). Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1). Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph. Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection. Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task. Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification . Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019)."", 'A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0. Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1. Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class. On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).', 'Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.', 'Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness. However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.', 'Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance. Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models. They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets. Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.  They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios. Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance. Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1. The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc. Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets.']","In this section, we discuss various ways to use stance detection for mis-and disinformation detection, and list the state-of-the-art results in Table 2.

More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021). Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score.

Threaded Stance In the setting of conversational threads (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), in contrast to the single-task setup, which ignores or does not provide further context, important knowledge can be gained from the structure of user interactions.

These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours). A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017). Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets. More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020). Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1). Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph. Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection. Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task. Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification . Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019).

A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0. Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1. Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class. On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).

Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.

Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness. However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.

Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance. Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models. They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets. Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.  They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios. Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance. Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1. The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc. Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets.","(p6.0) In this section, we discuss various ways to use stance detection for mis-and disinformation detection, and list the state-of-the-art results in Table 2.

(p6.1) Fact-Checking as Stance Detection Here, we discuss approaches for stance detection in the context of mis-and disinformation detection, where veracity is modelled as stance detection as outlined in Section 3.1. One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance. Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead. In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help. Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful. All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance. In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general. This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.

(p6.2) Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents. Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t. the target claim.

(p6.3) More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.

(p6.4) Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help. In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree. The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings. For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT. Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets. Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).

(p6.5) Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER . To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted. The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021). Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score.

Recently, Ye et al. (2020) experimented with a retriever that incorporates co-reference in distantsupervised pre-training, namely, CorefRoBERTa.  added external knowledge to build a contextualized semantic graph, setting a new SOTA on Snopes. Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information. Atanasova et al. (2022) introduced the task of evidence sufficiency prediction to more reliably predict the NOT ENOUGH INFO class.

(p6.6) Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021). Such models do not require a retrieval step, as they use the knowledge stored in language models. However, they are prone to biases in the patterns used, e.g., they can predict date instead of city/country and vice-versa when using ""born in/on"".

Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).

(p6.7) Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer."" vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club."", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers."" (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm."" is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.

Multiple languages##
In this section, we discuss various ways to use stance detection for mis-and disinformation detection, and list the state-of-the-art results in Table 2.

Fact-Checking as Stance Detection Here, we discuss approaches for stance detection in the context of mis-and disinformation detection, where veracity is modelled as stance detection as outlined in Section 3.1. One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance. Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead. In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help. Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful. All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance. In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general. This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.

Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents. Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t. the target claim.

More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help. In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree. The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings. For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT. Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets. Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).

Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER . To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted. The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021). Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score. Yet, the retrieval model is also important, e.g., using the gold evidence set adds 1.4 points. Liu et al. (2020b); Zhong et al. (2020) replaced the retrieval model with a BERT-based one, in addition to using an improved mechanism to propagate the information between nodes in the graph, boosting the score to 70. Recently, Ye et al. (2020) experimented with a retriever that incorporates co-reference in distantsupervised pre-training, namely, CorefRoBERTa.  added external knowledge to build a contextualized semantic graph, setting a new SOTA on Snopes. Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information. Atanasova et al. (2022) introduced the task of evidence sufficiency prediction to more reliably predict the NOT ENOUGH INFO class.

Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021). Such models do not require a retrieval step, as they use the knowledge stored in language models. However, they are prone to biases in the patterns used, e.g., they can predict date instead of city/country and vice-versa when using ""born in/on"". Moreover, the insufficient context can seriously confuse them, e.g., for short claims with uncommon words such as ""Sarawak is a ..."", where it is hard to detect the entity type. Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).

Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer."" vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club."", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers."" (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm."" is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.

Threaded Stance In the setting of conversational threads (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), in contrast to the single-task setup, which ignores or does not provide further context, important knowledge can be gained from the structure of user interactions.

These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours). A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017). Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets. More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020). Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1). Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph. Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection. Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task. Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification . Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019).

A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0. Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1. Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class. On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).

Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.

Here are some of the key challenges and recent advancements in this area:

### Challenges:

1. **Ambiguity and Subtlety**: Texts can be ambiguous or subtly worded, making it difficult to accurately determine the stance. Sarcasm, irony, and nuanced language further complicate this task.

2. **Context Dependence**: The stance of a text often depends heavily on the context in which it is presented. Without understanding the broader context, it can be challenging to accurately assess the stance.

3. **Diverse Sources and Formats**: Mis- and disinformation can come from a wide range of sources and in various formats (e.g., social media posts, news articles, videos). Stance detection models need to be adaptable to different types of content.

4. **Evolving Language and Topics**: Language and topics related to mis- and disinformation evolve rapidly. Models need to be continuously updated to handle new terms, phrases, and emerging topics.

5. **Bias and Fairness**: Ensuring that stance detection models are unbiased and fair is critical, especially when dealing with sensitive topics. Bias in training data can lead to skewed results.

### Recent Advancements:

1. **Transformer-based Models**: The use of transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-3 has significantly improved the performance of stance detection systems. These models can capture complex language patterns and contextual information more effectively than traditional methods.

2. **Multi-task Learning**: Approaches that involve multi-task learning, where a model is trained on multiple related tasks simultaneously, have shown promise. This can help the model generalize better and improve its ability to detect stance across different contexts.

3. **Domain Adaptation**: Techniques for domain adaptation, where models are fine-tuned on specific domains or types of content, have been developed to improve performance on diverse sources of mis- and disinformation.

4. **Explainability and Interpretability**: There is a growing focus on making stance detection models more explainable and interpretable. This helps in understanding the reasoning behind a model's predictions and in building trust with users.

5. **Cross-lingual and Multilingual Models**: Advances in cross-lingual and multilingual models have enabled stance detection systems to work across different languages, which is crucial for identifying mis- and disinformation in a global context.

6. **Integration with Fact-checking Systems**: Stance detection is increasingly being integrated with automated fact-checking systems. This combination helps in not only identifying the stance but also verifying the factual accuracy of the information.

In summary, while stance detection for mis- and disinformation identification faces several challenges, recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with transformer-based models and multi-task learning, are making significant strides in improving the accuracy and robustness of these systems.","What are the main challenges and recent advancements in stance detection for identifying mis- and disinformation, particularly in terms of semantic confusion, sensitivity to errors, and the use of pre-trained Transformers?","What are the main challenges and recent advancements in stance detection for identifying mis- and disinformation, particularly in terms of error analysis and the impact of pre-trained Transformers?","Error analysis in stance detection for identifying mis- and disinformation highlights several main challenges:

(2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents.
sent12: Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t.
sent13: the target claim. More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.
sent14: Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help.
sent15: In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree.
sent16: The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings.
sent17: For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT.
sent18: Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets.
sent19: Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).
sent20: Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER .
sent21: To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted.
sent22: The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021).
sent23: Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score.
sent24: Yet, the retrieval model is also important, e.g., using the gold evidence set adds 1.4 points.
sent25: Liu et al. (2020b); Zhong et al. (2020) replaced the retrieval model with a BERT-based one, in addition to using an improved mechanism to propagate the information between nodes in the graph, boosting the score to 70.
sent26: Recently, Ye et al. (2020) experimented with a retriever that incorporates co-reference in distantsupervised pre-training, namely, CorefRoBERTa.  added external knowledge to build a contextualized semantic graph, setting a new SOTA on Snopes.
sent27: Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information.
sent28: Atanasova et al. (2022) introduced the task of evidence sufficiency prediction to more reliably predict the NOT ENOUGH INFO class.
sent29: Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021).
sent30: Such models do not require a retrieval step, as they use the knowledge stored in language models.
sent31: However, they are prone to biases in the patterns used, e.g., they can predict date instead of city/country and vice-versa when using ""born in/on"".
sent32: Moreover, the insufficient context can seriously confuse them, e.g., for short claims with uncommon words such as ""Sarawak is a ..."", where it is hard to detect the entity type.
sent33: Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).
sent34: Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer.""
sent35: vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club.
sent36: "", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers.""
sent37: (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm.""
sent38: is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.
sent39: Threaded Stance In the setting of conversational threads (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), in contrast to the single-task setup, which ignores or does not provide further context, important knowledge can be gained from the structure of user interactions.
sent40: These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours).
sent41: A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017).
sent42: Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets.
sent43: More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020).
sent44: Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1).
sent45: Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph.
sent46: Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection.
sent47: Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task.
sent48: Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification .
sent49: Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019).
sent50: A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0.
sent51: Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1.
sent52: Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class.
sent53: On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).
sent54: Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.
sent55: Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness.
sent56: However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.
sent57: Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance.
sent58: Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models.
sent59: They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets.
sent60: Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.
sent61: They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios.
sent62: Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance.
sent63: Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1.
sent64: The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc.
sent65: Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets.","1. What is the focus of this section?

What are some examples of fine-grained truth labels used in fact-checking?

Answer:

None","Some examples of fine-grained truth labels used in fact-checking include:

1. **True**: The statement is accurate and supported by evidence.
2. **Mostly True**: The statement is largely accurate but may contain minor inaccuracies or require additional context.
3. **Half True**: The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
4. **Mostly False**: The statement contains some element of truth but is mostly inaccurate or misleading.
5. **False**: The statement is not accurate and lacks supporting evidence.
6. **Pants on Fire**: The statement is not only false but also ridiculously so.
7. **Misleading**: The statement may be technically true but is presented in a way that creates a false impression.
8. **Unverified**: The statement's accuracy cannot be determined due to a lack of available evidence.
9. **Outdated**: The statement was once true but is no longer accurate due to changes over time.
10. **Exaggerated**: The statement overstates the facts or the significance of the information.

What are some specific examples of fine-grained truth labels used in fact-checking?

Answer:

nan",,"sent1: The notion of shades of truth is important in mis-and disinformation detection.
sent2: For example, fact-checking often goes beyond binary true/false labels, e.g., Nakov et al. (2018) used a third category half-true, Rashkin et al. (2017) included mixed and no factual evidence, and Wang (2017); Santia and Williams (2018) adopted an even finer-grained schema with six labels, including barely true and utterly false.
sent3: We believe that such shades could be applied to stance and used in a larger pipeline.
sent4: In fact, fine-grained labels are common for the related task of Sentiment Analysis (Pang and Lee, 2005;Rosenthal et al., 2017).
sent5: Label Semantics As research in stance detection has evolved, so has the definition of the task and the label inventories, but they still do not capture the strength of the expressed stance.
sent6: As shown in Section 3 (also Appendix 2, labels can vary based on the use case and the setting they are used in. Most researchers have adopted a variant of the Favour, Against, and Neither labels, or an extended schema such as (S)upport, (Q)uery, (D)eny, and (C)omment (Mohammad et al., 2016), but that is not enough to accurately assess stance.
sent7: Moreover, adding label granularity can further improve the transfer between datasets, as the stance labels already share some semantic similarities, but there can be mismatches in the label definitions (Schiller et al., 2021;Hardalov et al., 2021Hardalov et al., , 2022.","# QUA Analysis:

   - Image content analysis (e.g., object detection, scene recognition)
   - Image metadata (e.g., EXIF data, image source)
   - Video content analysis (e.g., frame-by-frame analysis, deepfake detection)

   - User engagement metrics (e.g., likes, shares, comments)
   - Network features (e.g., propagation patterns, user influence)
   - User profiles (e.g., credibility, past behavior)

What are some recent efforts in fact-checking political debates?

Answer:

None","Recent efforts in fact-checking political debates have seen significant advancements, particularly with the integration of technology and collaboration among various organizations. Here are some notable efforts:

1. **Real-Time Fact-Checking Tools**: Several media organizations and tech companies have developed real-time fact-checking tools that analyze statements made during debates. For example, Google's Fact Check Explorer and Facebook's partnership with third-party fact-checkers aim to provide immediate verification of claims.

2. **Collaboration Among Fact-Checking Organizations**: Initiatives like the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) bring together fact-checkers from around the world to ensure accuracy and consistency in verifying political statements. These collaborations often result in comprehensive reports and databases of fact-checked claims.

3. **AI and Machine Learning**: Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled the development of sophisticated algorithms that can quickly cross-reference statements made during debates with existing databases of verified information. Projects like ClaimBuster and Full Fact's automated fact-checking tools are examples of this technology in action.

4. **Media Outlets' Fact-Checking Teams**: Major news organizations such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN have dedicated fact-checking teams that provide detailed analyses of political debates. These teams often publish their findings in real-time or shortly after the debates.

5. **Public Engagement and Education**: Efforts to engage the public in fact-checking have also increased. Platforms like PolitiFact and FactCheck.org not only provide fact-checks but also educate the public on how to discern factual information from misinformation.

These efforts collectively aim to enhance the accuracy of information disseminated during political debates and help the public make informed decisions.",What are some recent technological and collaborative efforts in fact-checking political debates?,What are some recent technological and collaborative efforts in fact-checking political debates?,,"Questions:

Why is text classification a popular task for explanation-based human debugging in NLP?

Answer:

Text classification is a popular task for explanation-based human debugging because it is much easier for lay participants to understand explanations and give feedback (Ghai et al., 2021).

Other NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and machine translation, require feedback providers to have linguistic knowledge.

The need for linguists or experts renders experiments for these tasks more difficult and costly.","Text classification is a popular task for explanation-based human debugging in NLP for several reasons:

1. **Interpretability**: Text classification tasks often involve assigning labels to text based on its content, which is relatively straightforward for humans to understand and interpret. This makes it easier for humans to follow and evaluate the reasoning behind the model's decisions.

2. **Error Analysis**: When a text classification model makes an error, it is usually easier to identify and understand the mistake by examining the input text and the assigned label. This facilitates the process of debugging and improving the model.

3. **Feature Importance**: Many techniques for explaining model predictions, such as attention mechanisms, feature importance scores, or saliency maps, can be effectively applied to text classification. These techniques help highlight which parts of the text influenced the model's decision, aiding in human debugging.

4. **Data Availability**: Text classification tasks often have well-defined datasets with clear labels, making it easier to collect and analyze data for debugging purposes. This abundance of labeled data supports the development and refinement of explanation methods.

5. **Application Relevance**: Text classification is widely used in various real-world applications, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization. The practical importance of these applications drives the need for reliable and interpretable models, making explanation-based debugging a valuable tool.

6. **Model Simplicity**: Compared to more complex NLP tasks like machine translation or text generation, text classification models are often simpler and more focused. This simplicity makes it easier to isolate and understand the factors contributing to model errors.

Overall, the combination of interpretability, ease of error analysis, effective explanation techniques, data availability, application relevance, and model simplicity makes text classification a popular and practical task for explanation-based human debugging in NLP.","Why is text classification a popular task for explanation-based human debugging in NLP, especially for lay participants?","Why is text classification a popular task for explanation-based human debugging in NLP, especially for lay participants?","Text classification is a popular task for explanation-based human debugging because it is much easier for lay participants to understand explanations and provide feedback, such as identifying which keywords should be added or removed from the list of top features (Ghai et al., 2021).

sent3: Ghai et al. (2021) suggested that most researchers work on TC because, for this task, it is much easier for lay participants to understand explanations and give feedback (e.g., which keywords should be added or removed from the list of top features) 4 .
sent4: Meanwhile, some other NLP tasks require the feedback providers to have linguistic knowledge such as part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and machine translation.
sent5: The need for linguists or experts renders experiments for these tasks more difficult and costly.
sent6: However, we suggest that there are several tasks where the trained models are prone to be buggy but the tasks are underexplored in the EBHD setting, though they are not too difficult to experiment on with lay people.
sent7: NLI, the focus of (Zylberajch et al., 2021), is one of them.
sent8: Indeed, McCoy et al. (2019) and Gururangan et al. (2018) showed that NLI models can exploit annotation artifacts and fallible syntactic heuristics to make predictions rather than learning the logic of the actual task.
sent9: Other tasks and their bugs include: QA, where Ribeiro et al. (2019) found that the answers from models are sometimes inconsistent (i.e., contradicting previous answers); and reading comprehension, where Jia and Liang (2017) showed that models, which answer a question by reading a given paragraph, can be fooled by an irrelevant sentence being appended to the paragraph.

What are the advantages of using Naive Bayes models for text classification in early NLP work?

Answer:

None","Naive Bayes models offer several advantages for text classification, especially in early Natural Language Processing (NLP) work:

1. **Simplicity and Ease of Implementation**: Naive Bayes is straightforward to implement and understand, making it an excellent choice for beginners and for rapid prototyping.

2. **Efficiency**: The model is computationally efficient, both in terms of training and prediction. This efficiency is particularly beneficial when working with large datasets, which are common in text classification tasks.

3. **Scalability**: Naive Bayes can handle a large number of features, which is typical in text data where each word can be considered a feature.

4. **Good Performance with Small Data**: Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well with relatively small amounts of training data, which can be advantageous in early stages of NLP projects.

5. **Handling of High-Dimensional Data**: Text data is inherently high-dimensional, and Naive Bayes can effectively manage this high dimensionality without requiring extensive feature engineering.

6. **Probabilistic Interpretation**: The model provides probabilistic outputs, which can be useful for understanding the confidence of predictions and for further decision-making processes.

7. **Robustness to Irrelevant Features**: Naive Bayes tends to be robust to irrelevant features, which means it can still perform well even if the dataset contains many non-informative words.

These advantages make Naive Bayes a popular choice for text classification tasks, particularly in the early stages of NLP work where simplicity, efficiency, and ease of implementation are crucial.","What are the key benefits of using Naive Bayes models for text classification, particularly in the initial stages of NLP projects?",What are the key benefits of using Naive Bayes models for text classification in the early stages of NLP projects?,,"Questions:

1. **Data Quality Issues**: Poor quality, noisy, or biased training data can lead to inaccurate models. This includes issues like misspellings, grammatical errors, and unrepresentative samples.

2. **Preprocessing Errors**: Mistakes in text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal can introduce bugs.

3. **Model Overfitting**: When a model is too complex, it may perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data, leading to overfitting.

4. **Underfitting**: Conversely, a model that is too simple may not capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to underfitting.

5. **Feature Engineering Mistakes**: Incorrectly engineered features or missing important features can degrade model performance.

6. **Algorithmic Bugs**: Errors in the implementation of the algorithms used for training and inference can introduce bugs.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Poor choices in hyperparameters can lead to suboptimal model performance.

8. **Evaluation Metrics**: Using inappropriate evaluation metrics can give misleading indications of model performance.

9. **Deployment Issues**: Bugs can be introduced during the deployment phase, such as differences between the training and production environments.

10. **External Dependencies**: Reliance on external libraries and APIs can introduce bugs if those dependencies have issues or change unexpectedly.

11. **Interpretation and Bias**: Misinterpretation of model outputs and inherent biases in the model can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions.

12. **Concurrency and Scalability**: Issues related to handling concurrent requests and scaling the model to handle large volumes of data can introduce bugs.

sent2: Out of the 15 papers we surveyed, 5 used the 20Newsgroups dataset (Lang, 1995) as a case study, since it has lots of natural artifacts.
sent3: For example, some punctuation marks appear more often in one class due to the writing styles of the authors contributing to the class, so the model uses these punctuation marks as clues to make predictions.
sent4: However, because 20Newsgroups is a topic classification dataset, a better model should focus more on the topic of the content since the punctuation marks can also appear in other classes, especially when we apply the model to texts in the wild.

Effective DA approaches should aim for a balance.","Data augmentation techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) aim to enhance the performance and robustness of models by artificially increasing the diversity and quantity of training data. Here are the primary goals and trade-offs associated with these techniques:

### Goals:
1. **Increase Data Diversity**: By generating varied examples, data augmentation helps models generalize better to unseen data.
2. **Improve Model Robustness**: Augmented data can expose models to a wider range of linguistic variations, making them more resilient to noise and unexpected inputs.
3. **Mitigate Overfitting**: More training data can help prevent the model from memorizing the training set, leading to better performance on validation and test sets.
4. **Compensate for Limited Data**: In scenarios where labeled data is scarce, augmentation can provide a cost-effective way to expand the dataset.
5. **Enhance Performance**: Ultimately, the goal is to improve the accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics of the NLP model.

### Trade-offs:
1. **Quality vs. Quantity**: While more data can be beneficial, poorly generated augmented data can introduce noise and degrade model performance.
2. **Computational Cost**: Generating and processing augmented data can be computationally expensive, requiring more resources and time.
3. **Complexity**: Implementing effective data augmentation techniques can add complexity to the data preprocessing pipeline.
4. **Risk of Overfitting to Augmented Data**: If the augmented data is too similar to the original data or not diverse enough, the model might overfit to the augmented dataset instead.
5. **Semantic Integrity**: Ensuring that the augmented data maintains the original semantic meaning is challenging. Poorly designed augmentation can lead to semantically incorrect or irrelevant data, confusing the model.
6. **Evaluation Challenges**: It can be difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques, as improvements in training metrics do not always translate to better real-world performance.

In summary, while data augmentation in NLP can significantly enhance model performance and robustness, it requires careful consideration of the trade-offs to ensure that the benefits outweigh the potential downsides.","What are the goals and trade-offs of implementing data augmentation techniques in NLP, and how do different approaches compare in terms of ease of implementation and performance improvement?","What are the goals and trade-offs of implementing data augmentation techniques in NLP, considering their ease of implementation and impact on model performance?","An ideal data augmentation (DA) technique in NLP should balance ease of implementation and improvement in model performance, serving as an alternative to collecting more data.

sent2: Most strategies either add slightly modified copies of existing data or create synthetic data, aiming for the augmented data to act as a regularizer and reduce overfitting when training ML models (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019;Hernández-García and König, 2020).
sent3: DA has been commonly used in CV, where techniques like cropping, flipping, and color jittering are a standard component of model training.
sent4: In NLP, where the input space is discrete, how to generate effective augmented examples that capture the desired invariances is less obvious.
sent5: What are the goals and trade-offs?
sent6: Despite challenges associated with text, many DA techniques for NLP have been proposed, ranging from rule-based manipulations (Zhang et al., 2015) to more complicated generative approaches (Liu et al., 2020b).
sent7: As DA aims to provide an alternative to collecting more data, an ideal DA technique should be both easy-to-implement and improve model performance.
sent8: Most offer trade-offs between these two.Rule-based techniques are easy-to-implement but usually offer incremental performance improvements (Li et al., 2017;Wei and Zou, 2019;Wei et al., 2021b).
sent9: Techniques leveraging trained models may be more costly to implement but introduce more data variation, leading to better performance boosts.
sent10: Model-based techniques customized for downstream tasks can have strong effects on performance but be difficult to develop and utilize.
sent11: Further, the distribution of augmented data should neither be too similar nor too different from the original.
sent12: This may lead to greater overfitting or poor performance through training on examples not representative of the given domain, respectively.
sent13: Effective DA approaches should aim for a balance.
sent14: Kashefi and Hwa (2020) devise a KL-Divergence-based unsupervised procedure to preemptively choose among DA heuristics, rather than a typical ""run-all-heuristics"" comparison, which can be very time and cost intensive.
sent15: Interpretation of DA Dao et al. (2019) note that ""data augmentation is typically performed in an adhoc manner with little understanding of the underlying theoretical principles"", and claim the typical explanation of DA as regularization to be insufficient.
sent16: Overall, there indeed appears to be a lack of research on why exactly DA works.
sent17: Existing work on this topic is mainly surface-level, and rarely investigates the theoretical underpinnings and principles.
sent18: We discuss this challenge more in §6, and highlight some of the existing work below.
sent19: Bishop (1995) show training with noised examples is reducible to Tikhonov regularization (subsumes L2).
sent20: Rajput et al. (2019) show that DA can increase the positive margin for classifiers, but only when augmenting exponentially many examples for common DA methods.
sent21: Dao et al. (2019) think of DA transformations as kernels, and find two ways DA helps: averaging of features and variance regularization.
sent22: Chen et al. (2020d) show that DA leads to variance reduction by averaging over orbits of the group that keep the data distribution approximately invariant.","1. (What is data augmentation?): sent1

Some common interpolation techniques include:

1. **Mixup**: This technique involves creating new training examples by taking a weighted average of two existing examples and their corresponding labels. For text, this might involve blending word embeddings or other feature representations.

2. **Manifold Mixup**: Similar to Mixup, but the interpolation is performed in a hidden layer of a neural network rather than on the input data. This can help the model learn more robust features.

3. **Back-Translation**: This involves translating a sentence to another language and then back to the original language. The resulting sentence is often slightly different from the original, providing a form of interpolation.

4. **Word Embedding Interpolation**: This technique involves interpolating between the word embeddings of two words to generate new embeddings that can be used to create synthetic sentences.

5. **Contextual Augmentation**: Using language models like BERT or GPT-3 to generate new sentences by predicting masked words or generating text based on a given context. This can be seen as a form of interpolation in the latent space of the language model.

These techniques help in creating diverse and enriched datasets, which can improve the generalization and robustness of NLP models.","What are some example interpolation techniques used in data augmentation for NLP, and how do they differ from each other?","What are some specific interpolation techniques used in data augmentation for NLP, including those that involve mixing embeddings or higher hidden layers?","Another class of data augmentation techniques, pioneered by MIXUP (Zhang et al., 2017), interpolates the inputs and labels of two or more real examples.

What are some rule-based data augmentation techniques for NLP?

Answer:

None","Rule-based data augmentation techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP) involve systematically altering the original text using predefined rules to create new, synthetic data samples. Some common rule-based techniques include:

1. **Synonym Replacement**: Replacing words with their synonyms using a thesaurus or a lexical database like WordNet.
2. **Random Insertion**: Inserting random words or phrases into the text, often using synonyms or related words.
3. **Random Deletion**: Removing words from the text at random to create a more concise version.
4. **Random Swap**: Swapping the positions of two words in the text to create a new sentence structure.
5. **Back Translation**: Translating the text to another language and then back to the original language to generate a paraphrased version.
6. **Text Shuffling**: Shuffling sentences or phrases within a text to create a new order while maintaining the overall meaning.
7. **Noise Injection**: Adding random noise, such as typos or grammatical errors, to the text to simulate real-world data imperfections.
8. **Entity Replacement**: Replacing named entities (e.g., names, locations) with other entities of the same type to create variations.
9. **Template-based Generation**: Using predefined templates to generate new sentences by filling in different words or phrases.

Automatic tools can take over some of the tasks that human moderators typically perform when monitoring online discussions. For example, in Social Sciences, one of the most discussed issues in crowd-scale deliberation is ""flaming"", i.e., aggressive and disrespectful communicative behavior (Lampe et al., 2014). Here, moderators could benefit from hate-speech and trolling detection methods in NLP. NLP methods to support deliberative decisionmaking have already been applied for the realtime visualisation of argument maps (El-Assady et al., 2017).

sent2: Automatic tools can take over some of the tasks that human moderators typically perform when monitoring online discussions.
sent3: For example, in Social Sciences, one of the most discussed issues in crowd-scale deliberation is ""flaming"", i.e., aggressive and disrespectful communicative behavior (Lampe et al., 2014).

sent5: NLP methods to support deliberative decisionmaking have already been applied for the realtime visualisation of argument maps (El-Assady et al., 2017).

sent11: Thus far, we have discussed the main ingredients of a rich NLP-informed approach to deliberative discourse.
sent12: These components, together with the deliberationaugmented definition of AQ sketched in section 3 are the features that the NLP moderator takes as an input.
sent13: One question remains open: How to represent the argumentative discourse within a contribution (e.g. a forum post) and across contributions (e.g. an entire online deliberation campaign)?
sent14: We can approach also this question from an interdisciplinary perspective.
sent15: Reference work in political science aims at modeling the mechanisms of political discourse in forms of discourse networks, as defined in Leifeld (2017).
sent16: A discourse network is a bipartite graph, containing two classes of nodes: actors (e.g. Angela Merkel; the left-wing party; etc.) and claims (e.g. housing opportunities should be established for refugees); Edges between actors and claims indicate the support or opposition of a certain actor to a specific claim.
sent17: Discourse coalitions (Hajer, 1993) and argumentative clusters are the projection of the affiliation network on the actor and claim sides of the network (Leifeld and Haunss, 2012;Haunss et al., 2013).
sent18: Recent NLP research has targeted integration machine learning in the discourse network analysis workflow (Padó et al., 2019;Haunss et al., 2020).
sent19: Crucially for AM, discourse networks can integrate claims and actors with a third class of nodes, the frame nodes, which encode the reason put forward by an actor to support or reject a claim.
sent20: This type of representation is perfectly compatible with a graph-based approach on argument representation which has already been established as to be preferred to a tree-structure representation both empirically (Niculae et al., 2017) and theoretically (Afantenos and Asher, 2014).
sent21: Moderation can thus be modeled as optimization of specific quantitative properties of the discourse network: participant inclusion, can be enforced by ensuring that the contributions of peripheric actor nodes receive the deserved salience; argument mapping and summarization can be modeled by identifying ""hot"" sub-graphs in the network; the impact of a contribution (the grounded notion of AQ we have been advocating thus far) can be quantified as the perturbation introduced in the network, with its long term effects on convergence or polarization.
sent22: Who moderates the (NLP) moderators?
sent23: The problem of biased moderation obviously relates to the issue of bias in NLP (Blodgett et al., 2020;Caliskan et al., 2017;Bolukbasi et al., 2016;Spliethöver and Wachsmuth, 2020) and it has a clear implication in the application of NLP methods to moderation.
sent24: For example, we would not want our NLP models to infer a negative impact on AQ from cues which just reveal that the user belongs to certain groups.
sent25: This is a real risk when quality is equated to ""success"", in turn quantified in terms of likes, replies, retweets.
sent26: The public of a forum may be sensitive to such cues, but the moderator should be unbiased with respect to them.
sent27: Another source of bias is the degree of literacy of a contribution: while users who express themselves poorly are likely to be less popular with the forum public, their contributions may still be a very good move in the ""cooperation challenge"" -one that moderators (NLP or humans, online or in-person) have to ensure will not be left unexploited.","# QUA Analysis:

236460206,Towards Argument Mining for Social Good: A Survey,"Computer Science, Linguistics, Political Science",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dcb0b23685c9c116d8d53fe47e5157753659d3bd,s5,Grounding AQ in deliberation: moderation as a real-world application,"['p5.0', 'p5.1', 'p5.2', 'p5.3', 'p5.4', 'p5.5', 'p5.6']","['Grounding AQ in a discourse perspective which quantifies ""team-playing"" and its impact on discourse dynamics is a clear challenge, both theoretically, in the Social Sciences and Argumentation Theory, and concretely, as the empirical quantification of discourse-grounded AQ will require large annotation efforts, real-time implementations, and thorough evaluation strategies. We propose to make a first step in tackling this challenge by mapping it into a concrete application: (semi-)automatic moderation implemented as a form of discourse optimization, or, as it is commonly referred to in the Social Sciences, facilitation (Kaner et al., 2007;Trénel, 2009). To illustrate the dynamics of moderation, let us start from concrete examples from a deliberation platform, RegulationRoom. This discussion forum has been employed by public institutions to gather citizens contributions on discussions targeting very heterogeneous issues (more details can be found in Appendix). Let us consider the following example from a discussion on the distracted driving by commercial vehicle operators (e.g., truckers and bus drivers). The posts we selected (arrows indicate comment nesting) are from the discussion sub-thread: Texting -what are the risks? 5 The example involves two users who clearly differ in their argumentation style and position. User 1 has a clear position on the topic (claim in bold: not just texting, but all cellphone interactions should be banned), which she/he supports with personal reports (underlined text) an emotional tone, and a style which is typical of social media text. User 2 replies, opening the post on a sarcastic note, which serves as the first premise to her/his (implicit) claim which is encoded in three rethorical questions (in bold): there should be no restrictions at all, because imposing them would be unfair. This is the case because (premises underlined): any distraction can cause an accident, some people are capable of using their phone while driving, people who spend lot of time in the car for professional reasons still need to communicate with loved ones. A moderator then joins the discussion to (a) provide a clarification as to why the focus is on texting and a link to further information on the matter, and (b) ask User 2 to elaborate on the personal communication issue, and to propose alternatives. In the Appendix we report another example from the same topic and thread, where the user acts as a problematizer, challenging the scope and definition of the rule under discussion and the moderator acts as a ""discourse traffic director"", pointing out that the user should read and contribute to different threads in the discussion.', ""The guidelines for human moderators in Reg-ulationRoom have been defined in advance in a 'moderator protocol' (eRulemaking Initiative et al., 2017) which reflect the moderator actions mentioned in the examples. In the protocol the moderator roles were divided into two main classes. Supervision functions include general moderator actions that do not necessarily target the specific content of the posts, e.g., greeting participants, monitoring compliance with netiquette (policing), or helping with technical difficulties. Substantive moderator functions aim to improve the quality of comments and promote fruitful discourse. As the examples above clearly show, this can both mean that the moderator encourages exchanges between discourse participants and participation in other posts (broadening the scope of the discussion), or helping users to improve the content of their posts (requests for clarification, focusing on one topic, substantive reasoning, sharing personal experiences)."", 'RegulationRoom represents an excellent example of the beneficial role of the moderator in maintaining productive argumentation from participants. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little to no NLP work targeting moderation modeling. Park et al.

We propose to make a first step in tackling this challenge by mapping it into a concrete application: (semi-)automatic moderation implemented as a form of discourse optimization, or, as it is commonly referred to in the Social Sciences, facilitation (Kaner et al., 2007;Trénel, 2009). To illustrate the dynamics of moderation, let us start from concrete examples from a deliberation platform, RegulationRoom. This discussion forum has been employed by public institutions to gather citizens contributions on discussions targeting very heterogeneous issues (more details can be found in Appendix). Let us consider the following example from a discussion on the distracted driving by commercial vehicle operators (e.g., truckers and bus drivers). The posts we selected (arrows indicate comment nesting) are from the discussion sub-thread: Texting -what are the risks? 5 The example involves two users who clearly differ in their argumentation style and position. User 1 has a clear position on the topic (claim in bold: not just texting, but all cellphone interactions should be banned), which she/he supports with personal reports (underlined text) an emotional tone, and a style which is typical of social media text. User 2 replies, opening the post on a sarcastic note, which serves as the first premise to her/his (implicit) claim which is encoded in three rethorical questions (in bold): there should be no restrictions at all, because imposing them would be unfair. This is the case because (premises underlined): any distraction can cause an accident, some people are capable of using their phone while driving, people who spend lot of time in the car for professional reasons still need to communicate with loved ones. A moderator then joins the discussion to (a) provide a clarification as to why the focus is on texting and a link to further information on the matter, and (b) ask User 2 to elaborate on the personal communication issue, and to propose alternatives. In the Appendix we report another example from the same topic and thread, where the user acts as a problematizer, challenging the scope and definition of the rule under discussion and the moderator acts as a ""discourse traffic director"", pointing out that the user should read and contribute to different threads in the discussion.

The guidelines for human moderators in Reg-ulationRoom have been defined in advance in a 'moderator protocol' (eRulemaking Initiative et al., 2017) which reflect the moderator actions mentioned in the examples. In the protocol the moderator roles were divided into two main classes. Supervision functions include general moderator actions that do not necessarily target the specific content of the posts, e.g., greeting participants, monitoring compliance with netiquette (policing), or helping with technical difficulties. Substantive moderator functions aim to improve the quality of comments and promote fruitful discourse. As the examples above clearly show, this can both mean that the moderator encourages exchanges between discourse participants and participation in other posts (broadening the scope of the discussion), or helping users to improve the content of their posts (requests for clarification, focusing on one topic, substantive reasoning, sharing personal experiences).

RegulationRoom represents an excellent example of the beneficial role of the moderator in maintaining productive argumentation from participants. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little to no NLP work targeting moderation modeling. Park et al.

sent2: We propose to make a first step in tackling this challenge by mapping it into a concrete application: (semi-)automatic moderation implemented as a form of discourse optimization, or, as it is commonly referred to in the Social Sciences, facilitation (Kaner et al., 2007;Trénel, 2009).
sent3: To illustrate the dynamics of moderation, let us start from concrete examples from a deliberation platform, RegulationRoom.
sent4: This discussion forum has been employed by public institutions to gather citizens contributions on discussions targeting very heterogeneous issues (more details can be found in Appendix).
sent5: Let us consider the following example from a discussion on the distracted driving by commercial vehicle operators (e.g., truckers and bus drivers).
sent6: The posts we selected (arrows indicate comment nesting) are from the discussion sub-thread: Texting -what are the risks?
sent7: 5 The example involves two users who clearly differ in their argumentation style and position.
sent8: User 1 has a clear position on the topic (claim in bold: not just texting, but all cellphone interactions should be banned), which she/he supports with personal reports (underlined text) an emotional tone, and a style which is typical of social media text.
sent9: User 2 replies, opening the post on a sarcastic note, which serves as the first premise to her/his (implicit) claim which is encoded in three rethorical questions (in bold): there should be no restrictions at all, because imposing them would be unfair.
sent10: This is the case because (premises underlined): any distraction can cause an accident, some people are capable of using their phone while driving, people who spend lot of time in the car for professional reasons still need to communicate with loved ones.
sent11: A moderator then joins the discussion to (a) provide a clarification as to why the focus is on texting and a link to further information on the matter, and (b) ask User 2 to elaborate on the personal communication issue, and to propose alternatives.
sent12: In the Appendix we report another example from the same topic and thread, where the user acts as a problematizer, challenging the scope and definition of the rule under discussion and the moderator acts as a ""discourse traffic director"", pointing out that the user should read and contribute to different threads in the discussion.
sent13: The guidelines for human moderators in Reg-ulationRoom have been defined in advance in a 'moderator protocol' (eRulemaking Initiative et al., 2017) which reflect the moderator actions mentioned in the examples.
sent14: In the protocol the moderator roles were divided into two main classes.
sent15: Supervision functions include general moderator actions that do not necessarily target the specific content of the posts, e.g., greeting participants, monitoring compliance with netiquette (policing), or helping with technical difficulties.
sent16: Substantive moderator functions aim to improve the quality of comments and promote fruitful discourse.
sent17: As the examples above clearly show, this can both mean that the moderator encourages exchanges between discourse participants and participation in other posts (broadening the scope of the discussion), or helping users to improve the content of their posts (requests for clarification, focusing on one topic, substantive reasoning, sharing personal experiences).RegulationRoom represents an excellent example of the beneficial role of the moderator in maintaining productive argumentation from participants.
sent18: However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little to no NLP work targeting moderation modeling.
sent19: Park et al. (2012) used data from Regula-tionRoom and conducted an annotation study to empirically categorize the types of moderator interventions specified in the moderator protocol.
sent20: Classification experiments were conducted using SVM to predict the type of action a moderator would perform, given the previous comment.
sent21: However this work is limited as it only focuses on two types of moderator interventions (broadening the scope of the discussion, improving argument quality) and as it does not predict whether the moderator should intervene, building on the assumption that a given comment has already been flagged as ""in need for moderation"".
sent22: Besides the concrete example of Regulation-Room, moderation and discourse facilitation have been, and still are, a crucial topic in digital democracy.
sent23: 6 The know-how of digital democracy experts is an invaluable starting point for the application of AM to moderation, as current research targets both the integration of digital solutions to facilitate online campaigns, and a critical reflection of the effects of such innovations on the deliberation outcomes.
sent24: Digital innovation supporting deliberation Argument maps (Walton, 2005) are widely employed to support online discussions, as an emerging optimization of the deliberation.
sent25: Given a specific topic, for example possible reactions to climate change, users who wish to contribute to the discussion are requested to structure their contribution by producing an item in a conceptual map and optionally writing an accompanying post.
sent26: Their contribution to the argument maps is often reviewed by a moderator.
sent27: So in a sense, the argument map for a given deliberation process is the outcome of a process that comes both from below (the user) and above (the moderator).
sent28: Thanks to argument maps, the overall discourse picture can be overviewed and it is easier for the group of contributors to express support for one (or many) of the available options, without having to read a large number of long posts.
sent29: An example of this approach is represented in Deliberatorium 7 , an e-deliberation platform which has been extensively employed in many reference studies on the effect of digital innovation on deliberation (Klein, 2011).
sent30: Another example of a digital deliberation platform which integrates argument maps and offers an option for moderation is COLAGREE (Yang et al., 2021;Ito, 2018).
sent31: Among the studies testing the impact of such digital platforms on online deliberation, Spada et al. (2015) tests the effect of Deliberatorium's argument maps on an online discussion among the supporters of the Italian Democratic party concerning the desired features of electoral law to be proposed by the party to the Parliament.
sent32: This study compared the discussion of users employing Deliberatorium and a control group using a traditional forum format which was then encoded into argument maps.
sent33: The comparison showed that the argument map modality did not discourage participation, and while it appeared to make users less creative (fewer new ideas as compared to the traditional forum), it also reduced the rate of claims without further discussion.
sent34: Yet, the need for trained moderators tends to be a significant bottleneck (both in terms of time and of costs) in digital deliberation.
sent35: Moreover, empirical research on the effect of moderation on deliberation has uncovered the risks of biased moderation.
sent36: For example, the experiment in Spada and Vreeland (2013) tests the extent to which moderators can influence participants' behavior by expressing their views during the moderation process.","1. What is the challenge in grounding AQ in a discourse perspective?

Distinguishing between personal opinion, fact, and fake news, for example, is not always straightforward, as seen in recent work on fake news detection (Kotonya and Toni, 2020). Further, the language used on such platforms is infamously chaotic and often non-standard in comparison to the language use in more structured environments, like parliamentary debates.

Recent work by Schaefer and Stede (2020), among others, have aimed to construct large Twitter corpora annotated for argument components, including argumentative spans within tweets. On the other hand, annotation guidelines are not necessarily clear, and the theoretical motivations underlying the proposed guidelines used to generate labelled corpora rarely include motivation for the use of a particular theoretical basis. Bauwelinck and Lefever (2020) introduce a pilot study and aim to provide a clear justification of the theories and definitions underlying the design of a set of guidelines.', 'The linguistic, structural, and logistic complexity and ""openness"" of such platforms clearly present unique challenges. However, being able to work well with argumentative text from social media and discussion forums is essential considering the continuously growing impact on the political and social framework of modern times.', 'Multilingual argument mining Multilinguality is an important area of research in NLP that has gained more attention recently because of the crosslingual transfer potentials of Pre-trained Language Models (Devlin et al., 2019;Conneau et al., 2020) and because of the potentials for a societal impact at a global scale. The latter is particularly important when considering AM for Social Good since language should not be a barrier for participation if the goal is to allow any productive contribution.', 'Various recent studies have investigated multilinguality for AM. Eger et al. (2019) discuss a series of experiments on using machine translation and annotation projection for AM, specifically argument components extraction and classification in German, English, and Chinese. A similar approach to build training data in other languages using machine translation is done in Toledo-Ronen et al. (2020), which use a pre-trained multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) for modeling. This approach is shown to perform well for classifying argument stance and detecting evidence, but not for predicting argument quality scores. Multilingual stance detection in political social media text (Vamvas and Sennrich, 2020) is also investigated in Lai et al. (2020) using stylistic, structural, affective and contextual features from text and analysing the scenarios in which each of these features is effective.', 'Other work has also dealt with building non-English datasets (Lindahl, 2020;Bauwelinck and Lefever, 2020;Schaefer and Stede, 2020;Zotova et al., 2020), but there still seems to be a focus on Indo-European languages (and sometimes Chinese) with a lack of datasets and analysis extending to other languages. This is a general issue in NLP research that extends to performance bias in favor of standard dialects for example in English (Blodgett et al., 2016) and bias that could target certain user groups instead of protecting them as was shown for Hate Speech Detection (Davidson et al., 2019). This is an important limitation to address in AM as well for more inclusivity and towards a more positive societal impact.']","In social media While overtly argumentative text, like those described above, represents the natural domain of application for AM, social media constitute a powerful source of large amounts of data (billions of words) despite facing particular challenges in AM.

Social media plays an increasingly significant role in modern political and social discourse, yet resources built for conducting AM on this type of data structure remain limited for clear reasons. These platforms inherently collect and spread a wide range of content, including personal opinions, facts, fake news, and additional information of interest to users. Distinguishing between personal opinion, fact, and fake news, for example, is not always straightforward, as seen in recent work on fake news detection (Kotonya and Toni, 2020).

Multilingual argument mining Multilinguality is an important area of research in NLP that has gained more attention recently because of the crosslingual transfer potentials of Pre-trained Language Models (Devlin et al., 2019;Conneau et al., 2020) and because of the potentials for a societal impact at a global scale. The latter is particularly important when considering AM for Social Good since language should not be a barrier for participation if the goal is to allow any productive contribution.

Various recent studies have investigated multilinguality for AM. Eger et al. (2019) discuss a series of experiments on using machine translation and annotation projection for AM, specifically argument components extraction and classification in German, English, and Chinese. A similar approach to build training data in other languages using machine translation is done in Toledo-Ronen et al. (2020), which use a pre-trained multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) for modeling. This approach is shown to perform well for classifying argument stance and detecting evidence, but not for predicting argument quality scores. Multilingual stance detection in political social media text (Vamvas and Sennrich, 2020) is also investigated in Lai et al. (2020) using stylistic, structural, affective and contextual features from text and analysing the scenarios in which each of these features is effective.

Other work has also dealt with building non-English datasets (Lindahl, 2020;Bauwelinck and Lefever, 2020;Schaefer and Stede, 2020;Zotova et al., 2020), but there still seems to be a focus on Indo-European languages (and sometimes Chinese) with a lack of datasets and analysis extending to other languages. This is a general issue in NLP research that extends to performance bias in favor of standard dialects for example in English (Blodgett et al., 2016) and bias that could target certain user groups instead of protecting them as was shown for Hate Speech Detection (Davidson et al., 2019). This is an important limitation to address in AM as well for more inclusivity and towards a more positive societal impact.","(p3.0) In social media While overtly argumentative text, like those described above, represents the natural domain of application for AM, social media constitute a powerful source of large amounts of data (billions of words) despite facing particular challenges in AM.

(p3.1) Social media plays an increasingly significant role in modern political and social discourse, yet resources built for conducting AM on this type of data structure remain limited for clear reasons. These platforms inherently collect and spread a wide range of content, including personal opinions, facts, fake news, and additional information of interest to users. Distinguishing between personal opinion, fact, and fake news, for example, is not always straightforward, as seen in recent work on fake news detection (Kotonya and Toni, 2020).

sent24: Multilingual stance detection in political social media text (Vamvas and Sennrich, 2020) is also investigated in Lai et al. (2020) using stylistic, structural, affective and contextual features from text and analysing the scenarios in which each of these features is effective.
sent25: Other work has also dealt with building non-English datasets (Lindahl, 2020;Bauwelinck and Lefever, 2020;Schaefer and Stede, 2020;Zotova et al., 2020), but there still seems to be a focus on Indo-European languages (and sometimes Chinese) with a lack of datasets and analysis extending to other languages.
sent26: This is a general issue in NLP research that extends to performance bias in favor of standard dialects for example in English (Blodgett et al., 2016) and bias that could target certain user groups instead of protecting them as was shown for Hate Speech Detection (Davidson et al., 2019).
sent27: This is an important limitation to address in AM as well for more inclusivity and towards a more positive societal impact.","# QUA Analysis:

C-S between dialects and/or standard vs. minority languages in computer mediated interaction was analyzed by Siebenhaar (2006) among Swiss-German dialects and by Robert-Tissot and Morel (2017) through SMS corpora collected across Germanic (i.e. English and German) and Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian) in Switzerland.

C-S is commonly observable across immigrant contexts in Europe. In the UK, Georgakopoulou and Finnis (2009) described the C-S patterns between English and Cypriot Greek while Issa (2006) focused on the C-S between English and Cypriot Turkish communities in London. Wei and Milroy (1995) analyzed the C-S between English and Chinese from a conversational analysis point of view based on the interactions of bilingual (Chinese-English) families in Northeastern England. In addition, Ożańska-Ponikwia (2016) investigated the Polish-English C-S in the UK as well. C-S among immigrant community members have also been widely studied in Germany (e.g. Turkish-German C-S by Keim (2008) and Ç etinoglu (2017), Russian-German C-S by Khakimov (2016)). In the Netherlands, C-S studies include Turkish-Dutch C-S by Backus (2010) and Dutch-Morroccan C-S by Nortier (1990). In Belgium, Meeuws and Blommaert (1998) studied the French-Lingala-Swahili C-S among immigrants of Zaire and Treffers-Daller (1994) studied French-Dutch C-S in Brussels. In Spain, Jieanu (2013) describes the Romanian-Spanish C-S among the Romanian immigrants. In addition to the C-S analyses within spoken interactions of immigrant communities across Europe, there are also studies about C-S within computer mediated communication as well. These studies include Greek-German C-S by Androutsopoulos (2015) in Germany, Turkish-Dutch C-S by Papalexakis et al. (2014), Papalexakis and Dogruöz (2015) and a comparison of Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch C-S by Dorleijn and Nortier (2009) in the Netherlands. Similarly, Marley (2011) compared French-Arabic C-S within computer mediated interaction across Moroccan communities in France and the UK.

In addition to daily communication, some linguists are also interested in the C-S observed in historical documents. While Swain (2002) explored Latin-Greek C-S by Cicero (Roman Statesman), Dunkel (2000) analyzed C-S in his communication with Atticus (Roman philosopher who studied in Athens) in the Roman Empire. Argenter (2001) reports cases of language mixing within the Catalan Jewish community (in Spain) in the 14th and 15th centuries and Rothman (2011) highlights the C-S between Italian, Slavic and Turkish in the historical documents about Ottoman-Venetian relations. In Switzerland, Volk and Clematide (2014) worked on detecting and annotating C-S patterns in diachronic and multilingual (English, French, German, Italian, Romansh and Swiss German) Alpine Heritage corpus.

Within the media context, Martin (1998) investigated English C-S in written French advertising, and Onysko (2007) investigated the English C-S in German written media through corpus analyses. Zhiganova (2016) indicates that German speakers perceive C-S into English for advertising purposes with both positive and negative consequences.

1. **Multilingual Communities**: In regions where multiple languages are spoken, such as Catalonia (Catalan and Spanish) or Brussels (French and Dutch), individuals often switch between languages depending on the social setting or the people they are communicating with.

2. **Workplaces**: In international companies or organizations, employees might switch between English and the local language to accommodate colleagues from different linguistic backgrounds.

3. **Educational Settings**: In schools and universities, especially those with international students, code-switching can occur between the local language and English or other languages of instruction.

4. **Family and Social Gatherings**: In families with mixed linguistic backgrounds, members might switch languages to include everyone in the conversation or to express certain cultural nuances.

5. **Media and Entertainment**: In media, such as television shows, movies, and music, code-switching can be used to reflect the multicultural reality of European societies or to reach a broader audience.

6. **Online Communication**: On social media platforms and in digital communication, people often switch languages to connect with a wider audience or to express themselves more effectively.

There are 121 major languages and 1599 other languages in India, out of which 22 (Assamese, Bangla, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Kannada, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Urdu) are scheduled languages with an official recognition (almost 97% of the population speaks one of the scheduled languages). Most of the population ( 93%) speak languages from the Indo-Aryan (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Urdu, Gujarati, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Rajasthani, Sindhi, Assamese, Maithili, Odia) and Dravidian (Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil) language families. The census excludes languages with a population lower than 10,000 speakers. Given this, it is probably difficult to find monolingual speakers in India considering the linguistic diversity and wide-spread multilingualism. Kachru (1978) provides one of the early studies on the types and functions of C-S in India with a historical understanding of the multilingual context.', 'In addition to the mutual influences and convergence of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages internally, he mentions Persian and English as outside influences on Indian languages. Similarly, Sridhar (1978) provides an excellent comparative overview about the functions of C-S in Kannada in relation to the Perso-Arabic vs. English influences. Kumar (1986) gives examples about the formal (e.g. within NPs, PPs, VPs) and functional (i.e. social and stylistic) aspects of Hindi-English C-S from a theoretical point of view. More recently, Doley (2013) explains how fish mongers in a local fish market in Assam adjust and switch between Assamese, English and local languages strategically to sell their products to multilingual clientele. Another observation about C-S in daily life comes from Boro (2020) who provides examples of English, Assamese and Bodo (another language spoken in the Assam region) C-S and borrowings. In addition to English, Portuguese was also in contact with the local languages as a result colonization in South India. For example, Kapp (1997) explains the Portuguese influence through borrowings in Dravidian languages (i.e. Kannada and Telugu) spoken in India.', 'Instead of automatic data collection and methods of analyses, the C-S examples for the abovementioned studies are (probably) encountered and collected by the authors themselves in daily life interactions over a period of time with limited means. Nowadays, these small sets of data would be regarded as insignificant in computational areas of research. However, ignoring these studies and data could have serious consequences since crucial information about the social and cultural dynamics in a multilingual setting would also be lost. For example, Nadkarni (1975) proves this point by explaining how social factors influence the C-S between Saraswat Brahmin dialect of Konkani (Indo-Aryan language) and Kannada (Dravidian language) in the South of India. Both languages have been in contact with each other for over four hundred years. Saraswat Brahmins are fluent in both Konkani and Kannada but they do not speak Konkani with Kannada speakers and they also do not C-S between Konkani and Kannada. Nadkarni (1975) attributes this preference to the high prestige associated with Konkani within the given social context. Since Kannada (perceived as less prestigious) is widely spoken in that region, Konkani speakers learn and speak Kannada for functional purposes in daily life which does not involve C-S. However, it is not common for Kannada speakers to learn and speak Konkani (Nadkarni, 1975).', 'C-S in India has been investigated through written media, advertising and film industry as well. Si (2011) analyzed Hindi-English C-S in the scripts of seven Bollywood movies which were filmed between 1982 and 2004. Her results indicate a change of direction C-S over the years. More specifically, Hindi was the dominant language with occasional switches to English for the early productions but English became the dominant language especially for younger generations in the later productions. A similar trend has been observed for Bengali movie scripts as well. Through analyzing movie scripts (between 1970s and 2010s), Chatterjee (2016) finds a drastic increase in the use of bilingual verbs (e.g. renovate koreche ""renovation do"") over time and attributes this rise to the increasing popularity of English in Indian society. Within the immigrant context, Gardner-Chloros and Charles (2007) focused on the types and functions of C-S between Hindi and English across the TV programs (e.g. highly scripted vs. loosely scripted programs) of a British/Asian cable channel in the UK. Although they have come across C-S in a variety of TV shows, the least amount of C-S was encountered in the news broadcasts (i.e. highly scripted). In general, they have encountered less C-S on TV broadcasts in comparison to the natural speech and attribute this factor to the consciousness of TV personalities about pure language use (instead of C-S). Similarly, Zipp (2017) analyzed Gujarati-English C-S within a radio show targeting British South Asians living in the US and concluded that C-S was part of identity construction among youngsters (group identity). Pratapa and Choudhury (2017) perform a quantitative study of 18 recent Bollywood (Hindi) movies and find that C-S is used for establishing identity, social dynamics between characters and the socio-cultural context of the movie.', 'From an advertising point of view, Kathpalia and Wee Ong (2015) analyzed C-S in Hinglish (i.e. Hindi, English, Urdu, Sanskrit according to their definition) billboards about the Amul brand in India. After compiling the advertisements on billboards (1191), they classified the structures and functions of C-S. Their results indicate more intrasentential C-S than intersentential ones on the billboards. In terms of function, the advertisers used C-S to indicate figures of speech (e.g. puns, associations, contradictory associations, word-creation and repetitions) to attract the attention of the target group. Mohanty (2006) provides an extended overview of the multilingual education system in India exploring the types and quality of schools across a wide spectrum. In general, high-cost English Medium (EM) education is valued by upper-class and affluent families. Although low-cost EM education is also available for lower income families, he questions its impact in comparison to education in the local languages. Sridhar (2002) explains that C-S is commonly practiced among students in schools across India. In addition, she finds it unrealistic to ask the students to separate the two languages harshly. In immigrant contexts, Martin et al. (2006) investigates how Gujarati-English C-S is used among the South Asian students in educational settings in the UK. Another analysis reveals a shift from Bengali toward English among the younger generations of the immigrant Bengali community in the UK (Al-Azami, 2006). In terms of the C-S patterns, first generation immigrants integrate English words while speaking Bengali whereas English dominates the conversations of younger generations with occasional switches to Bengali. There are also studies about Bengali-English C-S in the UK school settings (Pagett, 2006) and Bangladesh (Obaidullah, 2016) as well. However, a systematic comparison between Bengali-English C-S in India, Bangladesh and immigrant settings are lacking.', 'In their study about aphasic patients, Shyamala Chengappa and Bhat (2004) report increased frequency of C-S between Malayalam and English for aphasic patients in comparison to the control group. However, there were less differences between the groups in terms of functions of C-S. Deepa and Shyamala (2019) find that amount and types of C-S could be used to differentiate between healthy and mild dementia patients who are bilingual in Kannada and English. Although both studies are carried out with limited subjects, they offer insights about the use of C-S in health settings as well.']","According to the 2011 Census (Chandramouli, 2011), 26% of the population of India is bilingual, while 7% is trilingual.

C-S across Languages: Indian Context##
According to the 2011 Census (Chandramouli, 2011), 26% of the population of India is bilingual, while 7% is trilingual. There are 121 major languages and 1599 other languages in India, out of which 22 (Assamese, Bangla, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Kannada, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Urdu) are scheduled languages with an official recognition (almost 97% of the population speaks one of the scheduled languages). Most of the population ( 93%) speak languages from the Indo-Aryan (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Urdu, Gujarati, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Rajasthani, Sindhi, Assamese, Maithili, Odia) and Dravidian (Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil) language families. The census excludes languages with a population lower than 10,000 speakers. Given this, it is probably difficult to find monolingual speakers in India considering the linguistic diversity and wide-spread multilingualism. Kachru (1978) provides one of the early studies on the types and functions of C-S in India with a historical understanding of the multilingual context.

In addition to the mutual influences and convergence of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages internally, he mentions Persian and English as outside influences on Indian languages. Similarly, Sridhar (1978) provides an excellent comparative overview about the functions of C-S in Kannada in relation to the Perso-Arabic vs. English influences. Kumar (1986) gives examples about the formal (e.g. within NPs, PPs, VPs) and functional (i.e. social and stylistic) aspects of Hindi-English C-S from a theoretical point of view. More recently, Doley (2013) explains how fish mongers in a local fish market in Assam adjust and switch between Assamese, English and local languages strategically to sell their products to multilingual clientele. Another observation about C-S in daily life comes from Boro (2020) who provides examples of English, Assamese and Bodo (another language spoken in the Assam region) C-S and borrowings. In addition to English, Portuguese was also in contact with the local languages as a result colonization in South India. For example, Kapp (1997) explains the Portuguese influence through borrowings in Dravidian languages (i.e. Kannada and Telugu) spoken in India.

Instead of automatic data collection and methods of analyses, the C-S examples for the abovementioned studies are (probably) encountered and collected by the authors themselves in daily life interactions over a period of time with limited means. Nowadays, these small sets of data would be regarded as insignificant in computational areas of research. However, ignoring these studies and data could have serious consequences since crucial information about the social and cultural dynamics in a multilingual setting would also be lost. For example, Nadkarni (1975) proves this point by explaining how social factors influence the C-S between Saraswat Brahmin dialect of Konkani (Indo-Aryan language) and Kannada (Dravidian language) in the South of India. Both languages have been in contact with each other for over four hundred years. Saraswat Brahmins are fluent in both Konkani and Kannada but they do not speak Konkani with Kannada speakers and they also do not C-S between Konkani and Kannada. Nadkarni (1975) attributes this preference to the high prestige associated with Konkani within the given social context. Since Kannada (perceived as less prestigious) is widely spoken in that region, Konkani speakers learn and speak Kannada for functional purposes in daily life which does not involve C-S. However, it is not common for Kannada speakers to learn and speak Konkani (Nadkarni, 1975).

C-S in India has been investigated through written media, advertising and film industry as well. Si (2011) analyzed Hindi-English C-S in the scripts of seven Bollywood movies which were filmed between 1982 and 2004. Her results indicate a change of direction C-S over the years. More specifically, Hindi was the dominant language with occasional switches to English for the early productions but English became the dominant language especially for younger generations in the later productions. A similar trend has been observed for Bengali movie scripts as well. Through analyzing movie scripts (between 1970s and 2010s), Chatterjee (2016) finds a drastic increase in the use of bilingual verbs (e.g. renovate koreche ""renovation do"") over time and attributes this rise to the increasing popularity of English in Indian society. Within the immigrant context, Gardner-Chloros and Charles (2007) focused on the types and functions of C-S between Hindi and English across the TV programs (e.g. highly scripted vs. loosely scripted programs) of a British/Asian cable channel in the UK. Although they have come across C-S in a variety of TV shows, the least amount of C-S was encountered in the news broadcasts (i.e. highly scripted). In general, they have encountered less C-S on TV broadcasts in comparison to the natural speech and attribute this factor to the consciousness of TV personalities about pure language use (instead of C-S). Similarly, Zipp (2017) analyzed Gujarati-English C-S within a radio show targeting British South Asians living in the US and concluded that C-S was part of identity construction among youngsters (group identity). Pratapa and Choudhury (2017) perform a quantitative study of 18 recent Bollywood (Hindi) movies and find that C-S is used for establishing identity, social dynamics between characters and the socio-cultural context of the movie.

From an advertising point of view, Kathpalia and Wee Ong (2015) analyzed C-S in Hinglish (i.e. Hindi, English, Urdu, Sanskrit according to their definition) billboards about the Amul brand in India. After compiling the advertisements on billboards (1191), they classified the structures and functions of C-S. Their results indicate more intrasentential C-S than intersentential ones on the billboards. In terms of function, the advertisers used C-S to indicate figures of speech (e.g. puns, associations, contradictory associations, word-creation and repetitions) to attract the attention of the target group. Mohanty (2006) provides an extended overview of the multilingual education system in India exploring the types and quality of schools across a wide spectrum.

1. **Multilingual Environment**: India is a highly multilingual country with numerous languages and dialects spoken across different regions. This naturally leads to code-switching as individuals navigate between languages in various social and professional contexts.

2. **Education System**: The education system in India often promotes bilingualism or trilingualism, with English commonly taught alongside regional languages. This educational background encourages code-switching among students and professionals.

3. **Media and Popular Culture**: Indian media, including films, television, and social media, frequently blend languages, particularly Hindi and English (often referred to as ""Hinglish""). This exposure influences everyday language use and encourages code-switching.

4. **Social Identity and Group Membership**: Code-switching can be a way to signal social identity, group membership, or solidarity. For instance, switching between languages can help individuals fit in with different social groups or convey a certain social status.

5. **Professional and Economic Factors**: In many professional settings, particularly in urban areas and multinational companies, English is often the preferred language for communication. However, regional languages are still used for informal interactions, leading to frequent code-switching.

6. **Cultural Practices and Traditions**: Cultural events, rituals, and traditional practices often involve the use of multiple languages, contributing to the habit of code-switching in daily life.

In sum, language technologies for code-switching seem to be constrained by the lack of availability of diverse code-switching training data, evaluation benchmarks, and the absence of user-facing applications.","Current computational approaches to code-switching in user-facing applications face several limitations:

1. **Data Scarcity**: There is a lack of large, high-quality datasets that include code-switched language, making it difficult to train robust models.

2. **Language Pair Diversity**: Code-switching can occur between any two languages, and the linguistic properties of these pairs can vary widely. Most existing models are not versatile enough to handle the vast diversity of language pairs.

3. **Context Understanding**: Code-switching often depends on the context, including cultural and situational factors, which current models struggle to understand and incorporate effectively.

4. **Grammar and Syntax**: Code-switching can involve complex grammatical and syntactical rules that are not well-represented in monolingual or even bilingual models.

5. **Real-time Processing**: User-facing applications require real-time processing, and current models may not be efficient enough to handle code-switching dynamically without significant latency.

6. **Evaluation Metrics**: There is a lack of standardized metrics for evaluating the performance of code-switching models, making it difficult to benchmark and compare different approaches.

7. **User Personalization**: Code-switching can be highly personal and vary from user to user. Current models often lack the ability to adapt to individual user preferences and styles.

8. **Integration with Existing Systems**: Incorporating code-switching capabilities into existing applications and systems can be challenging due to compatibility and integration issues.

Addressing these limitations requires advancements in data collection, model training, contextual understanding, and real-time processing capabilities.","What are the major limitations of current computational approaches to code-switching in user-facing applications, particularly in terms of linguistic and social factors, training data, and evaluation benchmarks?","What are the major limitations of current computational approaches to code-switching in user-facing applications, particularly regarding linguistic and social factors?","A major limitation of current computational approaches to code-switching in user-facing applications is the lack of end-to-end systems that interact directly with users in multilingual communities.

Then, methods can be built accordingly to counter the features such as label-associated keywords (He et al., 2019), label-associated text fragments (Mahabadi et al., 2020), and general easy-to-learn patterns of data (Nam et al., 2020). Similarly, Clark et al. (2019Utama et al. (2020a,b) propose to ensemble with a model explicitly capturing bias, where the main model is trained together with this ""bias-only"" model such that the main model is discouraged from using biases. More recent work (Xiong et al., 2021) shows the ensemble-based approaches can be further improved via better calibrating the bias-only model. Furthermore, additional regularizers have been introduced for robust fine-tuning over pre-trained models, e.g., mutual-information-based regularizers (Wang et al., 2021a) and smoothness-inducing adversarial regularization (Jiang et al., 2020).

In a broader scope, given that one of the main challenges of domain adaptation is to counter the model's tendency in learning domain-specific spurious features (Ganin et al., 2016), some methods contributing to domain adaption may have also progressed along the line of our interest, e.g., domain adversarial neural network (Ganin et al., 2016). This line of work also inspires a family of methods forcing the model to learn auxiliary-annotationinvariant representations with a side component (Ghifary et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2017;Rozantsev et al., 2018;Motiian et al., 2017;Li et al., 2018;Vernikos et al., 2020).

Despite the diverse concrete ideas introduced, the above is mainly training for small empirical loss across different domains or distributions in addition to forcing the model to be invariant to domain-specific spurious features. As an extension along this direction, invariant risk minimization (IRM) (Arjovsky et al., 2019) introduces the idea of invariant predictors across multiple environments, which was later followed and discussed by a variety of extensions (Choe et al., 2020;Ahmed et al., 2020;Rosenfeld et al., 2021).

In the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), inductive bias can be used to improve the robustness of models in several ways:

1. **Incorporating Linguistic Knowledge**: By embedding linguistic rules and structures (such as syntax, grammar, and semantics) into the model, it can better handle variations in language and understand context more effectively. This helps the model to generalize better to new, unseen data.

2. **Pre-trained Language Models**: Using pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, or RoBERTa, which have been trained on large corpora, can provide a strong inductive bias. These models capture a wide range of language patterns and nuances, making them more robust to different types of text inputs.

3. **Domain-Specific Training**: Fine-tuning models on domain-specific data can introduce an inductive bias that makes the model more adept at handling the particularities of that domain. This can improve performance and robustness in specialized applications.

4. **Data Augmentation**: Introducing variations in the training data, such as paraphrasing, synonym replacement, or noise injection, can help the model learn to be more robust to different forms of input. This creates an inductive bias towards understanding the underlying meaning rather than surface forms.

5. **Regularization Techniques**: Techniques like dropout, weight decay, and adversarial training can introduce an inductive bias that discourages the model from overfitting to the training data. This helps in making the model more robust to variations in the input data.

6. **Architectural Choices**: Using model architectures that are inherently more robust, such as transformers with attention mechanisms, can provide an inductive bias that helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input, improving its ability to handle diverse and noisy data.

By carefully designing and incorporating these inductive biases, NLP models can become more robust, leading to better performance on a wide range of tasks and inputs.",How can side components and regularization techniques be used to improve robustness in NLP models?,How can side components and regularization techniques be used to improve robustness in NLP models?,"To improve robustness in NLP models, one typically constructs a side component to inform the main model about misaligned features and then regularizes the main model based on this side component.

What factors contribute to the robustness of NLP models according to recent studies?

Answer:

Pretraining has been demonstrated as an effective way to improve NLP models' out-of-distribution robustness (Hendrycks et al., 2020a; Tu et al., 2020), potentially due to its self-supervised objective and the use of large amounts of diverse pre-training data that encourages generalization from a small number of examples that counter the spurious correlations.

In many cases, both the data and the model can contribute to a model's lack of robustness, suggesting that data-driven and model-based approaches could be combined to further improve a model's robustness.","Recent studies have identified several factors that contribute to the robustness of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. These factors include:

1. **Data Quality and Diversity**: High-quality, diverse training data helps models generalize better to various inputs and reduces the likelihood of overfitting to specific patterns.

2. **Model Architecture**: Advanced architectures, such as transformers, have shown improved robustness due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information.

3. **Regularization Techniques**: Methods like dropout, weight decay, and data augmentation help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to handle noisy or unseen data.

4. **Adversarial Training**: Training models with adversarial examples can make them more resilient to input perturbations and malicious attacks.

5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining predictions from multiple models can enhance robustness by mitigating the weaknesses of individual models.

6. **Fine-tuning and Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific tasks can improve performance and robustness, leveraging the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training.

7. **Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks**: Using comprehensive evaluation metrics and diverse benchmarks ensures that models are tested against a wide range of scenarios, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

8. **Error Analysis and Iterative Improvement**: Systematic error analysis and iterative refinement of models based on identified weaknesses can lead to more robust performance.

By focusing on these factors, researchers and practitioners can develop NLP models that are more robust and reliable in real-world applications.",What factors have recent studies identified as contributing to the out-of-distribution robustness of NLP models?,What factors have recent studies identified as contributing to the out-of-distribution robustness of NLP models?,"Pretraining has been demonstrated as an effective way to improve NLP models' out-of-distribution robustness (Hendrycks et al., 2020a; Tu et al., 2020), potentially due to its self-supervised objective and the use of large amounts of diverse pre-training data that encourage generalization from a small number of examples that counter spurious correlations.

Answer:

Pretraining has been demonstrated as an effective way to improve NLP models' out-of-distribution robustness (Hendrycks et al., 2020a; Tu et al., 2020), potentially due to its self-supervised objective and the use of large amounts of diverse pre-training data that encourage generalization from a small number of examples that counter spurious correlations.

sent2: Tu et al. (2020) showed a few other factors can also contribute to robust accuracy, including larger model size, more fine-tuning data, and longer fine-tuning.
sent3: A similar observation is made by Taori et al. (2020) in the vision domain, where the authors found training with larger and more diverse datasets offer better robustness consistently in multiple cases, compared to various robustness interventions proposed in the existing literature.
sent4: In general, the training strategy with an emphasis on a subset of samples that are particularly hard for the model to learn is sometimes also referred to as group DRO (Sagawa et al., 2020a), as an extension of vanilla distributional robust optimization (DRO) (Ben-Tal et al., 2013;Duchi et al., 2021).
sent5: Extensions of DRO are mostly discussing the strategies on how to identify the samples considered as minority: Nam et al. (2020) trained two models in parallel, where the ""debiased"" model focuses on examples not learned by the ""biased"" model; Lahoti et al. (2020) used an adversary model to identify samples that are challenging to the main model; Liu et al. (2021) proposed to train the model a second time via up-weighting examples that have high training losses during the first time.
sent6: When to Use Data-driven or Model-based Approaches?
sent7: In many cases both the data and the model can contribute to a model's lack of robustness, hence data-driven and model-based approaches could be combined to further improve a model's robustness.
sent8: One interesting phenomenon observed by (Liu et al., 2019) is to attribute models' robustness failures to blind spots in the training data, or the intrinsic learning ability of the model.
sent9: The authors found that both patterns are possible: in some cases models can be inoculated via being exposed to a small amount of challenging data, similar to the data augmentation approaches mentioned in Section 5.1; on the other hand, some challenging patterns remain difficult which connects to the larger question around generalizability to unseen adversarial and counterfactual patterns (Huang et al., 2020;Jha et al., 2020;Joshi and He, 2021), which is relatively under-explored but deserves much attention.","# QUA Analysis:

In the era of Transformers, there have been works attempting to reduce computation by either skip tokens at higher layers or forward tokens to higher layers. The PoWER-BERT model (Goyal et al., 2020) reduces the number of tokens processed by each Transformer layer based on their attention scores. The number of tokens to be dropped, referred to as the ""schedule,"" is optimized by combining the sparsity of a soft mask layer with the original loss function. This results in an improved balance between accuracy and processing time. TR-BERT (Ye et al., 2021) uses a dynamic approach to determine which tokens to skip, using reinforcement learning to train the model with a reward system that prioritizes classifier confidence while also penalizing the number of tokens retained. In contrast to PoWER-BERT, TR-BERT passes the skipped tokens to the final layer rather than discarding them. The Length-Adaptive Transformer (LAT, Kim and Cho, 2021) utilizes LengthDrop to randomly skip tokens during pretraining, aiming to close the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning.

If the model decides to skim, the small RNN will update only a fraction of the hid-den states. Otherwise, a regular full update will be conducted by the big RNN.

Here are some methods to achieve this:

1. **Pruning**: This involves removing less important weights or neurons from the network. Techniques like magnitude-based pruning, where weights with small magnitudes are removed, can help reduce the model size and computation.

2. **Quantization**: This technique reduces the precision of the weights and activations, typically from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers. This can significantly reduce the computational load and memory usage.

3. **Knowledge Distillation**: This method involves training a smaller, more efficient model (student) to mimic the behavior of a larger, more complex model (teacher). The student model can achieve similar performance with reduced computational requirements.

4. **Dynamic Computation**: Implementing mechanisms that allow the network to adaptively allocate computational resources based on the input. For example, using techniques like early exiting, where the model can make predictions at intermediate layers for simpler inputs, can save computation.

5. **Sparse Representations**: Encouraging sparsity in the network's activations or weights can lead to fewer computations. Sparse matrices can be processed more efficiently than dense ones.

6. **Efficient Architectures**: Designing neural network architectures that are inherently more efficient, such as Transformer variants like the Longformer or Linformer, which reduce the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism.

7. **Parameter Sharing**: Sharing parameters across different parts of the model can reduce the number of unique parameters that need to be computed and stored.

8. **Low-Rank Factorization**: Decomposing weight matrices into products of lower-rank matrices can reduce the number of parameters and the amount of computation required.

9. **Adaptive Inference**: Using techniques like conditional computation, where only a subset of the model is activated based on the input, can help in reducing unnecessary computations.

10. **Hardware Acceleration**: Leveraging specialized hardware like GPUs, TPUs, or FPGAs that are optimized for neural network computations can also help in reducing the effective computation time.

By employing these methods, it is possible to make dynamic neural networks for NLP more efficient, enabling faster inference and reduced resource consumption.","What are some specific techniques for reducing computation in dynamic neural networks for NLP, particularly in the context of RNNs and Transformers?","What are some specific methods for reducing computation in dynamic neural networks for NLP, particularly in RNN and Transformer models?","Some methods for reducing computation in dynamic neural networks for NLP include:

What are the three categories of skimming techniques in dynamic neural networks?

Answer:

None","The three categories of skimming techniques in dynamic neural networks are:

1. **Early Exiting**: This technique allows the network to make a decision and exit early if it determines that it has enough information to make a confident prediction, thereby saving computational resources.

2. **Dynamic Depth**: This involves adjusting the depth of the network dynamically based on the complexity of the input. For simpler inputs, fewer layers are used, while more complex inputs may require deeper processing.

3. **Dynamic Width**: This technique adjusts the width of the network, meaning the number of neurons or channels in each layer, based on the input's requirements. This allows the network to allocate more resources to more complex inputs and fewer resources to simpler ones.",What are the three main techniques used in dynamic neural networks to optimize computational efficiency based on input complexity?,What are the three main categories of skimming techniques used in dynamic neural networks?,,"Questions:

That is to say, if the confidence of an internal classifier does not satisfy the exit criterion, it will be disregarded. Ensemble-based early exit recycles these predictions and considers output from multiple internal classifiers to make better predictions. Based on the similarity between overfitting and overthinking, PABEE (Zhou et al., 2020a) borrows early stopping from model training. They first jointly train the internal classifiers with BERT by a weighted sum of cross-entropy losses that assigns larger weights for upper classifiers. For inference, the model exits when k consecutive internal classifiers make the same prediction. Other than improvement on performance and efficiency, they find that PABEE can improve adversarial robustness, which they attribute to the ensemble effect.  further introduce a diversity loss that encourages internal classifiers to have a diverse predicted probability distribution. They propose a voting mechanism to ensemble the internal classifiers by exiting early when a class has accumulated more votes than the threshold. Interestingly, LeeBERT (Zhu, 2021) adopts the opposite strategy: they promote consistency across internal classifiers by distilling them to each other. However, they introduce a learnable weight for the cross-entropy loss of each classifier and the distillation loss between each pair. They optimize these weights by a cross-level optimization algorithm.', 'They adopt PABEE\'s patience-based strategy for exiting. Liao et al. (2021) train linear transformation layers called ""imitation learners"", to approximate the hidden states of future layers based on current hidden states. For inference, the prediction after each layer is calculated by mixing the past predictions and the future predictions of the imitation learners. Entropy is used as the exit criterion. PCEE-BERT (Zhang et al., 2022a) borrows from both ensemble-based exit and confidencebased methods. The inference is terminated when multiple layers are confident.', 'Learning-based Early Exit Another stream of research is to learn a criterion for early exiting.', 'BERxiT (Xin et al., 2021) alternates between joint fine-tuning and two-stage fine-tuning by freezing parameters of Transformer and the final classifier for even-numbered iterations and unfreezing them for odd-numbered iterations. They also train a linear layer called a learning-to-exit (LTE) module to predict whether the current internal classifier makes the correct prediction. It takes the hidden states as input and outputs a confidence score, which is used to decide whether to exit. CAT (Schuster et al., 2021) introduces a ""meta consistency classifier"" to predict whether the output of an internal classifier conforms to the final classifier and exits when the consistency classifier predicts a certain level of conformity.', 'Cascading Cascading can be seen as a special form of early exit, performed at the model level. Li et al. (2021a) find that shallow features and internal classifiers in the first few layers of BERT utilized by early exit methods like DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) are not sufficient and reliable, underperforming a fine-tuned BERT with the same number of layers. Therefore, they propose to use a suite of complete models with different numbers of layers for cascading. CascadeBERT executes models one by one, from the smallest to the largest. It stops when a model outputs a confidence score (calibrated maximum class probability) that reaches the threshold.', 'Applications Although early exit is originally developed for classification, there have been works extending it to more tasks and settings. Li et al. (2021b) propose Token-Level Early-Exit that targets early exiting for sequence labeling. They use the maximum class probability as confidence on a per-token basis. Once the confidence hits the threshold, the hidden states of the corresponding tokens will be frozen and directly copied to upper layers. These exited tokens will not attend to other tokens at upper layers but can still be attended by other tokens. The model completely exits when every token exits. A similar idea is also presented in Elbayad et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2021b) where hidden states of some positions can be frozen and directly copied to upper layers, although the former is focused on generation and the latter is for classification. Xin et al. (2020a) apply DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) to document ranking and set different thresholds to the negative and positive classes for early exiting, to accommodate the imbalanced class distribution in document ranking. ELUE (Liu et al., 2021a) is a benchmark which evaluates the Pareto Front of early exit models on the FLOPs-performance plane. They provide a BERT-like baseline with jointly pretrained internal classifiers, to mitigate the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning.']","DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) two-stage; sum of CE loss entropy < θ RightTool (Schwartz et al., 2020) joint; sum of CE loss calibrated max class probability > θ FastBERT  two-stage; self-distillation entropy < θ RomeBERT (Geng et al., 2021) joint; self-distillation + GR entropy < θ SkipBERT (2022) joint; weighted sum of CE + KD max class probability > θ PABEE (Zhou et al., 2020a) joint; weighted sum of CE loss patience (#consistent prediction > θ ) Voting  joint; sum of CE + diversity loss accumulated votes > θ LeeBERT (Zhu, 2021) joint; auto-weighted sum of CE + KD loss patience (#consistent prediction > θ ) Past-Future (Liao et al., 2021) joint; weighted sum of CE + imitation learning entropy < θ PCEE-BERT (2022a) joint; weighted sum of CE patience (#consistent IC confidence > θ)

Other than improvement on performance and efficiency, they find that PABEE can improve adversarial robustness, which they attribute to the ensemble effect.  further introduce a diversity loss that encourages internal classifiers to have a diverse predicted probability distribution. They propose a voting mechanism to ensemble the internal classifiers by exiting early when a class has accumulated more votes than the threshold. Interestingly, LeeBERT (Zhu, 2021) adopts the opposite strategy: they promote consistency across internal classifiers by distilling them to each other. However, they introduce a learnable weight for the cross-entropy loss of each classifier and the distillation loss between each pair. They optimize these weights by a cross-level optimization algorithm.

They adopt PABEE's patience-based strategy for exiting. Liao et al. (2021) train linear transformation layers called ""imitation learners"", to approximate the hidden states of future layers based on current hidden states. For inference, the prediction after each layer is calculated by mixing the past predictions and the future predictions of the imitation learners. Entropy is used as the exit criterion. PCEE-BERT (Zhang et al., 2022a) borrows from both ensemble-based exit and confidencebased methods. The inference is terminated when multiple layers are confident.

Learning-based Early Exit Another stream of research is to learn a criterion for early exiting.

BERxiT (Xin et al., 2021) alternates between joint fine-tuning and two-stage fine-tuning by freezing parameters of Transformer and the final classifier for even-numbered iterations and unfreezing them for odd-numbered iterations. They also train a linear layer called a learning-to-exit (LTE) module to predict whether the current internal classifier makes the correct prediction. It takes the hidden states as input and outputs a confidence score, which is used to decide whether to exit. CAT (Schuster et al., 2021) introduces a ""meta consistency classifier"" to predict whether the output of an internal classifier conforms to the final classifier and exits when the consistency classifier predicts a certain level of conformity.

Cascading Cascading can be seen as a special form of early exit, performed at the model level. Li et al. (2021a) find that shallow features and internal classifiers in the first few layers of BERT utilized by early exit methods like DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) are not sufficient and reliable, underperforming a fine-tuned BERT with the same number of layers. Therefore, they propose to use a suite of complete models with different numbers of layers for cascading. CascadeBERT executes models one by one, from the smallest to the largest. It stops when a model outputs a confidence score (calibrated maximum class probability) that reaches the threshold.

Applications Although early exit is originally developed for classification, there have been works extending it to more tasks and settings. Li et al. (2021b) propose Token-Level Early-Exit that targets early exiting for sequence labeling. They use the maximum class probability as confidence on a per-token basis. Once the confidence hits the threshold, the hidden states of the corresponding tokens will be frozen and directly copied to upper layers. These exited tokens will not attend to other tokens at upper layers but can still be attended by other tokens. The model completely exits when every token exits. A similar idea is also presented in Elbayad et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2021b) where hidden states of some positions can be frozen and directly copied to upper layers, although the former is focused on generation and the latter is for classification. Xin et al. (2020a) apply DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) to document ranking and set different thresholds to the negative and positive classes for early exiting, to accommodate the imbalanced class distribution in document ranking. ELUE (Liu et al., 2021a) is a benchmark which evaluates the Pareto Front of early exit models on the FLOPs-performance plane. They provide a BERT-like baseline with jointly pretrained internal classifiers, to mitigate the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning.","(p9.0) DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) two-stage; sum of CE loss entropy < θ RightTool (Schwartz et al., 2020) joint; sum of CE loss calibrated max class probability > θ FastBERT  two-stage; self-distillation entropy < θ RomeBERT (Geng et al., 2021) joint; self-distillation + GR entropy < θ SkipBERT (2022) joint; weighted sum of CE + KD max class probability > θ PABEE (Zhou et al., 2020a) joint; weighted sum of CE loss patience (#consistent prediction > θ ) Voting  joint; sum of CE + diversity loss accumulated votes > θ LeeBERT (Zhu, 2021) joint; auto-weighted sum of CE + KD loss patience (#consistent prediction > θ ) Past-Future (Liao et al., 2021) joint; weighted sum of CE + imitation learning entropy < θ PCEE-BERT (2022a) joint; weighted sum of CE patience (#consistent IC confidence > θ)

This can lead to significant improvements in computational efficiency and speed, especially for tasks where not all inputs require the full capacity of the network. Here are some common methods for implementing early exit strategies:

1. **Intermediate Classifiers**: Insert classifiers at various depths within the network. During inference, if an intermediate classifier is confident enough about its prediction (based on a confidence threshold), the network can terminate early and use that prediction.

2. **Adaptive Computation Time (ACT)**: This method, proposed by Alex Graves, involves dynamically deciding the number of computational steps for each input. The network learns to predict a halting score at each step, and computation stops when the cumulative halting score exceeds a certain threshold.

3. **BranchyNet**: This approach involves adding multiple exit points (branches) at different layers of the network. Each branch has its own classifier, and the network can exit at any branch if the confidence level is high enough.

4. **Dynamic Neural Networks**: These networks adjust their structure or depth dynamically based on the input. Techniques like SkipNet allow the network to learn which layers to skip for different inputs, effectively creating a dynamic path through the network.

5. **Early Stopping in Training**: While not exactly an early exit during inference, early stopping during training can help in creating models that generalize better and might indirectly support early exit strategies by preventing overfitting.

6. **Reinforcement Learning-Based Methods**: Use reinforcement learning to train a policy that decides when to exit based on the state of the network and the input features.

7. **Conditional Computation**: This involves making parts of the network conditional on the input. For example, certain layers or blocks are only activated if needed, based on the input characteristics.

Implementing these strategies requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between computational savings and potential impacts on model accuracy. The choice of method can depend on the specific application and the performance requirements.",What are some specific techniques for implementing early exit strategies in BERT-based neural networks?,What are some methods for implementing early exit strategies in BERT-based neural networks?,"Sure, here is a refined answer based entirely on the context provided in the extracted section:

1. **CascadeBERT (Li et al., 2021a)**: This method uses confidence-based early exit strategies. It places lower BERT layers with confidence calibration and higher layers exit based on the calibrated max class probability exceeding a threshold.

2. **Ensemble-based Early Exit**: This strategy recycles predictions from multiple internal classifiers to make better predictions. For example, PABEE (Zhou et al., 2020a) uses a weighted sum of cross-entropy losses for training and exits when k consecutive internal classifiers make the same prediction. A voting mechanism is also used to exit early when a class accumulates more votes than a threshold.

3. **Learning-based Early Exit**: BERxiT (Xin et al., 2021) alternates between joint fine-tuning and two-stage fine-tuning, using a learning-to-exit (LTE) module to predict the correctness of the current internal classifier's prediction based on hidden states. CAT (Schuster et al., 2021) uses a ""meta consistency classifier"" to predict conformity to the final classifier and exits based on this conformity level.

4. **Cascading**: This approach uses a suite of complete models with different numbers of layers. CascadeBERT executes models sequentially from the smallest to the largest, stopping when a model's confidence score reaches the threshold.

5. **Token-Level Early Exit**: Proposed by Li et al. (2021b), this method targets sequence labeling by using the maximum class probability as confidence on a per-token basis. Tokens exit when their confidence hits the threshold, and the model completely exits when every token exits.

6. **Entropy-Based Exit**: Some methods use entropy as the exit criterion, where the model exits when the entropy of the prediction is below a certain threshold.

These strategies aim to improve performance and efficiency by allowing the model to exit early when certain criteria are met, thereby saving computational resources.","Questions:

What are some methods for implementing early exit strategies in BERT-based neural networks?

Answer:

Sure, here is a refined answer based entirely on the context provided in the extracted section:

**Refined Answer:**

1. **CascadeBERT (Li et al., 2021a)**: This method uses confidence-based early exit strategies. It places lower BERT layers with confidence calibration and higher layers exit based on the calibrated max class probability exceeding a threshold.

6. **Entropy-Based Exit**: Some methods use entropy as the exit criterion, where the model exits when the entropy of the prediction is below a certain threshold.

These strategies aim to improve performance and efficiency by allowing the model to exit early when certain criteria are met, thereby saving computational resources.","CascadeBERT (Li et al., 2021a) uses confidence-based early exit strategies, where lower BERT layers are placed with confidence calibration and higher layers exit based on calibrated max class probability exceeding a threshold.

Ensemble-based early exit strategies recycle these predictions and consider output from multiple internal classifiers to make better predictions.

PABEE (Zhou et al., 2020a) borrows early stopping from model training based on the similarity between overfitting and overthinking.

PABEE (Zhou et al., 2020a) first jointly trains the internal classifiers with BERT by using a weighted sum of cross-entropy losses that assigns larger weights to upper classifiers.

For inference, the model exits when k consecutive internal classifiers make the same prediction.

A voting mechanism is proposed to ensemble the internal classifiers by exiting early when a class has accumulated more votes than the threshold.

They adopt PABEE's patience-based strategy for exiting.

Entropy is used as the exit criterion.

The inference is terminated when multiple layers are confident.

It takes the hidden states as input and outputs a confidence score, which is used to decide whether to exit.

It stops when a model outputs a confidence score (calibrated maximum class probability) that reaches the threshold.","sent1: DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) two-stage; sum of CE loss entropy < θ RightTool (Schwartz et al., 2020) joint; sum of CE loss calibrated max class probability > θ FastBERT  two-stage; self-distillation entropy <

sent6: Ensemble-based Early Exit One drawback in confidence-based early exit is wasted computation.
sent7: That is to say, if the confidence of an internal classifier does not satisfy the exit criterion, it will be disregarded.
sent8: Ensemble-based early exit recycles these predictions and considers output from multiple internal classifiers to make better predictions.
sent9: Based on the similarity between overfitting and overthinking, PABEE (Zhou et al., 2020a) borrows early stopping from model training.
sent10: They first jointly train the internal classifiers with BERT by a weighted sum of cross-entropy losses that assigns larger weights for upper classifiers.
sent11: For inference, the model exits when k consecutive internal classifiers make the same prediction.
sent12: Other than improvement on performance and efficiency, they find that PABEE can improve adversarial robustness, which they attribute to the ensemble effect.
sent13: further introduce a diversity loss that encourages internal classifiers to have a diverse predicted probability distribution.
sent14: They propose a voting mechanism to ensemble the internal classifiers by exiting early when a class has accumulated more votes than the threshold.
sent15: Interestingly, LeeBERT (Zhu, 2021) adopts the opposite strategy: they promote consistency across internal classifiers by distilling them to each other.
sent16: However, they introduce a learnable weight for the cross-entropy loss of each classifier and the distillation loss between each pair.
sent17: They optimize these weights by a cross-level optimization algorithm.
sent18: They adopt PABEE's patience-based strategy for exiting.
sent19: Liao et al. (2021) train linear transformation layers called ""imitation learners"", to approximate the hidden states of future layers based on current hidden states.
sent20: For inference, the prediction after each layer is calculated by mixing the past predictions and the future predictions of the imitation learners.
sent21: Entropy is used as the exit criterion.
sent22: PCEE-BERT (Zhang et al., 2022a) borrows from both ensemble-based exit and confidencebased methods.
sent23: The inference is terminated when multiple layers are confident.
sent24: Learning-based Early Exit Another stream of research is to learn a criterion for early exiting.
sent25: BERxiT (Xin et al., 2021) alternates between joint fine-tuning and two-stage fine-tuning by freezing parameters of Transformer and the final classifier for even-numbered iterations and unfreezing them for odd-numbered iterations.
sent26: They also train a linear layer called a learning-to-exit (LTE) module to predict whether the current internal classifier makes the correct prediction.
sent27: It takes the hidden states as input and outputs a confidence score, which is used to decide whether to exit.
sent28: CAT (Schuster et al., 2021) introduces a ""meta consistency classifier"" to predict whether the output of an internal classifier conforms to the final classifier and exits when the consistency classifier predicts a certain level of conformity.
sent29: Cascading Cascading can be seen as a special form of early exit, performed at the model level.
sent30: Li et al. (2021a) find that shallow features and internal classifiers in the first few layers of BERT utilized by early exit methods like DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) are not sufficient and reliable, underperforming a fine-tuned BERT with the same number of layers.
sent31: Therefore, they propose to use a suite of complete models with different numbers of layers for cascading.
sent32: CascadeBERT executes models one by one, from the smallest to the largest.
sent33: It stops when a model outputs a confidence score (calibrated maximum class probability) that reaches the threshold.
sent34: Applications Although early exit is originally developed for classification, there have been works extending it to more tasks and settings.
sent35: Li et al. (2021b) propose Token-Level Early-Exit that targets early exiting for sequence labeling.
sent36: They use the maximum class probability as confidence on a per-token basis.
sent37: Once the confidence hits the threshold, the hidden states of the corresponding tokens will be frozen and directly copied to upper layers.
sent38: These exited tokens will not attend to other tokens at upper layers but can still be attended by other tokens.
sent39: The model completely exits when every token exits.
sent40: A similar idea is also presented in Elbayad et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2021b) where hidden states of some positions can be frozen and directly copied to upper layers, although the former is focused on generation and the latter is for classification.
sent41: Xin et al. (2020a) apply DeeBERT (Xin et al., 2020b) to document ranking and set different thresholds to the negative and positive classes for early exiting, to accommodate the imbalanced class distribution in document ranking.
sent42: ELUE (Liu et al., 2021a) is a benchmark which evaluates the Pareto Front of early exit models on the FLOPs-performance plane.
sent43: They provide a BERT-like baseline with jointly pretrained internal classifiers, to mitigate the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning.","1. (What are the different internal classifier training exit criteria?): sent1

R2R is extended to create other VLN benchmarks.

Room-for-Room joins paths in R2R to create longer trajectories (Jain et al., 2019).","In Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, several benchmarks and datasets are commonly used to evaluate and train models. Some of the notable ones include:

1. **Room-to-Room (R2R)**: This dataset involves navigating through real-world indoor environments based on natural language instructions. It is one of the most widely used benchmarks in VLN.

2. **Room-for-Room (R4R)**: An extension of the R2R dataset, R4R includes longer and more complex navigation paths, providing a more challenging benchmark for VLN models.

3. **Touchdown**: This dataset focuses on urban outdoor environments, where the agent must navigate based on detailed natural language instructions. It is designed to test the model's ability to understand and follow complex instructions in a cityscape.

4. **CVDN (Cooperative Vision-and-Dialog Navigation)**: This dataset involves a collaborative task where an agent and a human interact through dialogue to achieve navigation goals. It emphasizes the role of interactive communication in navigation tasks.

5. **REVERIE (Remote Embodied Visual Referring Expressions)**: In this dataset, the agent is given a high-level instruction to find and identify a specific object in a remote environment, combining elements of object detection and navigation.

6. **RxR (Room-across-Room)**: This multilingual dataset provides navigation instructions in multiple languages, including English, Hindi, and Telugu, allowing for the evaluation of VLN models in a multilingual context.

These datasets and benchmarks are crucial for advancing research in VLN by providing diverse and challenging scenarios for training and evaluating navigation models.",What are some notable benchmarks and datasets derived from the R2R dataset used in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks?,What are some benchmarks and datasets derived from the R2R dataset used in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks?,"The R2R dataset was created by Anderson et al.

(2021) used TA-CRED to make a FSL RC dataset and compared it to FewRel 1.0 and FewRel 2.0, aiming at a more realistic scenario (i.e., non-uniform label distribution, inclusion of pronouns and common nouns).

All datasets so far present a sentence level annotation. To address this, Yao et al. (2019) published DocRED, a document-level RE dataset from Wikipedia and Wikidata. The difference with a traditional sentence-level corpus is that both the intraand inter-sentence relations are annotated, increasing the challenge level. In addition to RE, DocRED annotates coreference chains. DWIE by Zaporojets et al. (2021) is another document-level dataset, specifically designed for multi-task IE (Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Relation Extraction, and Entity Linking).

Lastly, there are works focusing on creating datasets for specific RE aspects. Cheng et al. (2021), for example, proposed a Chinese documentlevel RE dataset for hard cases in order to move towards even more challenging evaluation setups.

Domains in RE Given our analysis, we observe a shift in target domains: from news text in seminal works, over web texts, to emerging corpora in the scientific domain and the most recent focus on Wikipedia. Similarly, we observe the emerging trend for FSL.

Different datasets lend themselves to study different aspects of the task. Concerning crossdomain RE, we propose to distinguish three setups:

1. Data from different domains, but same relation types, which are general enough to be present in each domain (limited and often confined to the ACE dataset) (e.g., Plank and Moschitti, 2013).

The difference with a traditional sentence-level corpus is that both the intra- and inter-sentence relations are annotated, increasing the challenge level.","Relation extraction datasets are crucial for training and evaluating models that identify and classify relationships between entities in text. The main domains and characteristics of widely used relation extraction datasets include:

1. **Domains**:
   - **Biomedical**: Datasets like BioInfer, ADE (Adverse Drug Events), and ChemProt focus on extracting relationships between biomedical entities such as genes, proteins, diseases, and chemicals.
   - **News and General Text**: Datasets such as ACE (Automatic Content Extraction), TACRED (TAC Relation Extraction Dataset), and NYT (New York Times) are derived from news articles and general text, covering a wide range of entity types and relationships.
   - **Scientific Literature**: Datasets like SemEval and SciERC (Scientific Information Extraction from Research Articles) focus on extracting relationships from scientific papers, often in the fields of computer science and engineering.
   - **Social Media**: Datasets like TwitterRE are designed to extract relationships from social media posts, which often contain informal language and abbreviations.

2. **Characteristics**:
   - **Annotation Quality**: High-quality annotations are crucial for reliable training and evaluation. Datasets like TACRED and ACE are manually annotated by experts, ensuring high accuracy.
   - **Entity Types and Relations**: The number and variety of entity types and relations can vary significantly. For example, TACRED includes 41 relation types, while simpler datasets might focus on fewer, more specific relations.
   - **Size**: The size of the dataset, in terms of the number of annotated sentences or documents, can impact the robustness of the trained models. Larger datasets like NYT contain hundreds of thousands of sentences, while more specialized datasets might be smaller.
   - **Text Complexity**: The complexity of the text, including sentence structure and vocabulary, can vary. Biomedical and scientific literature datasets often contain more complex and domain-specific language compared to news or social media datasets.
   - **Availability and Licensing**: Some datasets are freely available for research purposes, while others may have restrictions or require special permissions. For example, the NYT dataset is available under specific licensing terms.

These domains and characteristics help in selecting the appropriate dataset for a given relation extraction task, ensuring that the models are trained and evaluated in a context that closely matches their intended application.","What are the main domains and characteristics of widely used relation extraction datasets, particularly those derived from news, scientific publications, and Wikipedia?","What are the main domains and characteristics of widely used relation extraction datasets, and how do they differ in terms of data sources and annotation complexity?","Widely used relation extraction (RE) datasets can be broadly classified into three domains based on the data source: (1) news and web, (2) scientific publications, and (3) Wikipedia.

248426721,What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction? A Survey on Datasets and Study on Scientific Relation Classification,Computer Science,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29a369d83a7d6a49f6a3259bee23bd4d95db0b16,s2,The Relation Extraction Task,"['p2.0', 'p2.1', 'p2.2']","['Conceptually, RE involves a pipeline of steps (see Figure 2). Starting from the raw text, the first step consists in identifying the entities and eventually assigning them a type. Entities involve either nominals or named entities, and hence it is either Named Entity Recognition (NER) or, more broadly, Mention Detection (MD). 5 After entities are identified, approaches start to be more blurry as studies have approached RE via different angles.', 'One way is to take two steps, Relation Identification (RI) and subsequent Relation Classification (RC) , as illustrated in Figure 2. This means to first identify from all the possible entity pairs the ones which are in some kind of relation via a binary classification task (RI). As the proportion of positive samples over the negative is usually extremely unbalanced towards the latter (Gormley et al., 2015), a priori heuristics are generally applied to reduce the possible combinations (e.g., entity pairs involving distant entities, or entity type pairs not licensed by the relations are not even considered). The last step (RC) is usually a multi-class classification to assign a relation type r to the positive samples from the previous step. Some studies merge RI and RC (Seganti et al., 2021) into one step, by adding a no-relation (no-rel) label. Other studies instead reduce the task to RC, and assume there exists a relation between two entities and the task is to determine the type (without a no-rel label). Regardless, RI is influenced by the RC setup: Relations which are not in the RC label set are considered as negative samples in the RI phase. Some studies address this approximation by distinguishing between the no-rel and the None-Of-The-Above (NOTA) relation (Gao et al., 2019). Note that, in our definition, the NOTA label differs from no-rel in the sense that a relation holds between the two entities, but its type is not in the considered RC label set. 6 What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction?

One way is to take two steps, Relation Identification (RI) and subsequent Relation Classification (RC) , as illustrated in Figure 2.

As the proportion of positive samples over the negative is usually extremely unbalanced towards the latter (Gormley et al., 2015), a priori heuristics are generally applied to reduce the possible combinations (e.g., entity pairs involving distant entities, or entity type pairs not licensed by the relations are not even considered).

Some studies merge RI and RC (Seganti et al., 2021) into one step, by adding a no-relation (no-rel) label. Other studies instead reduce the task to RC, and assume there exists a relation between two entities and the task is to determine the type (without a no-rel label).

The last step, Relation Classification (RC), is usually a multi-class classification to assign a relation type \( r \) to the positive samples from the previous step.","The main steps involved in the relation extraction (RE) pipeline typically include:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathering and preparing the text data for analysis. This may involve cleaning the text, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) to identify entities of interest.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from the text that can help in identifying relationships. This can include syntactic features (like dependency parses), semantic features, and contextual information.

3. **Model Training**: Using the extracted features to train a machine learning or deep learning model. This step involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, such as a support vector machine (SVM), random forest, or neural network, and training it on a labeled dataset where the relationships are already known.

4. **Relation Classification**: Applying the trained model to new, unseen text to classify the relationships between entities. This step involves predicting the type of relationship (if any) that exists between pairs of entities in the text.

5. **Post-processing and Evaluation**: Refining the extracted relationships and evaluating the performance of the model. This can involve filtering out low-confidence predictions, resolving conflicts, and using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the accuracy of the relation extraction.

6. **Integration and Application**: Integrating the extracted relationships into downstream applications or systems, such as knowledge graphs, question-answering systems, or information retrieval systems.

Each of these steps is crucial for building an effective relation extraction pipeline that can accurately identify and classify relationships in text data.","What are the main steps involved in the relation extraction (RE) pipeline, starting from raw text and including entity identification and relation classification?","What are the main steps involved in the relation extraction (RE) pipeline, specifically focusing on entity identification and relation classification?","Starting from the raw text, the first step in the relation extraction (RE) pipeline is to identify the entities and assign them a type, which involves either Named Entity Recognition (NER) or Mention Detection (MD).

sent17: 6 Some studies name such relation Other (Hendrickx et al., 2010). analyze all the ACL papers published in the last five years which contain the Relation Extraction keyword in the title and determine which sub-task is performed (NER/MD, RI, RC).
sent18: Table 2 shows such investigation.
sent19: We leave out from this analysis (a) papers which make use of distant supervision or which somehow involve knowledge bases, (b) shared task papers, (c) the bioNLP field, (d) temporal RE, and (e) Open RE.
sent20: The result shows that gold entities are usually assumed for RE, presumably given the complexity of the NER/MD task on its own.
sent21: Most importantly, for end-to-end models, recent work has shown that ablations for steps like NER are lacking (Taillé et al., 2020).
sent22: Our analysis further shows that it is difficult to determine the RI setup.
sent23: While RC is always performed, the situation is different for RI (or no-rel).
sent24: Sometimes RI is clearly not done (i.e., the paper assumes a scenario in which every instance contains at least one relation), but most of the times it is either not clear from the paper, or done in a simplified scenario (e.g., datasets which already clear out most of the no-rel entity pair instances).
sent25: As this blurriness hampers fair evaluation, we propose that studies clearly state which step they include, i.e., whether the work focus is on RC, RI+RC or the full RE pipeline and how special cases (no-rel and NOTA) are handled.
sent26: These details are utterly important as they impact both model estimation and evaluation.
sent27: Pipeline or Joint Model? The traditional RE pipeline is, by definition of pipeline, prone to error propagation by sub-tasks.
sent28: Joint entity and relation extraction approaches have been proposed in order to alleviate this problem (Miwa and Bansal, 2016;Zhang et al., 2017a;Bekoulis et al., 2018a,b;Wang and Lu, 2020;Wang et al., 2021).
sent29: However, Taillé et al. (2020) recently discussed the challenge of properly evaluating such complex models.
sent30: They surveyed the evaluation metrics of recently published works on end-to-end RE referring to the Strict, Boundaries, Relaxed evaluation setting pro-  posed by Bekoulis et al. (2018a).
sent31: They observe unfair comparisons and overestimations of end-toend models, and claim the need for more rigorous reports of evaluation settings, including detailed datasets statistics.
sent32: While some recent work shifts to joint models, it is still an open question which approach (joint or pipeline) is the most robust.
sent33: Zhong and Chen (2021) found that when incorporating modern pretrained language models (e.g., BERT) using separate encoders can surpass existing joint models.
sent34: Since the output label space is different, separate encoders could better capture distinct contextual information.
sent35: At the moment it is not clear if one approach is more suitable than the other for RE.
sent36: For this reason and because of our final goal, which is a closer look to sub-domains in the scientific field, we follow the pipeline approach and, following most work from Table 2, we here restrict the setup by focusing on the RC task.","# QUA Analysis:

If we take the abstractive summary from Figure 1 (""Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material"") as a gold example, ROUGE would assign a higher score to a system that produces ""Some part of the casing will be made of broccoli"" than one that output ""A portion of the outer layer will be constructed from a sponge-like material,"" even though the latter is a perfect reformulation of the gold summary, while the former says something very different (and false).",,"Questions:

What are the limitations of using the ROUGE metric for evaluating abstractive meeting summaries?

Answer:

None","The ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) metric, while widely used for evaluating the quality of text summaries, has several limitations when applied to abstractive meeting summaries:

1. **Surface-Level Matching**: ROUGE primarily measures the overlap of n-grams, words, and sequences between the generated summary and reference summaries. This focus on surface-level matching can miss the deeper semantic content and coherence of the summary, which is crucial for abstractive summaries that may use different wording to convey the same meaning.

2. **Lack of Context Understanding**: ROUGE does not account for the context or the importance of different pieces of information. In meeting summaries, some points may be more critical than others, and ROUGE cannot differentiate between more and less important content.

3. **Inflexibility with Paraphrasing**: Abstractive summaries often involve paraphrasing and rephrasing of the original content. ROUGE may penalize valid paraphrases that do not match the exact wording of the reference summaries, leading to potentially lower scores for high-quality summaries.

4. **Single Reference Limitation**: ROUGE typically relies on one or a few reference summaries. Given the subjective nature of summarization, multiple valid summaries can exist for the same content. A single reference summary may not capture all valid ways to summarize a meeting, leading to biased evaluations.

5. **Neglect of Coherence and Readability**: ROUGE does not evaluate the coherence, fluency, or readability of the summary. A summary with high n-gram overlap might still be poorly structured or difficult to read, which ROUGE would not penalize.

6. **Inability to Capture Novel Information**: Abstractive summaries might introduce novel information or insights derived from the meeting content. ROUGE, focusing on overlap with reference summaries, may not adequately reward such novel contributions.

These limitations suggest that while ROUGE can provide some insights into the quality of abstractive meeting summaries, it should be complemented with other evaluation methods, such as human judgment or metrics that consider semantic similarity and coherence.",What are the specific limitations of using the ROUGE metric for evaluating the quality of abstractive meeting summaries?,What are the specific limitations of using the ROUGE metric for evaluating the quality of abstractive meeting summaries?,,"Questions:

What are the specific limitations of using the ROUGE metric for evaluating the quality of abstractive meeting summaries?

Answer:

nan",,"sent1: As noted in Section 2, the subjectivity of meeting summaries, stemming in part from the preference for abstractive summarization, complicates the evaluation task.
sent2: Evaluation requires both verifying that the content in a system-based summary follows from the original transcript and measuring the overlap with a gold-standard summary.
sent3: However, given the expressive freedom encouraged by abstractive approaches, checking for semantic entailment and overlap of summary-worthy content requires deep semantic understanding, not just recognition that the same words are used.
sent4: Unfortunately, the ROUGE metric (Lin, 2004), which remains the standard for both meeting and general text summarization, scores systemproduced summaries based purely on surface lexicographic matches with a (usually single) gold summary, making it unideal for assessing abstractive summaries.
sent5: If we take the abstractive summary from Figure 1 (""Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material"") as a gold example, ROUGE would assign a higher score to a system that produces ""Some part of the casing will be made of broccoli"" than one that output ""A portion of the outer layer will be constructed from a sponge-like material,"" even though the latter is a perfect reformulation of the gold summary, while the former says something very different (and false).
sent6: A reasonable way to try to improve over ROUGE would be to take advantage of massive, pretrained, contextual word embeddings and a notion of lexical similarity rather than strict lexical overlap.
sent7: Some recent efforts pursue this direction (Sai et al., 2022), including BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020a) and MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019a), which aim to measure the semantic distance between the contextualized mapping of a generated summary and the reference, or BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021), which calculates the log-likelihood of a summary to have been generated, motivated by the fact that a good summary should have a high probability of being generated from a source text.
sent8: Building upon these methods, DATScore and FrugalScore (Eddine et al., 2022;Kamal Eddine et al., 2022) incorporate data augmentation and knowledge distillation techniques to further improve performance and overcome their drawbacks.
sent9: Despite their rapid development, recent studies on meta-evaluation of these metrics show mixed results.
sent10: Peyrard (2019) and Bhandari et al. (2020a) compare their performance in the context of document summarization and show that metrics strongly disagree in ranking summaries from any narrow scoring range, e.g., there is no consensus among metrics regarding which summary is better than another in the high scoring range in which modern systems now operate.
sent11: Bhandari et al. (2020b) argue that there is no one-size-fitsall metric that correlates better with human judgement than the others, and that can outperform others on all datasets.
sent12: Clearly, evaluation is itself a very challenging task.
sent13: And we note that none of these metrics even touches on another central challenge for summary evaluation, namely that of factual consistency.
sent14: When we summarize a meeting or detail decisions and actions items in our own words, it is important to get the facts straight.
sent15: Otherwise, the resulting summaries are not reliable for an end user.
sent16: While we do not know of current work that focuses on evaluation of factuality explicitly for the meeting domain, the study of factual consistency in summarization more generally is a budding research area that we discuss in Section 6.
sent17: In the absence of a clear winner for summary evaluation metrics, none of the alternatives has yet to be widely adopted.
sent18: In our comparison of different summarization systems in Section 5, we therefore stick with ROUGE, which offers the additional advantage of conceptual simplicity and lower computational cost compared to metrics based on contextual embeddings and pretrained language models.","1.

In particular, dialogue acts of the type inform are more closely linked to summary-worthy material than acts such as stall or assess.","Discourse structures and dialogue acts play a crucial role in abstractive meeting summarization by providing a framework to understand and organize the content of the meeting. 

1. **Discourse Structures**: These refer to the overall organization and flow of the conversation. By identifying the discourse structure, summarization systems can determine the main topics, subtopics, and the relationships between different parts of the conversation. This helps in creating a coherent and logically structured summary that captures the essence of the meeting.

2. **Dialogue Acts**: These are the functional units of conversation, such as questions, answers, agreements, disagreements, suggestions, and so on. By recognizing and categorizing these acts, the summarization system can better understand the intentions and contributions of each participant. This allows the system to highlight key points, decisions, and action items, making the summary more informative and relevant.

Together, discourse structures and dialogue acts enable the summarization system to filter out irrelevant information, focus on important content, and generate a concise and meaningful summary that accurately reflects the main points and outcomes of the meeting.","How do theories like Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) and Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT), along with dialogue act labels, contribute to improving abstractive meeting summarization?",How do independent theories of discourse structure and dialogue act labels contribute to improving abstractive meeting summarization?,"Independent theories of discourse structure, such as Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST; Mann and Thompson, 1987) and Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT; Asher, 1993; Lascarides and Asher, 2008), contribute to improving abstractive meeting summarization by emphasizing the importance of semantic relations between conversational units. These theories suggest that each clause-level unit in a coherent conversation should be semantically related to other parts of the conversation through discourse relations like Question-Answer Pair (QAP), Acknowledgement (Ack), Explanation, or Contrast. This relational structure can be represented as a weakly-connected graph, which can then be used to generate more coherent and contextually accurate summaries.

For instance, Feng et al. (2020) utilize discourse graphs derived from a sequential discourse parser trained on the STAC corpus to enhance summarization for the AMI and ICSI meeting corpora. Their approach involves transforming graph edges labeled with discourse relations into vertices and using a graph convolutional network encoder along with a PGN decoder to generate summaries.

On the other hand, dialogue act classification offers a different approach by focusing on labeling interactive acts within the conversation, such as stalling, assessing, suggesting, or informing. Systems like DAMSL and DiAML emphasize these interactive acts without requiring a full graph structure.

VFOA refers to where participants are looking, which can indicate their focus of attention, interest, and involvement in the discussion. By analyzing VFOA, these systems can:

1. **Identify Key Speakers and Listeners**: Determine who is actively speaking and who is paying attention, which helps in understanding the dynamics of the conversation.
2. **Contextualize Speech**: Enhance the interpretation of spoken content by correlating it with visual cues, such as who the speaker is addressing or who is reacting to the speech.
3. **Detect Important Moments**: Recognize significant events or shifts in the meeting, such as when multiple participants focus on a single speaker or visual aid, indicating a critical point in the discussion.
4. **Improve Summarization Accuracy**: Combine visual and auditory data to create more comprehensive and accurate summaries, capturing not just what was said but also the non-verbal cues that provide additional meaning.

In summary, VFOA enriches the multimodal analysis by integrating visual attention data with audio and textual information, leading to more effective and insightful meeting summaries.",What is the significance of Visual Focus Of Attention (VFOA) in enhancing the effectiveness of multimodal meeting summarization systems?,What is the significance of Visual Focus Of Attention (VFOA) in enhancing the accuracy and context of multimodal meeting summarization systems?,,"Questions:

What is the significance of Visual Focus Of Attention (VFOA) in enhancing the accuracy and context of multimodal meeting summarization systems?

Answer:

nan",,"sent1: Meetings tend to take place in shared visual contexts, allowing important information to be conveyed through gestures, facial expressions, head poses, eye gaze, and so on.
sent2: It is thus reasonable to think that harnessing this information could lead to improved performance over a summarization system that draws on speech transcripts alone.
sent3: Indeed, Li et al. (2019) has shown that the Visual Focus Of Attention (VFOA), which is estimated based on a participant's head orientation and eye gaze, can help a multi-modal summarization system determine salient utterances, thereby improving the quality of abstractive meeting summaries.
sent4: In this work, VFOA is integrated with attention mechanisms in a PGN text decoder and topic segmenter trained in a multi-task learning setting.
sent5: In the context of extractive meeting summarization, Erol et al. (2003) exploits multimodality to select segments of meeting video recordings in order to facilitate browsing of the videos for important information.
sent6: Along with TF-IDF text analysis of the speech transcript, their system attends to certain visual motion activities (e.g., someone entering the meeting room or standing up to make a presentation) and to acoustic features (e.g., speech volume and degree of interaction) to enhance detection of summary-worthy events.
sent7: Similar ideas can be found in Xie and Liu (2010);Nihei et al. (2016Nihei et al. ( , 2018; Nihei and Nakano (2019).
sent8: Of course, enhancing meeting transcripts with information to improve interpretation comes at a cost: most annotations are performed manually and require linguistic expertise to do well, and annotations produced automatically, as in Shi and Huang (2019) or Shang et al. (2020b), can add uncertainties to the data.
sent9: It is perhaps thus unsurprising that the last couple of years have seen a shift away from Interpretation-focused methods presented in this section towards Generation methods, as shown in Table 1.
sent10: Still, certain approaches showed promising results, especially Feng et al.(2020) and Li et al. (2019), and arguably, Interpretation approaches offer other advantages that should encourage us to explore them further.
sent11: Discourse graphs, for example, can provide input to graph-based networks, helping to bypass limits on input document length imposed by some Generation approaches (see Section 5.3).
sent12: And a rich source representation can arguably make a single transcript more valuable for training, partially offsetting data scarcity described in Section 3.","1. (What is the role of shared visual contexts in meetings?): sent1

What factors contribute to the complexity of SQL queries and natural language utterances in text-to-SQL tasks?

Answer:

The complexity of SQL queries is defined by the number of SQL components (Yu et al., 2018c).

The SQL query becomes more complex when it contains additional SQL keywords such as GROUP BY and nested subqueries.

Intuitively, models' performance can decrease when faced with longer questions from users.

Additionally, there can be domain-specific phrases that confuse the model in both short and long utterances (Suhr et al., 2020).","The complexity of SQL queries and natural language utterances in text-to-SQL tasks can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Query Length and Structure**: Longer and more nested SQL queries are inherently more complex. Queries involving multiple joins, subqueries, and various SQL clauses (e.g., WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING) add to the complexity.

2. **Natural Language Ambiguity**: Natural language is often ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways. This ambiguity makes it challenging to accurately map the natural language utterance to a precise SQL query.

3. **Schema Complexity**: The complexity of the database schema, including the number of tables, relationships between tables, and the presence of foreign keys, can make the task more difficult. A more complex schema requires a deeper understanding to generate correct SQL queries.

4. **Domain-Specific Language**: Different domains may have specific terminologies and concepts that need to be understood and correctly translated into SQL. This requires domain knowledge and the ability to handle domain-specific language.

5. **Context and Co-reference Resolution**: Understanding the context of the query and resolving references to previous parts of the conversation or document can add to the complexity. This is especially true in multi-turn interactions where the context evolves over time.

6. **Synonyms and Paraphrasing**: Natural language allows for multiple ways to express the same query. The system must recognize synonyms and different phrasings to generate the correct SQL query.

7. **Logical Reasoning**: Some queries require logical reasoning to understand the relationships and constraints implied by the natural language utterance. This includes understanding conditions, comparisons, and aggregations.

8. **Error Handling and Robustness**: The system must handle incomplete, incorrect, or vague natural language inputs gracefully and still attempt to generate a meaningful SQL query.

Addressing these factors requires sophisticated natural language processing techniques, a deep understanding of SQL, and often, domain-specific knowledge.","What factors contribute to the complexity of SQL queries, particularly in terms of SQL components and domain-specific phrases, in text-to-SQL tasks?","What factors contribute to the complexity of SQL queries, particularly when additional SQL keywords like GROUP BY and nested subqueries are involved?","The complexity of SQL queries is defined by the number of SQL components (Yu et al., 2018c).

Answer:

None","In text-to-SQL evaluation, common methods for splitting datasets typically include:

1. **Random Split**: The dataset is randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets. This method ensures that each subset is representative of the overall dataset.

2. **Schema Split**: The dataset is split based on database schemas. This means that the training, validation, and test sets contain queries from different databases. This method tests the model's ability to generalize to new schemas it hasn't seen during training.

3. **Query Split**: The dataset is split based on the complexity or type of SQL queries. For example, simple queries might be in the training set, while more complex queries are in the test set. This method evaluates the model's performance on varying levels of query difficulty.

4. **Cross-Domain Split**: The dataset is divided such that the training and test sets come from different domains or application areas. This method assesses the model's ability to generalize across different domains.

Answer:

Graph-based methods are used to better encode the rich structural information contained in DB schemas.

Specifically, Bogin et al. (2019a) use nodes to represent tables and columns, edges to represent relationships between tables and columns, such as tables containing columns, primary key, and foreign key constraints, and then use graph neural networks (GNNs) (Li et al., 2016) to encode the graph structure.

In their subsequent work, Bogin et al. (2019b) use a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture DB structures and a gated GCN to select the relevant DB information for SQL generation.","Graph-based methods are used to encode database (DB) schemas in text-to-SQL tasks by representing the schema as a graph where nodes correspond to database entities such as tables and columns, and edges represent relationships between these entities, such as foreign key constraints or table-column associations. This graphical representation allows for a more structured and interconnected understanding of the schema, which can be leveraged by machine learning models to better interpret and generate SQL queries based on natural language input.

In more detail, the process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Node Representation**: Each table and column in the database schema is represented as a node in the graph. Nodes can be enriched with additional information such as data types, primary keys, and other metadata.

2. **Edge Representation**: Edges are created to represent relationships between nodes. For example, an edge might connect a table node to its column nodes, or it might connect two table nodes that have a foreign key relationship.

3. **Graph Encoding**: The graph is then encoded using techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or other graph-based algorithms. These techniques can capture the structural and relational information inherent in the graph, providing a rich representation of the schema.

4. **Integration with Text**: The encoded graph representation of the schema is integrated with the natural language input (the user's query) to form a combined representation. This can be done using various neural network architectures that can process both text and graph data.

5. **Query Generation**: The combined representation is used to generate the SQL query. The model leverages the structured schema information from the graph to ensure that the generated SQL query is syntactically and semantically correct with respect to the database schema.

By using graph-based methods, text-to-SQL models can more effectively understand the complex relationships within a database schema, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate SQL query generation.","How do graph-based methods encode the structural information of DB schemas in text-to-SQL tasks, and what specific techniques are used to achieve this?","How are graph-based methods specifically used to encode DB schemas in text-to-SQL tasks, and what techniques are employed to capture and utilize the structural information?","Graph-based methods are employed to encode the rich structural information in DB schemas by representing the schemas as graphs where nodes correspond to tables and columns, and edges represent relationships such as tables containing columns, primary key, and foreign key constraints.

New Tasks: Inspiration from Sarcasm##
Compared to sarcasm, irony is rarely seen as a term in NLP conferences. Recently we have witnessed great improvements in sarcasm processing and in this part we will discuss how new tasks in sarcasm could motivate irony research.

Data Collection As discussed, datasets are highly dependent on hashtags as a signal to extract ironical expressions. Shmueli et al. (2020) proposed an algorithm to detect sarcastic tweets from a thread based on exterior cue tweets. A distant supervision based method for extracting ironies from platforms is crucial, given ironies in conversational contexts are central topic in the future.

Intended and Perceived Irony Oprea and Magdy (2019) explored how author profiling affected the perceived sarcasm (manual labelling) versus the intended sarcasm (hashtags), and verified the difference between both. Further, Oprea and Magdy (2020) introduced iSarcasm dataset which divided intended sarcasms and perceived sarcasms. The state-of-the-art sarcasm detection models performed obviously worse than human evaluation on this dataset. Future work could focus on multimodal perceived and intended irony, especially across various cultures.

Target Identification Sarcasm target identification was firstly proposed in Joshi et al. (2018), in which sarcasm targets were classified as one target, several targets and outside. Patro et al. (2019) introduced sociolinguistic features and a deep learning framework, and improved target identification by a lot. For irony processing, most ironical expressions do not equip a specific target in itself as previously discussed. However, its ironical effects are likely in dialogue or visually grounded environment, which encourages us to enhance irony datasets in aforementioned ways.

Irony Explanation Irony, according to the definition, have opposite real meanings to literal meanings. However, this does not mean adding a single negation could interpret ironies well. Kumar et al. (2022) proposed a new task, sarcasm explanation in dialogue. Irony explanation might encounter more complex problems due to relatively low proportion of targets.

Irony explanation might encounter more complex problems due to relatively low proportion of targets.",,"Questions:

What are the challenges in processing irony compared to sarcasm in NLP?

Answer:

None","The challenges in processing irony compared to sarcasm in Natural Language Processing (NLP) primarily revolve around the subtleties and context-dependent nature of these forms of expression. Here are some key points:

1. **Subtlety and Context**:
   - **Irony**: Often relies on a discrepancy between the literal meaning and the intended meaning, which can be highly context-dependent and subtle. Detecting irony requires understanding the broader context, including cultural and situational nuances.
   - **Sarcasm**: While also context-dependent, sarcasm tends to be more direct and often includes cues like exaggerated tone or specific phrasing that can be easier to identify.

2. **Linguistic Cues**:
   - **Irony**: May not have clear linguistic markers and can be expressed in a variety of ways, making it harder to detect using standard NLP techniques.
   - **Sarcasm**: Often includes more recognizable patterns, such as hyperbole, specific syntactic structures, or common sarcastic phrases, which can be more easily identified by algorithms.

3. **Annotation and Training Data**:
   - **Irony**: Creating annotated datasets for irony detection is challenging because it requires annotators to understand and agree on the intended meaning, which can be subjective.
   - **Sarcasm**: While still subjective, sarcasm can be more straightforward to annotate due to its more overt nature.

4. **Algorithmic Complexity**:
   - **Irony**: Requires more sophisticated models that can understand and interpret nuanced language, context, and sometimes even world knowledge.
   - **Sarcasm**: Although complex, sarcasm detection can sometimes be approached with pattern recognition and sentiment analysis techniques that are more developed in NLP.

5. **Cultural and Social Factors**:
   - **Irony**: Can vary significantly across different cultures and social contexts, making it harder to create universal models.
   - **Sarcasm**: While also culturally influenced, the exaggerated and often negative tone of sarcasm can be more universally recognized.

In summary, while both irony and sarcasm present challenges for NLP, irony is generally more difficult to process due to its subtlety, context-dependence, and lack of clear linguistic markers. Sarcasm, though still challenging, often provides more explicit cues that can be leveraged by NLP systems.",What specific challenges does NLP face in processing irony compared to sarcasm?,What are the specific challenges in processing irony compared to sarcasm in NLP?,,"Questions:

Key developments include:

1. **Deep Learning Models**: The use of advanced deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers has enhanced the ability to capture complex patterns and contextual information across different modalities.

2. **Multimodal Fusion Techniques**: Improved methods for effectively combining information from multiple modalities have been developed. Techniques such as attention mechanisms and late fusion strategies help in better aligning and integrating data from text, audio, and visual sources.

3. **Pre-trained Multimodal Models**: The adaptation of pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and their multimodal counterparts (e.g., VisualBERT, VideoBERT) has provided a strong foundation for sarcasm detection tasks, allowing models to leverage large-scale pre-training on diverse datasets.

4. **Contextual Understanding**: Enhanced methods for understanding context, such as incorporating background knowledge and user-specific information, have improved the detection of sarcasm, which often relies heavily on context.

5. **Datasets and Benchmarks**: The creation of large, annotated multimodal datasets specifically designed for sarcasm detection has facilitated better training and evaluation of models. These datasets often include synchronized text, audio, and visual data from social media, video platforms, and other sources.

6. **Cross-modal Consistency**: Techniques to ensure consistency and coherence across different modalities have been developed, helping models to better understand when sarcasm is present by cross-referencing cues from multiple sources.

Answer:

Sarcasm is often recognized as ""a nasty, mean-spirited, or just relatively negative form of verbal irony, used on occasion to enhance the negativity expressed relative to direct, non-figurative criticism"" (Colston, 2017).

Kumon-Nakamura et al. (1995), for example, believe that sarcastic irony always conveys a negative attitude and is intended to harm the object being discussed.

Filik et al. (2019) utilized fMRI and found that sarcasm is associated with wider activation of the semantic network in human brains compared to irony.","The key differences between sarcasm and irony, according to linguistic and cognitive studies, can be summarized as follows:

1. **Definition and Intent**:
   - **Irony**: Irony involves saying something that is opposite to what is meant, often to highlight a discrepancy between appearance and reality. It is a broader concept that can be used in various contexts, including literature, everyday conversation, and rhetorical speech.
   - **Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony that is specifically intended to mock or convey contempt. It often involves a sharper, more cutting tone and is directed at a person or situation to ridicule or criticize.

2. **Tone and Delivery**:
   - **Irony**: The tone of irony can be subtle and may not always be immediately apparent. It relies on the context and the listener's ability to recognize the incongruity between the literal and intended meaning.
   - **Sarcasm**: Sarcasm typically has a more obvious and exaggerated tone, often accompanied by vocal cues such as a sneering or mocking intonation. The delivery is usually more pointed and direct.

3. **Cognitive Processing**:
   - **Irony**: Understanding irony requires recognizing the contrast between what is said and the actual situation. It involves higher-level cognitive processing to detect the underlying meaning and the context in which it is used.
   - **Sarcasm**: Sarcasm also requires recognizing the contrast, but it additionally involves interpreting social and emotional cues to understand the speaker's intent to mock or criticize. This can make sarcasm more complex to process, especially for individuals with certain cognitive or social communication difficulties.

4. **Social Function**:
   - **Irony**: Irony can serve various functions, such as humor, criticism, or emphasizing a point. It can be used in a more detached or impersonal manner.
   - **Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is more socially aggressive and is often used to assert dominance, express frustration, or convey disdain. It is more personal and can affect social relationships more directly.

In summary, while both sarcasm and irony involve saying something contrary to what is meant, sarcasm is a more specific, cutting form of verbal irony with a clear intent to mock or criticize, characterized by a distinct tone and delivery. Irony, on the other hand, is a broader concept that can be used in various contexts and may not always carry the same sharpness or social implications as sarcasm.",What are the key differences between sarcasm and irony according to linguistic and cognitive research findings?,"What are the key differences between sarcasm and irony according to linguistic and cognitive studies, particularly in terms of intent and social impact?","Sarcasm is often recognized as ""a nasty, mean-spirited, or just relatively negative form of verbal irony, used on occasion to enhance the negativity expressed relative to direct, non-figurative criticism"" (Colston, 2017).

Ontology construction involves coming up with the rules and schemes of KGs, i.e., their structure and format of knowledge presented in it (Haussmann et al., 2019).","Constructing knowledge graphs involves several key tasks, including:

1. **Data Collection and Integration**: Gathering data from various sources such as databases, text documents, web pages, and APIs. This data needs to be integrated into a unified format suitable for building a knowledge graph.

2. **Entity Extraction**: Identifying and extracting entities (such as people, places, organizations, etc.) from the collected data. This often involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

3. **Entity Resolution**: Resolving ambiguities and ensuring that each entity is uniquely identified, even if it appears in different forms or contexts across the data sources.

4. **Relationship Extraction**: Identifying and extracting relationships between entities. This can involve parsing sentences to understand how entities are related or using structured data to find connections.

5. **Schema Design**: Defining the structure of the knowledge graph, including the types of entities, relationships, and attributes that will be represented.

6. **Data Cleaning and Normalization**: Ensuring the data is accurate, consistent, and free of duplicates or errors. This may involve standardizing formats, correcting errors, and filling in missing values.

7. **Ontology Development**: Creating an ontology that defines the categories, properties, and relationships within the knowledge graph. This helps in organizing the data and making it more interpretable.

8. **Graph Construction**: Building the actual graph structure where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships. This involves populating the graph with the extracted and processed data.

9. **Validation and Quality Assurance**: Checking the knowledge graph for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. This may involve manual review, automated validation rules, and consistency checks.

10. **Maintenance and Updating**: Continuously updating the knowledge graph with new data and ensuring it remains current and relevant. This includes handling changes in the underlying data sources and evolving the schema as needed.

11. **Querying and Access**: Implementing mechanisms for querying the knowledge graph, such as SPARQL endpoints or APIs, to allow users and applications to retrieve and use the information stored in the graph.

These tasks collectively ensure that the knowledge graph is comprehensive, accurate, and useful for various applications such as search, recommendation systems, and data analysis.",What are the essential steps in extracting and organizing entities and relationships for constructing knowledge graphs?,What are the key tasks involved in extracting and linking entities when constructing knowledge graphs?,"Entity extraction is the initial task in constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) and is used to derive real-world entities from unstructured text (Al-Moslmi et al., 2020).

Question answering (QA) was found to be the most common NLP task using KGs. This task is typically divided into textual QA and question answering over knowledge bases (KBQA). Textual QA derives answers from unstructured documents while KBQA does so from predefined knowledge bases (Fu et al., 2020). KBQA is naturally tied to KGs while textual QA can also be approached by using KGs as a source of common-sense knowledge when answering questions. As Zhu et al. (2021) conclude, this approach is desired not only because it is helpful for generating answers, but also because it makes answers more interpretable.

Semantic search refers to ""search with meaning"", where the goal is not just to search for literal matches, but to understand the search intent and query context as well (Bast et al., 2016). This label denoted studies that use KGs for search, recommendations, and analytics. Examples are a big semantic network of everyday concepts called ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) and a KG of scholarly communications and the relationships, among them the Microsoft Academic Graph .

Conversational interfaces constitute another NLP field that can benefit from world knowledge contained in KGs. Zhou et al. (2018)  Natural language generation (NLG) is a subfield of NLP and computational linguistics that is concerned with models which generate natural language output from scratch. KGs are used in this subfield for producing natural language text from KGs (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2019), generating question-answer pairs (Reddy et al., 2017), the multi-modal task of image captioning (Lu et al., 2018), or data augmentation in low-resource settings (Sharifirad et al., 2018).

Text analysis combines various analytical NLP techniques and methods that are applied to process and understand textual data. Exemplary tasks are sentiment detection (Kumar et al., 2018), topic modeling , or word sense disambiguation .

Augmented language models are a combination of large pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT (Radford et al., 2018) with knowledge contained in KGs. Since PLMs derive their knowledge from huge amounts of unstructured training data, a rising research trend is in combining them with structured knowledge. Knowledge from KGs can be infused into language models in their input, architecture, output, or some combination thereof (Colon-Hernandez et al., 2021). Some notable examples we outline are ERNIE (Zhang et al., 2019b), COMET (Bosselut et al., 2019), K-BERT (Liu et al., 2020b), and KEPLER (Wang et al., 2021b). Table 3 shows the distribution of papers according to the different research and contribution types as defined in Table 4 and 5 in the Appendix. It shows that most papers conduct validation research, investigating new techniques or methods that have not yet been implemented in practice. A considerable number of papers, although significantly less, focus on solution proposals of approaches by demonstrating their advantages and applicability by a small example or argumentation. However, these papers usually lack a profound empirical evaluation. Secondary research accounts for only a small number of papers and is severely underrepresented in the research field of KGs in NLP. As already mentioned in Section 1 and Section 2, there is a notable lack of studies that summarize, compile, or synthesize existing research regarding KGs in NLP. Moreover, evaluation research papers that implement and evaluate approaches in an industry context are equally scarce. Opinion papers are almost non-existent.",False,"

Especially in the case of ongoing crowdsourcing efforts for encyclopedic KGs the demographic background of contributors should be reported (Demartini, 2019). Researchers using subsets of these KGs, should investigate respective data dumps for potential biases and report limitations transparently. Similarly, KG embedding models should be published with Model Cards (Mitchell et al., 2019) documenting intended use, underlying data, ethical considerations, and limitations. Stating the contact details for reporting problems and concerns establishes accountability (Mitchell et al., 2019;Gebru et al., 2021).

Improving Representativeness To tackle selection bias, data collection should aim to employ authors and annotators from diverse social groups and with varied cultural imprints. Annotations should be determined via aggregation (see Hovy and Prabhumoye, 2021). For open editable KGs, interventions like edit-a-thons are helpful to introduce more authors from underrepresented groups (Vetter et al., 2022) (e.g., the Art+Feminism campaign aims to fill the gender gap in Wikimedia knowledge bases 8 ). In order for such interventions to take effect, research must update data bases and benchmarks frequently (see Koch et al., 2021). In addition, the timeliness of encyclopedic data is necessary to avoid perpetuating historic biases.

Tackling Algorithmic Bias Evaluation and prevention of harmful biases must become part of the development pipeline (Stanczak and Augenstein, 2021). Algorithmic biases are best evaluated with a combination of multiple quantitative (Section 5) and qualitative measures (Kraft et al., 2022;Dev et al., 2021), considering multiple demographic dimensions (beyond gender and occupation). Evaluating the content of attributions in light of social discourse and the intended use of a technology facilitates an assessment of potential harms (Selbst et al., 2019). Downstream task bias may exist independently from a measured embedding bias (Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2021), therefore a taskand context-oriented evaluation is preferred (Section 6). We have presented several bias-mitigating strategies for different KGEs, which might alleviate the issue in some cases (Section 7). However, more research is needed to establish more effective and robust mitigation methods, as well as metrics used to evaluate their impact (Gonen and Goldberg, 2019;Blodgett et al., 2020).",False,"

Algorithmic biases are best evaluated with a combination of multiple quantitative and qualitative measures (Kraft et al., 2022; Dev et al., 2021), considering multiple demographic dimensions beyond gender and occupation.","To avoid harms caused by biases in knowledge graphs and their embeddings, the following actions are recommended:

1. **Bias Detection and Measurement**: Implement methods to detect and measure biases within the knowledge graph and its embeddings. This involves identifying and quantifying biases related to gender, race, ethnicity, and other sensitive attributes.

2. **Data Curation and Preprocessing**: Carefully curate and preprocess the data used to construct the knowledge graph. This includes removing or correcting biased information and ensuring a diverse and representative dataset.

3. **Fair Representation Learning**: Develop and use algorithms that promote fair representation learning. These algorithms should be designed to mitigate biases during the embedding process.

4. **Regular Audits and Monitoring**: Conduct regular audits and continuous monitoring of the knowledge graph and its embeddings to identify and address any emerging biases.

5. **Transparency and Explainability**: Ensure transparency in the construction and maintenance of the knowledge graph. Provide explanations for the decisions made by the embeddings to allow users to understand and trust the system.

6. **User Feedback and Iteration**: Incorporate user feedback to identify biases and iteratively improve the knowledge graph and its embeddings. Engage with diverse user groups to gather comprehensive feedback.

7. **Ethical Guidelines and Standards**: Adhere to ethical guidelines and industry standards for fairness and bias mitigation in AI and machine learning systems.

8. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Collaborate with experts from various fields, including ethics, social sciences, and law, to address biases comprehensively and from multiple perspectives.

By implementing these actions, developers and researchers can work towards minimizing the harms caused by biases in knowledge graphs and their embeddings, leading to more fair and equitable AI systems.","What specific measures should be taken to document, evaluate, and mitigate biases in knowledge graphs and their embeddings?",What actions are recommended to ensure transparency and mitigate biases in the development and use of knowledge graphs and their embeddings?,"To ensure transparency and mitigate biases in the development and use of knowledge graphs (KGs) and their embeddings, the following actions are recommended:

What are the identified sources of predictive biases in knowledge graphs?

Answer:

None","The identified sources of predictive biases in knowledge graphs include:

1. **Data Imbalance**: This occurs when certain entities or relationships are overrepresented or underrepresented in the knowledge graph, leading to biased predictions.
2. **Schema Limitations**: The structure and constraints of the knowledge graph schema can introduce biases, especially if they do not accurately reflect the real-world complexities.
3. **Historical Bias**: Biases present in the original data sources from which the knowledge graph is constructed can propagate into the knowledge graph.
4. **Algorithmic Bias**: The algorithms used for knowledge graph completion and inference can introduce biases based on their design and the training data they use.
5. **Human Bias**: Biases introduced by human curators during the creation and maintenance of the knowledge graph.

These sources can affect the accuracy and fairness of predictions made using knowledge graphs.",What are the different sources of predictive biases that can affect the accuracy and fairness of knowledge graphs?,What are the main sources of predictive biases identified in knowledge graphs?,,"Questions:

The introduction of attention scores to the spatial convolution allows the model to explicitly assign importance to certain nodes and their messages.","Spatial convolution in graph neural networks (GNNs) for text summarization involves applying convolutional operations directly on the graph structure that represents the text. Here's how it works:

1. **Graph Construction**: First, the text is converted into a graph where nodes represent text units (such as words, sentences, or paragraphs) and edges represent relationships or dependencies between these units. For example, in a sentence graph, nodes could be sentences and edges could represent semantic or syntactic relationships.

2. **Node Feature Initialization**: Each node in the graph is initialized with feature vectors that capture the properties of the text units. These features could be derived from word embeddings, sentence embeddings, or other textual representations.

3. **Spatial Convolution**: Spatial convolution in GNNs involves aggregating information from a node's neighbors to update its feature representation. This is done through a series of message-passing steps:
   - **Message Passing**: Each node collects feature information from its neighboring nodes.
   - **Aggregation**: The collected information is aggregated (e.g., by summing, averaging, or using a more complex function).
   - **Update**: The node's feature vector is updated based on the aggregated information and possibly its own features.

4. **Layer Stacking**: Multiple layers of spatial convolution can be stacked to allow information to propagate further across the graph. This enables nodes to gather contextual information from a wider neighborhood.

5. **Readout**: After several layers of convolution, a readout function is applied to extract a summary representation from the graph. This could involve pooling operations or attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant nodes.

6. **Summarization**: The final graph representation is used to generate the text summary. This could be done through various methods, such as decoding the graph representation into a summary text using a sequence-to-sequence model.

By leveraging the graph structure and spatial convolution, GNNs can effectively capture the relationships and dependencies within the text, leading to more coherent and contextually aware summaries.",How is message passing utilized in graph neural networks for text summarization?,How is message passing used in graph neural networks for text summarization?,"In graph neural networks (GNNs) for text summarization, message passing is a key mechanism where nodes within the graph exchange messages (perform convolutions) with their neighbors over several iterations. This iterative process allows information to propagate further across the graph with each iteration, similar to increasing the receptive field in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Formally, message passing at each time step \( t \) involves two main equations. The first equation describes how messages are generated using a differentiable function \( \phi \), which creates messages \( m \) for each edge based on the node features and edge features. The second equation updates each node's feature by first applying a permutation-invariant reduction function \( \rho \) to aggregate all incoming messages to a node, and then using another differentiable function \( \psi \) to combine the aggregated messages with the node's previous state.

The convolution layer in GNNs is defined with a learnable weight \( W \), where the message per edge is \( m_{t+1}^{i,j} = x_t^j \), and the aggregation is the normalized sum of messages. The reduction function, such as a sum function, must be permutation-invariant to handle the unordered nature of graphs.

However, this basic convolution layer does not filter unimportant neighbors. To address this, graph attention networks (GAT) introduce attention scores to each neighbor, inspired by the attention mechanism in transformer networks. This allows the model to assign importance to certain nodes and their messages. GAT uses multi-head attention, where the attention scores are computed and normalized to obtain the attention score per edge. A recent improvement, GATv2, enhances the expressive power of the layer by separating the learnable parameters, achieving better performance without increasing computational complexity.

In text summarization, GNNs often deal with heterogeneous graphs, requiring separate convolution layers for each node type combination. Pooling is also an important operation in GNNs, generating a global representation of the graph by pooling node features using functions like mean, max, or sum. GNN models for automatic text summarization (ATS) use common benchmark datasets, and the key requirement is to encode textual elements into feature vectors and connect them appropriately.","Questions:

The introduction of attention scores to the spatial convolution allows the model to explicitly assign importance to certain nodes and their messages.","sent1: One can view spatial convolution as used in GNNs as a generalization of the convolution used in neu-ral networks such as CNNs.
sent2: As an example, in the case of images, one can imagine 2D convolution as being applied to a regular grid of nodes where each node represents a pixel in the image.
sent3: The resulting 2D convolution applied to one target node is then the weighted average of node (pixel) values of the neighbours of the target node.
sent4: Generalizing this idea to a non-regular grids leads to spatial convolution.
sent5: However, different to images and regular grids, in graphs, the neighbours of each target node are unordered and can vary in number and their feature vector representation.
sent6: The major challenge with this extension consists therefore in dealing with the unordered and inconsistent neighbourhood sizes inherent to homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, with an additional challenge being posed by the differing feature vector representations in heterogeneous graphs.
sent7: Directly translating the above description of convolution into a mathematical formulation leads to a valid information propagation scheme.
sent8: However, such a description suffers from scalability issues due to it directly operating over the entire graph.
sent9: As such modern GNNs use, what is commonly referred to as, message passing.
sent10: In practice, this means that nodes within the graph exchange messages (perform convolutions) with their neighbours for a number of iterations.
sent11: Thereby the network is able to diffuse information throughout the graph.
sent12: Consequently, the more iterations, the further outwards information is propagated throughout the graph.
sent13: In the terminology of CNNs one would say that the more message passing iterations, the larger the receptive field of the convolution.
sent14: Formally, one can define message passing (Grattarola and Alippi, 2021) for each time step t as two equations:This first equation describes how messages are generated.
sent15: A differentiable function ϕ generates messages m for each edge which connects nodes using the node features and edge feature present.

sent21: The convolution layer for a GNN is then defined with a learnable weight W such that the message per edge is m t+1
sent22: i,j = x t j and the aggregation is the normalized sum of messages, i.e.where M (i) represents the set of messages received by node i, σ is the activation function, b is the bias, and c j,i is an appropriate scaling factor, e.g., the square root of the node degree.
sent23: Note how it is important for the reduction function, in this case a sum function, to be permutation-invariant as otherwise GNNs could not handle the unordered nature of graphs.

sent27: The introduction of attention scores to the spatial convolution allows the model to explicitly assign importance to certain nodes and their messages.
sent28: Just as in transformers GAT is formulated with multi-head attention.
sent29: The modification to the previously presented convolution layer follows closely the common attention formulation.
sent30: Formally, x t+1where α i,j is the attention score between node i and node j and K denotes the number of concatenated heads.
sent31: The attention scores are computed with.
sent32: This score is then normalized to obtain the attention score per edge α i,j = sof tmax i (r i,j ).
sent33: We want to highlight here a recent development which Brody et al. (2021) simply denote as GATv2.
sent34: Their main improvement aims at the fact that in the above calculation both learnable parameters a and W effectively fold into a single linear layer, thus the expressive power of the layer is less than what it could be.
sent35: The fix introduced by GATv2 pulls the two parameters apart, thus achieving more expressive power while not increasing computational complexity.
sent36: Taking the above description the attention score for GATv2 is modified as follows).
sent37: In both synthetic and real datasets this modification shows superior performance, which is supported by a theoretical analysis of the authors.
sent38: There are numerous modifications and extensions to the basic convolution presented here.
sent39: However, for ATS models, GAT layers are dominating as the workhorse for most models.
sent40: The reasoning for their dominance can be explained by the similar success that attention transformers have had in conventional neural networks for AST.
sent41: We expect that GATv2 will continue this trend as it is an attractive and simple improvement for the currently dominating GAT.
sent42: Although the authors of GATv2 note that it is not yet entirely clear which tasks would benefit the most from the usage of GATv2 over GAT, which will require more research and models to use GATv2.
sent43: In ATS the graphs used are in nearly all cases not homogeneous.
sent44: However, the equations presented here do not work for heterogeneous graphs.
sent45: The solution for this problem involves defining one convolution layer for each node type combination occurring within the graph.
sent46: In the case of the already discussed sentence and word node graph there would be four possible combinations of types, and four convolution layers which would have to be defined if the graph were fully connected.
sent47: Convolution is a central aspect of GNNs, but pooling also presents an important and common operation, especially whenever GNNs are used jointly with other models.
sent48: Pooling in GNNs is achieved by generating a global representation of the graph, or a subset of the graph, by pooling together features of nodes.
sent49: This is usually done with some function f where f is commonly the mean, max or sum.
sent50: We want to explicitly point out to the reader that the construction of GNNs does not require special datasets.
sent51: All GNN models for ATS use the common benchmark single-document and multidocument summarization datasets such as DUC 2004 or CNN/Dailymail.
sent52: The only requirement for any ATS, or textual dataset, is for the designer to find an appropriate way of encoding sentences, words, subwords etc. into feature vectors, and finding a sensible way of connecting them.","1. What is spatial convolution in the context of GNNs?

We will do so due to the fact that this model illustrates concepts and ideas seen throughout GNNs models used for ATS. An illustration of the general concepts presented here can be seen in Figure 3.', 'The HSG model encodes each text into a graph with three node types, sentence nodes, word nodes and document nodes. The connection between these nodes is decided by inclusion i.e. if the word represented by a word node occurs in a sentence then their respective nodes are connected by an edge. The same principle applies to document nodes which are connected depending on whether a word, represented by a word node, occurs within the document. This is a flexible structure, as it can be used in a single-document but also multidocument setting.  Figure 3: General architecture of standalone GNNs with word nodes and sentence nodes, encoders for both node types and a sentence selection mechanism. Inspired by HSG.', 'The feature vectors for all nodes are obtained by encoders and the edge weights are obtained by computing the TF-IDF score for each word.

What are the key features and performance outcomes of the HeterSumGraph (HSG) model in text summarization?

Answer:

The HSG model encodes each text into a graph with three node types: sentence nodes, word nodes, and document nodes.

The results for this model are quite impressive as it outperforms non-BERT based models on both single-document and multi-document summarization for the CNN/DailyMail dataset.

The flexibility and ability to use this model for both single-document and multi-document summarization are particularly noteworthy.","The HeterSumGraph (HSG) model in text summarization is designed to effectively capture and utilize the relationships between different elements within a document to generate high-quality summaries. Here are the key features and performance outcomes of the HSG model:

### Key Features:
1. **Heterogeneous Graph Construction**: HSG constructs a heterogeneous graph that includes different types of nodes such as sentences, entities, and topics. This allows the model to capture various relationships and interactions within the text.

2. **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**: The model employs GCNs to propagate information across the graph. This helps in effectively integrating the contextual information from different types of nodes and their connections.

3. **Attention Mechanism**: HSG uses an attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different nodes and edges in the graph. This ensures that the most relevant information is prioritized during the summarization process.

4. **Multi-Task Learning**: The model is trained using a multi-task learning approach, which helps in improving the performance by jointly learning to predict sentence importance and generate summaries.

### Performance Outcomes:
1. **Improved ROUGE Scores**: HSG has been shown to achieve higher ROUGE scores compared to several baseline models. ROUGE scores are a set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of summaries by comparing them to reference summaries.

2. **Better Content Selection**: The model demonstrates superior ability in selecting the most relevant and informative sentences from the document, leading to more coherent and comprehensive summaries.

3. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: By leveraging the heterogeneous graph structure, HSG can better understand the context and relationships within the text, resulting in summaries that are more contextually accurate and meaningful.

4. **Scalability**: The use of GCNs allows HSG to efficiently handle large documents and complex relationships, making it scalable to various text summarization tasks.

Overall, the HeterSumGraph model represents a significant advancement in the field of text summarization by effectively utilizing graph-based representations and neural network techniques to produce high-quality summaries.","What are the key components and notable results of the HeterSumGraph (HSG) model in text summarization, particularly in terms of node types and performance on the CNN/DailyMail dataset?","What are the key features and performance outcomes of the HeterSumGraph (HSG) model in text summarization, specifically regarding its node types and dataset performance?","The HeterSumGraph (HSG) model encodes each text into a graph with three node types: sentence nodes, word nodes, and document nodes.

The classification is done by a single linear layer, and trigram blocking is used during sentence selection to ensure summary sparsity. The HSG model outperforms non-BERT based models on both single-document and multi-document summarization for the CNN/DailyMail dataset, demonstrating its flexibility and effectiveness.","Questions:

What are the key features and performance outcomes of the HeterSumGraph (HSG) model in text summarization, specifically regarding its node types and dataset performance?

Answer:

The HeterSumGraph (HSG) model encodes each text into a graph with three node types: sentence nodes, word nodes, and document nodes. The connections between these nodes are based on word inclusion, making the structure flexible for both single-document and multi-document settings. Feature vectors for all nodes are obtained by encoders, and edge weights are computed using the TF-IDF score for each word. The model employs a modified GAT layer that considers the TF-IDF value of the connecting edge, and a positionwise feed-forward (FFN) layer is applied after the convolution.

The results for this model are quite impressive as it outperforms non-BERT based models on both single-document and multi-document summarization for the CNN/DailyMail dataset.

The flexibility and ability to use this model for both single-document and multi-document summarization are particularly noteworthy.","sent1: We will start our discussion of standalone GNN models with HeterSumGraph (HSG), a model proposed by .
sent2: We will do so due to the fact that this model illustrates concepts and ideas seen throughout GNNs models used for ATS.
sent3: An illustration of the general concepts presented here can be seen in Figure 3.
sent4: The HSG model encodes each text into a graph with three node types, sentence nodes, word nodes and document nodes.
sent5: The connection between these nodes is decided by inclusion i.e. if the word represented by a word node occurs in a sentence then their respective nodes are connected by an edge.
sent6: The same principle applies to document nodes which are connected depending on whether a word, represented by a word node, occurs within the document.
sent7: This is a flexible structure, as it can be used in a single-document but also multidocument setting.
sent8: Figure 3: General architecture of standalone GNNs with word nodes and sentence nodes, encoders for both node types and a sentence selection mechanism.
sent9: Inspired by HSG. The feature vectors for all nodes are obtained by encoders and the edge weights are obtained by computing the TF-IDF score for each word.
sent10: The neural network consists of a modified GAT layer.
sent11: The GAT is modified to consider the TF-IDF value of the connecting edge.
sent12: Additionally a positionwise feed-forward (FFN) layer consisting of two linear transformations is applied to the hidden state after the convolution.
sent13: In total three convolution layers are used, word-sentence, sentence-word and word-document.
sent14: The model is then trained on a node-based binary classification task that is predicting whether a sentence node is to be included for the summary or not.
sent15: The classification itself is done by a single linear layer.
sent16: The model then does not directly use the predicted nodes to produce the summary.
sent17: Instead trigram blocking (Paulus et al., 2018) is used during sentence selection in order to ensure sparsity of the generated summary.
sent18: The results for this model are quite impressive as it outperforms non-BERT based models on both single-document and multi-document summarization for the CNN/DailyMail dataset.
sent19: One should especially note the flexibility and ability to use this model for two tasks.
sent20: An older model by Muratore et al. (2010) can be considered a precursor to this architecture.
sent21: A simple extension to the HSG model is proposed by Ya et al. (2021).
sent22: In their extension they modify the model for query constraints for the summary.
sent23: This is achieved by adding a query node to the graph structure.
sent24: Additionally, they introduce a mu-tual information maximization mechanism during training.
sent25: A model which further follows this structure is the one by Linmei et al. (2019).
sent26: The authors there extend the attention mechanism by adding another layer of attention, allowing it to include information about the type of the node during convolution.
sent27: The GNN model by Jing et al. (2021) encodes even more information into the graph by considering the relation between sentences on a number of different levels.
sent28: In particular, they encode the semantic and syntactical relationship between sentences within the graph.
sent29: This idea of encoding additional information into the graph is also followed by Antognini and Faltings (2019).
sent30: They introduce an additional universal feature vector which is added to each sentence node embedding.
sent31: This universal feature vector is learned from a large unrelated and general corpus.
sent32: This model is also unique in that it focuses on the summarization of very small texts, on average less than 100 words.
sent33: Taking this basic structure and idea even further is the model called HAHSum by Jia et al. (2020a).
sent34: The construction of the input graph for HAHSum is more involved as it aims to significantly reduce semantic sparsity by utilizing named entities.
sent35: The model uses three types of nodes, named entity nodes, word nodes and sentence nodes, with the named entity nodes being anonymized tokens.
sent36: The graph is then built as follows, word nodes are connected with a directed edge to a sentence node if they occur within the sentence.
sent37: Two named entities are connected with an undirected edge if they represent the same entity and two sentence nodes are connected with an undirected edge if they share a trigram.
sent38: Additionally, sequentially occurring words and entities are connected with a directed edge.
sent39: This setup shows how one can encode a substantial amount of implicit information in an explicit manner.
sent40: HAHSum uses a GAT for each of the five node type combinations found within the graph.
sent41: Just as in HSG, a FFN is applied after the multi-head attention and again as in the previous model a linear layer is used to perform the binary classification of the sentence nodes.
sent42: The results for HAHSum show that GNNs can perform very well.
sent43: The authors of the paper tested the model on the CNN/Daily Mail, Newsroom and NYT dataset.
sent44: The model outperforms very pow- erful models such as MATCHSUM (Zhong et al., 2020) and is even able to compete in some metrics with leading abstractive models such as PEGASUS .
sent45: The results of an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment corroborate these results and show that for human readers HAHSum produce summaries with superior fluency and conciseness.
sent46: Another recent GNN model which has achieved great performance in the task of multi-document summarization is the SgSum model by .
sent47: Different to the approaches outlined above, the SgSum model uses graph pooling to extract sub-graphs from encoded documents.
sent48: That is, it first transforms the documents into a large graph, then generates a number of sub-graphs via pooling and convolution.
sent49: These sub-graphs are then ranked and thereby selected for a summary.
sent50: This is quite an innovative approach as it casts the problem of multi-document summarization as a simple subgraph selection problem.
sent51: Additionally, it outputs an integral summary, that is the entire summary is output by the model in the form of the sub-graph of sentences.","1. (What is the focus of the discussion on standalone GNN models?): sent1

Here are some common strategies used:

1. **Uncertainty Sampling**: This strategy selects data points for which the model is least certain about the predictions. Common methods include:
   - **Least Confidence**: Selecting instances where the model's predicted probability for the most likely class is lowest.
   - **Margin Sampling**: Choosing instances where the difference between the top two predicted probabilities is smallest.
   - **Entropy-Based Sampling**: Selecting instances with the highest entropy in the predicted class probabilities, indicating maximum uncertainty.

2. **Query-by-Committee (QBC)**: This approach involves maintaining a committee of models and selecting instances where the committee members disagree the most. The disagreement can be measured using:
   - **Vote Entropy**: Measuring the entropy of the votes from different models.
   - **Kullback-Leibler Divergence**: Measuring the divergence between the probability distributions predicted by different models.

3. **Expected Model Change**: This strategy selects instances that would result in the greatest change to the current model if they were labeled and added to the training set. It aims to maximize the learning impact of each new data point.

4. **Expected Error Reduction**: This method selects instances that are expected to reduce the model's future error the most. It involves estimating the potential decrease in error if a particular instance were labeled and added to the training set.

5. **Diversity Sampling**: This strategy focuses on selecting a diverse set of instances to ensure that the model is exposed to a wide variety of data points. Techniques include:
   - **Clustering**: Selecting instances from different clusters in the feature space.
   - **Core-Set Selection**: Choosing instances that best represent the entire dataset.

6. **Representativeness-Based Sampling**: This approach selects instances that are most representative of the underlying data distribution. It ensures that the selected instances are not outliers and are indicative of the general data trends.

7. **Hybrid Methods**: Combining multiple strategies to leverage their strengths. For example, combining uncertainty sampling with diversity sampling to select uncertain yet diverse instances.

These strategies help in efficiently utilizing labeled data, reducing the labeling cost, and improving the model's performance by focusing on the most informative data points.","What strategies are used to predict performance for active learning in NLP, particularly those involving model-based selection and error reduction techniques?","What strategies are used to predict performance for active learning in NLP, including recent advancements and specific techniques for tasks like machine translation?","The expected error reduction strategy (Roy and McCallum, 2001) selects instances that are predicted to lead to the least expected error if added to retrain a model, though this can be computationally expensive due to the need for retraining.

What are some common strategies for uncertainty sampling in active learning for NLP?

Answer:

None","Uncertainty sampling is a popular strategy in active learning, particularly for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The main idea is to select the most informative samples for labeling, which are typically those that the current model is most uncertain about. Here are some common strategies for uncertainty sampling in NLP:

1. **Least Confidence Sampling**: This strategy selects the samples for which the model has the lowest confidence in its most likely prediction. For example, if a model predicts a class with 60% confidence, this sample would be considered more uncertain than one predicted with 90% confidence.

2. **Margin Sampling**: This approach selects samples based on the difference between the top two predicted probabilities. The smaller the margin, the more uncertain the model is about the prediction. For instance, if the top two classes have probabilities of 45% and 40%, the margin is 5%, indicating high uncertainty.

3. **Entropy-Based Sampling**: Entropy measures the amount of uncertainty in the model's predictions. Samples with higher entropy are considered more uncertain. The entropy \( H \) for a probability distribution \( P \) over classes can be calculated as:
   \[
   H(P) = - \sum_{i} P_i \log P_i
   \]
   where \( P_i \) is the probability of the \( i \)-th class.

4. **Query-by-Committee (QBC)**: This method involves maintaining a committee of models and selecting samples on which the committee members disagree the most. The disagreement can be measured in various ways, such as vote entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence.

5. **Expected Model Change**: This strategy selects samples that are expected to cause the most significant change in the model parameters if they were labeled and added to the training set. This requires estimating the impact of each potential sample on the model.

6. **Expected Error Reduction**: This method selects samples that are expected to reduce the model's future error the most. It involves estimating the reduction in error that would result from labeling each candidate sample.

7. **Variance Reduction**: This approach selects samples that are expected to reduce the output variance of the model the most. It aims to make the model's predictions more stable and reliable.

These strategies can be applied to various NLP tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and machine translation, to improve model performance with fewer labeled examples.","What are some common strategies for uncertainty sampling in active learning, specifically for natural language processing tasks?",What are some common strategies for uncertainty sampling in active learning for NLP tasks?,,"Questions:

Downstream Tasks##
Using neural representations for tabular data show, improvements in performance in several downstream tasks. In this section, we describe the tasks and define their input and output. While they all consume tables, settings can be quite heterogeneous, with systems exploiting different information, even for the same task. A summary of the covered tasks along their input, output, and some representative systems addressing them is shown in Table 4. We detail next the mandatory input elements and the different contexts.  (Dagan et al., 2013;Korman et al., 2018), checking facts with tables consists of verifying if a textual input claim is true or false against a trusted database (TAPEX, DECO, TABFACT), also provided as input. Some fact-checking systems, such as FEVEROUS, also output the cells used for verification as evidence (Nakov et al., 2021;Karagiannis et al., 2020).

Question Answering (QA): In the free text setting, QA aims at retrieving passages that include the answer to a given question. In the tabular data setting, it consists of returning as output the cells that answer an input consisting of a question and a table. One can distinguish two levels of complexity. Simple QA involves lookup queries on tables (DTR, CLTR), while a more complex QA  Most of the systems in this survey aim at improving accuracy in QA with respect to hand-crafted embeddings.

Semantic Parsing (SP): In the tabular data setting, given a question and a table as input, SP generates a declarative query in SQL over the table's schema to retrieve the answer to the question. While in QA the interest is in directly getting the answer, SP produces the (interpretable) query to obtain it (TABERT, GRAPPA, TAPEX).  table that can be used to answer the question. TR is helpful when trying to reduce the search space for a QA task (GTR, DTR, MMR). It is a challenging task given the limited input size of transformers, that is, their constraint to sequences of 512 tokens.  We observe that most tasks can be seen as traditional NLP problems where structured data replace free text, such as the case of QA where answers are located in tabular data instead of documents (Gupta and Gupta, 2012). TFC involves retrieving cells that entail or refute a given statement, whereas on free text the corresponding objective is to select sentences as evidence (Thorne et al., 2018). SP is the task of converting natural language utterance into a logical form (Berant and Liang, 2014), which in this setting is expressed as a declarative query over a relational table. TR on tabular data corresponds to passage retrieval on free text (Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997). TCP is analogous to predicting missing words or values in a sentence . Finally, TMP can be related to syntactic parsing in NLP (Van Gompel and Pickering, 2007), where relationships between different tokens are depicted.

We conclude this section with an analysis of the performance of the systems over the different downstream tasks. For every task, we selected datasets for which at least two systems have reported results. All datasets reported in Table 5 (Ghasemi-Gol and Szekely, 2018), which contains web tables annotated with their type (relational, entity, matrix, list, and non-data), and EntiTab (Zhang and Balog, 2017), which contains web tables annotated with possible header labels for the column population task. Table 5 also contains the size, expressed as number of parameters, of the largest model used by every system. As some systems are not comparable on any shared datasets, we report here their size: TABFACT (110M), MMR (87M), TURL (314M), RPT (139M), and CLTR (235M). Larger models do not correlate with better performance across different systems for the same task, but a larger model always brings higher scores for the same system, as expected. Execution times for training and testing depend on the size of the model and the computing architecture.

The results in the table show that some tasks, such as TFC and TMP, can already be handled successfully by the systems, while some tasks, such as TCP, TR, and SP, are harder.

What are the main components and variations of the vanilla transformer architecture?

Answer:

The vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a seq2seq model (Sutskever et al., 2014) consisting of an encoder and a decoder, each of which is a stack of N identical modules.

The encoder block is composed of a multi-head self-attention module and a position-wise feed-forward network.

Here are the main components and some common variations:

### Main Components of the Vanilla Transformer Architecture:

1. **Input Embedding and Positional Encoding:**
   - **Input Embedding:** Converts input tokens into dense vectors.
   - **Positional Encoding:** Adds information about the position of each token in the sequence to the input embeddings, since the transformer does not inherently capture sequence order.

2. **Encoder:**
   - **Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism:** Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
   - **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN):** Applies a fully connected feed-forward network to each position separately and identically.
   - **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections:** Applied after each sub-layer (self-attention and FFN) to stabilize and improve training.

3. **Decoder:**
   - **Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism:** Similar to the encoder's self-attention but prevents attending to future tokens in the sequence.
   - **Encoder-Decoder Attention:** Allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.
   - **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN):** Similar to the encoder's FFN.
   - **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections:** Applied similarly as in the encoder.

4. **Output Layer:**
   - **Linear Layer and Softmax:** Converts the decoder's output into probabilities over the target vocabulary.

### Variations of the Transformer Architecture:

1. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**
   - Uses only the encoder part of the transformer.
   - Pre-trained on large text corpora using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks.

2. **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):**
   - Uses only the decoder part of the transformer.
   - Pre-trained on large text corpora using a unidirectional (left-to-right) language modeling task.

3. **Transformer-XL:**
   - Introduces recurrence to handle longer sequences by maintaining a memory of past segments.

4. **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer):**
   - Treats all NLP tasks as text-to-text problems.
   - Uses both encoder and decoder, similar to the vanilla transformer, but with task-specific prefixes.

5. **RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach):**
   - An optimized version of BERT with changes in pre-training, such as removing the next sentence prediction task and training on larger batches and longer sequences.

6. **ALBERT (A Lite BERT):**
   - Reduces the number of parameters by sharing weights across layers and factorizing the embedding parameters.

7. **DistilBERT:**
   - A smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT, achieved through knowledge distillation.

These variations often involve modifications to the training objectives, architecture, or both, to improve performance on specific tasks or to make the models more efficient.","What are the main components of the vanilla transformer architecture, and how can it be adapted into different model types?",What are the main components of the vanilla transformer architecture and how can it be used in different model configurations?,"The vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a seq2seq model (Sutskever et al., 2014) consisting of an encoder and a decoder, each of which is a stack of N identical modules.

Answer:

The datasets consist of tables and their context, such as table metadata, surrounding texts, claims, or questions.

For instance, Wikipedia tables contain a large number of relational tables (Bhagavatula et al., 2015), while WDC and Spreadsheets also include entity tables and spreadsheets with complex structures.","When working with transformers on tabular data, the characteristics of datasets used for pre-training and fine-tuning can vary significantly based on the specific goals and requirements of the task. Here are the key characteristics for both pre-training and fine-tuning datasets:

### Pre-training Datasets:
1. **Large and Diverse**: Pre-training datasets are typically large and diverse to help the model learn a wide range of patterns and relationships. This diversity can include various types of tabular data from different domains.
2. **Rich in Features**: These datasets often contain a rich set of features, including numerical, categorical, and sometimes even textual data, to help the model learn complex interactions.
3. **Publicly Available**: Many pre-training datasets are publicly available and well-documented, such as those from open data repositories or industry benchmarks.
4. **High-Quality Data**: The data should be clean and well-structured to ensure that the model learns meaningful patterns rather than noise.
5. **Balanced**: Ideally, the dataset should be balanced to prevent the model from becoming biased towards certain classes or outcomes.

### Fine-tuning Datasets:
1. **Task-Specific**: Fine-tuning datasets are specific to the task at hand, such as classification, regression, or anomaly detection. They are tailored to the particular problem the model needs to solve.
2. **Smaller in Size**: These datasets are usually smaller than pre-training datasets but should still be sufficiently large to fine-tune the model effectively.
3. **Relevant Features**: The features in the fine-tuning dataset should be highly relevant to the task. Irrelevant features can be removed to improve model performance.
4. **Labeled Data**: Fine-tuning requires labeled data, especially for supervised learning tasks. The quality and accuracy of these labels are crucial for effective fine-tuning.
5. **Domain-Specific**: The data should come from the same domain as the application to ensure that the model generalizes well to real-world scenarios.
6. **Balanced and Representative**: The dataset should be balanced and representative of the real-world distribution to avoid biases and ensure robust performance.

### Common Practices:
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as data augmentation can be used to artificially increase the size of the fine-tuning dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Both pre-training and fine-tuning may involve feature engineering to create new features that can help the model learn better.
- **Normalization and Encoding**: Numerical features are often normalized, and categorical features are encoded (e.g., one-hot encoding) to make them suitable for model training.

By carefully selecting and preparing datasets for both pre-training and fine-tuning, you can significantly enhance the performance and generalization capabilities of transformers on tabular data.","What are the characteristics of datasets used for pre-training and fine-tuning transformers on tabular data, particularly in terms of annotation and structure?","What are the characteristics of datasets used for pre-training and fine-tuning transformers on tabular data, particularly in terms of annotation and structure?","Pre-training tables are not annotated and are sometimes scraped from the web, whereas data used for fine-tuning have task-dependent annotation labels. The datasets consist of tables and their context, such as table metadata, surrounding texts, claims, or questions. To construct large pre-training datasets and reduce bias, multiple sources can be used, independent of the target task. For example, Wikipedia tables contain a large number of relational tables (Bhagavatula et al., 2015), while WDC and Spreadsheets include entity tables and spreadsheets with complex structures. The top four datasets are mostly used for pre-training, while others can be used for fine-tuning as they include annotations for the target task.

sent2: Pre-training tables are not annotated, in some cases scraped from the web, while data used for fine-tuning have task-dependent annotation labels.
sent3: The datasets consist of tables and their context, such as table metadata, surrounding texts, claims or questions.
sent4: To construct large pre-training datasets and in an attempt to reduce bias, multiple sources can be used, independently of the target task at hand.
sent5: For instance, unlike TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020), which only uses Wikipedia Tables for QA, and TABULARNET , which only uses Spreadsheets for TMP, TABERT  uses Wikipedia Tables and WDC  for SP; GRAPPA uses Wikipedia Tables, Spider, and WikiSQL for SP; MMR (Kostić et al., 2021) uses NQ, OTT-QA, and WikiSQL for TR; MATE  uses Wikipedia Tables and HybridQA for QA; and TUTA  uses Wikipedia Tables, WDC, and spreadsheets for TMP.

sent10: We note that the top four datasets are mostly used for pre-training, while the others can be used for fine-tuning as well since they include annotations for the target task, for example, questions/answers for QA.
sent11: The column ''Large Tables'' is a binary indicator, where ✔ and ✘ indicate whether or not the tabular corpus include large tables and hence whether or not some pre-processing is needed to reduce table content to meet the limits of the transformer architecture (512 input tokens in most cases).
sent12: Some works, such as TABERT, TAPEX (Liu et al., 2021a), and CLTR (Pan et al., 2021), apply filtering in any case to reduce noisy input.

Answer:

Throughout the survey process, inadequate dataset documentation was identified as a limitation, which restricted the coverage of the survey.

Another limitation identified is the very low presence of indigenous language datasets.

Furthermore, poorly written documentation or unavailable datasets were frequently encountered during the annotation processes.","The limitations identified in the survey of multilingual dataset construction include:

1. **Language Coverage**: Many datasets are limited in the number of languages they cover, often focusing on a few high-resource languages while neglecting low-resource languages.
2. **Quality and Consistency**: Ensuring high quality and consistency across multiple languages can be challenging, leading to potential biases and inaccuracies.
3. **Cultural and Linguistic Diversity**: Datasets may not adequately capture the cultural and linguistic diversity of the languages included, which can affect the performance of models trained on these datasets.
4. **Resource Availability**: There is often a lack of resources, such as native speakers or linguistic experts, to assist in the creation and validation of multilingual datasets.
5. **Standardization**: There is a lack of standardized methodologies and best practices for constructing multilingual datasets, which can lead to inconsistencies and difficulties in comparing different datasets.
6. **Scalability**: Scaling the construction of multilingual datasets to include more languages and larger volumes of data can be resource-intensive and technically challenging.
7. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the quality and effectiveness of multilingual datasets can be difficult, especially when dealing with low-resource languages where benchmarks and evaluation tools may be lacking.

These limitations highlight the complexities and challenges involved in creating comprehensive and reliable multilingual datasets for natural language processing tasks.",What specific limitations were identified in the survey process of multilingual dataset documentation and coverage?,What specific limitations were identified in the survey process of multilingual dataset construction?,"### Refined Question-Answer Pair
**Question:**
What specific limitations were identified in the survey process of multilingual dataset construction?

**Answer:**
Several limitations were identified in the survey process of multilingual dataset construction:

1. **Inadequate Dataset Documentation:** The survey found that many datasets had insufficient documentation, which limited the coverage and depth of the survey. The lack of detailed information about input data sources, labeling methodologies, and demographic information of people involved in dataset creation hindered the analysis of potential biases.

2. **Incomplete Dataset Coverage:** Despite extensive efforts, the survey does not claim to cover all relevant datasets. The collection process missed datasets published at non-ACL venues, those not available on Hugging Face, and papers that did not match the search keywords. For example, multilingual machine reading comprehension datasets and morphology datasets were overlooked.

3. **Low Presence of Indigenous Language Datasets:** The survey found a very low presence of datasets for indigenous languages. None of the 10 indigenous American languages from a recent study were represented in the survey.

4. **Poor Documentation and Unavailable Datasets:** During the annotation process, the survey frequently encountered poorly written documentation or datasets that were unavailable. Annotators had to make their best guesses to categorize these datasets, and unclear decisions were adjudicated by at least three annotators.

5. **Using Country Names as a Proxy for Languages Spoken:** The survey used the names of ACL submission countries to approximate the number of NLP researchers with language proficiency in different languages. This approach has limitations, such as the country of origin of researchers being different from the country of submission, researchers' native languages not being listed among the commonly spoken languages, and the mapping being potentially incomprehensive.

6. **MTurk Pilot Study Limitations:** The MTurk study had limited data points, and while it suggested that data quality could be improved with language qualifications, more research at scale is needed to statistically confirm this conclusion. Additionally, many languages other than the supported five might still be unsuitable for gathering multilingual data on MTurk.","Questions:

3. **Open Data Initiatives**: Promote open data initiatives where existing datasets are shared freely with the community. This can include creating repositories where multilingual datasets are stored and made accessible to researchers and developers.

4. **Funding and Grants**: Secure funding and grants specifically aimed at the creation and maintenance of multilingual datasets. Governments, NGOs, and private sector companies can play a crucial role in providing financial support.

5. **Standardization**: Develop and adopt standards for dataset creation, annotation, and evaluation to ensure consistency and quality across different languages and datasets.

6. **Language Resource Centers**: Establish language resource centers dedicated to the collection, annotation, and distribution of multilingual datasets. These centers can serve as hubs for linguistic data and expertise.

7. **Community Engagement**: Engage with local communities and linguistic experts to ensure that the datasets are representative and culturally relevant. This can also help in identifying and including underrepresented languages.

8. **Technological Tools**: Develop and share tools and frameworks that facilitate the creation and annotation of multilingual datasets. This can include software for automatic translation, transcription, and annotation.

9. **Educational Programs**: Create educational programs and training workshops to build expertise in multilingual data collection and annotation among researchers and practitioners.

What are the main linguistic constraints used in code-switching models?

Answer:

The Equivalence Constraint states that in a well-formed code-switched sentence, the switching takes place at those points where the grammatical constraints of both languages are satisfied (Poplack, 1980).

The Matrix-Embedded Language Framework (MLF) proposed by Myers-Scotton (1997) suggests that in bilingual code-switching, there exists an asymmetrical relationship between the dominant matrix language and the subordinate embedded language.

The Functional Head Constraint posits that it is impossible to switch languages between a functional head and its complement because of the strong relationship between the two constituents (Belazi et al., 1994).","The main linguistic constraints used in code-switching models typically include:

1. **Equivalence Constraint**: This constraint suggests that code-switching tends to occur at points in the sentence where the surface structures of the two languages align. In other words, switches are more likely to happen at points where the grammatical rules of both languages are compatible.

2. **Free Morpheme Constraint**: According to this constraint, code-switching cannot occur between a bound morpheme (like a prefix or suffix) and a free morpheme (a standalone word). For example, you wouldn't typically see a switch within a word where a prefix from one language is attached to a root from another language.

3. **Matrix Language Frame Model**: This model posits that in code-switching, one language (the matrix language) provides the grammatical structure into which elements from the other language (the embedded language) are inserted. The matrix language dictates the overall sentence structure and grammatical rules.

4. **Functional Head Constraint**: This constraint suggests that code-switching is less likely to occur between a functional head (like a determiner, complementizer, or auxiliary verb) and its complement. Functional heads are elements that play a key role in the syntactic structure of a sentence.

These constraints help linguists understand and predict the patterns and limits of code-switching in bilingual speech.","What are the main linguistic constraints identified in code-switching models, and who proposed them?","What are the main linguistic constraints identified in code-switching models according to Poplack, Myers-Scotton, and Belazi et al.?","The Equivalence Constraint, as identified by Poplack (1980), states that in a well-formed code-switched sentence, the switching occurs at points where the grammatical constraints of both languages are satisfied.

Another approach is to train bilingual embeddings using real and synthetic CSW data (Pratapa et al., 2018b).","In code-switching research, pre-trained embeddings are commonly utilized through several methods to enhance the performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Here are some of the common methods:

1. **Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models**: Pre-trained language models like BERT, GPT, or multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R can be fine-tuned on code-switched data. This involves further training the model on a code-switched corpus to adapt the embeddings to the specific characteristics of code-switched language.

2. **Static Word Embeddings**: Pre-trained static word embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText can be used. These embeddings are typically trained on large monolingual corpora and can be combined or adapted for code-switching scenarios. For instance, embeddings from different languages can be aligned or merged to handle code-switched text.

3. **Contextual Embeddings**: Utilizing contextual embeddings from models like BERT, ELMo, or their multilingual variants. These models generate embeddings based on the context of the word in a sentence, which can be particularly useful for handling the dynamic nature of code-switching.

4. **Cross-Lingual Embeddings**: Leveraging cross-lingual embeddings that are trained to map words from different languages into a shared vector space. This can help in understanding and processing code-switched text by providing a unified representation for words from different languages.

5. **Transfer Learning**: Applying transfer learning techniques where a model pre-trained on a large corpus in one or multiple languages is adapted to code-switched data. This can involve additional training on a smaller code-switched dataset to fine-tune the embeddings.

6. **Data Augmentation**: Using data augmentation techniques to create synthetic code-switched data from monolingual corpora. This augmented data can then be used to train or fine-tune pre-trained embeddings to better handle code-switching.

7. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining multiple methods, such as using both static and contextual embeddings, or integrating cross-lingual embeddings with fine-tuning, to capture the nuances of code-switched language more effectively.

These methods help in leveraging the strengths of pre-trained embeddings while adapting them to the unique challenges posed by code-switching in NLP tasks.",What are the common methods for utilizing pre-trained embeddings in neural-based approaches for code-switching research?,What are the common methods for utilizing pre-trained embeddings in neural-based approaches for code-switching research?,"Pre-trained embeddings are used to complement neural-based approaches by initializing the embedding layer.

sent14: In the speech domain, Lovenia et al. (2022) utilize wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020) as a starting model before fine-tuning.
sent15: Language Models Many pre-trained model approaches utilize multilingual LMs, such as mBERT or XLM-R to deal with CSW data (Khanuja et al., 2020b;Aguilar and Solorio, 2020;Pant and Dadu, 2020;Patwa et al., 2020;Winata et al., 2021a).
sent16: These models are often fine-tuned with the downstream task or with CSW text to better adapt to the languages.
sent17: Some downstream fine-tuning approaches use synthetic CSW data due to a lack of available datasets.
sent18: Aguilar et al. (2021) propose a character-based subword module (char2subword) of the mBERT that learns the subword embedding that is suitable for modeling the noisy CSW text.
sent19: Winata et al. (2021a) compare the performance of the multilingual LM versus the language-specific LM for CSW context.
sent20: While XLM-R provides the best result, it is also computationally heavy.
sent21: There needed to be more exploration of larger models.
sent22: We see that pre-trained LMs provide better empirical results on current benchmark tasks and enables an end-to-end approach.
sent23: Therefore, one can theoretically work on CSW tasks without any linguistic understanding of the language, assuming the dataset for model finetuning is available.

What are the main strategies used in negotiation according to research?

Answer:

None","Research identifies several main strategies used in negotiation, including:

1. **Distributive Negotiation (or Competitive/Win-Lose Negotiation)**: This strategy focuses on dividing a fixed amount of resources, where one party's gain is the other party's loss. It often involves hard bargaining and competitive tactics.

2. **Integrative Negotiation (or Collaborative/Win-Win Negotiation)**: This approach aims to find mutually beneficial solutions by addressing the interests and needs of all parties involved. It encourages cooperation, problem-solving, and creative thinking to expand the pie rather than just dividing it.

3. **Mixed-Motive Negotiation**: This strategy combines elements of both distributive and integrative negotiation. Negotiators recognize that some issues may be zero-sum, while others can be approached collaboratively to create value.

4. **Principled Negotiation (or Interest-Based Negotiation)**: Developed by the Harvard Negotiation Project, this method focuses on separating people from the problem, focusing on interests rather than positions, generating options for mutual gain, and using objective criteria to make decisions.

5. **BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)**: This strategy involves understanding and developing one's best alternative if the current negotiations fail. Knowing your BATNA provides leverage and helps negotiators make informed decisions.

6. **Anchoring**: This tactic involves setting a reference point (anchor) around which negotiations will revolve. The initial offer can significantly influence the negotiation's outcome.

7. **Concession Making**: This involves strategically making concessions to move the negotiation forward while aiming to receive concessions in return.

8. **Framing**: This strategy involves presenting information and proposals in a way that influences the other party's perception and decision-making.

These strategies can be used individually or in combination, depending on the context and goals of the negotiation.",What are the primary strategies identified by research that are used in negotiation?,What are the primary strategies identified by research for effective negotiation?,,"Questions:

Recently, Dutt et al. (2021b) propose a generalized framework for identifying resisting strategies in persuasive negotiations using a pre-trained BERT model (Devlin et al., 2019).","To improve negotiation dialogue systems beyond supervised learning, several advanced methods can be employed:

1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** This involves training the system to make decisions by rewarding successful negotiation outcomes and penalizing failures. The system learns optimal strategies through trial and error.

2. **Self-Play:** The system can engage in negotiations with itself to explore a wide range of strategies and outcomes. This helps in refining its negotiation tactics without requiring human intervention.

3. **Transfer Learning:** Leveraging pre-trained models on related tasks can provide a strong foundation for negotiation systems. Fine-tuning these models on negotiation-specific data can enhance their performance.

4. **Adversarial Training:** Introducing adversarial agents that challenge the negotiation system can help it learn to handle difficult scenarios and improve its robustness.

5. **Multi-Agent Systems:** Training multiple agents to negotiate with each other can create a more dynamic learning environment, allowing the system to adapt to various negotiation styles and strategies.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Incorporating human feedback during the training process can help the system learn more effectively by correcting mistakes and refining strategies based on human expertise.

7. **Curriculum Learning:** Gradually increasing the complexity of negotiation scenarios during training can help the system build its skills progressively, starting from simple tasks and moving to more complex ones.

8. **Data Augmentation:** Generating synthetic negotiation dialogues or augmenting existing data can provide more diverse training examples, helping the system generalize better to different negotiation contexts.

By integrating these methods, negotiation dialogue systems can achieve more sophisticated and effective negotiation capabilities beyond what is possible with supervised learning alone.",What are some advanced methods proposed in recent research to enhance negotiation dialogue systems beyond traditional supervised learning?,What are some advanced methods proposed in recent research to enhance negotiation dialogue systems beyond supervised learning?,"Supervised learning only aims to mimic the average human behavior, so He et al.

(2021) propose an integrated framework with deep Q-learning, which includes multiple channel negotiation skills.","Reinforcement learning has been applied to negotiation dialogue systems to enhance their ability to autonomously negotiate and reach agreements in various scenarios. By using reinforcement learning, these systems can learn optimal negotiation strategies through trial and error, receiving feedback from their interactions to improve their performance over time. This approach allows the systems to adapt to different negotiation styles and tactics, ultimately aiming to achieve favorable outcomes.

Key applications include:

1. **Automated Bargaining Agents**: Reinforcement learning is used to train agents that can negotiate prices, terms, and conditions in e-commerce and online marketplaces. These agents learn to maximize their utility while considering the preferences and constraints of the other party.

2. **Human-Agent Negotiations**: Systems are developed to negotiate with human users, providing a platform for training and improving human negotiation skills. These systems can adapt to human behavior and offer realistic negotiation experiences.

3. **Multi-Agent Negotiations**: In scenarios involving multiple agents, reinforcement learning helps in coordinating strategies among agents to reach a consensus or distribute resources efficiently.

4. **Complex Negotiation Scenarios**: Reinforcement learning enables systems to handle complex negotiations involving multiple issues, long-term interactions, and dynamic environments. This includes applications in diplomacy, conflict resolution, and business negotiations.

How have specific reinforcement learning techniques been applied to negotiation dialogue systems?

Answer:

English and Heeman (2005) were the first to use reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for negotiation dialogue systems, employing a single-agent pattern to learn the policy of two opponents individually.

Georgila et al. (2014) further advanced the framework by using multi-agent RL techniques, which simultaneously model two parties and provide a way to deal with multi-issue scenarios.

Keizer et al. (2017) propose to learn the action of the target agents with a Q-learning reward function.

For instance, Zhang et al. (2020) propose OPPA, which lets the target agent behave given the system actions.

Shi et al. (2021) use a modular framework containing a language model to generate responses, a response detector to automatically annotate the response with a negotiation strategy, and an RL-based reward function to assign a score to the strategy.

Instead of the modular framework which separates policy learning and response generation, Gao et al.

Answer:

The standard practice for deep learning techniques is to treat numbers in the same way as words.

Early neural network methods create a vocabulary that maps input words and numbers to token IDs, resulting in less frequent numbers being collapsed into an ""UNK"" token.

Recent studies have shown that these tokenization approaches are suboptimal (Wallace et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020d; Thawani et al., 2022).

The insufficient representations of numbers can lead to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.

Although increasing model scales could help, even the state-of-the-art large language model GPT-3 performs poorly when reasoning over large numbers.","Current deep learning models struggle with numeracy for several reasons:

1. **Training Data**: These models are typically trained on large text corpora that may not contain sufficient examples of numerical reasoning or arithmetic operations. As a result, they do not learn the underlying principles of numeracy effectively.

2. **Architecture Limitations**: Most deep learning models, such as transformers, are designed to handle sequential data and patterns in text rather than perform precise mathematical calculations. They excel at pattern recognition and language understanding but are not inherently equipped for arithmetic operations.

3. **Tokenization Issues**: Numbers can be tokenized in various ways, and the representation of numbers in the model's input can affect its ability to perform numerical tasks. For example, splitting a number into individual digits can make it harder for the model to understand it as a whole.

4. **Lack of Explicit Mathematical Rules**: Deep learning models do not have built-in knowledge of mathematical rules and operations. They rely on patterns in the data rather than explicit algorithms, which can lead to errors in numerical reasoning.

5. **Generalization Problems**: Even if a model learns to perform certain numerical tasks during training, it may struggle to generalize to new, unseen numerical problems, especially if they differ significantly from the training examples.

6. **Contextual Understanding**: Numerical reasoning often requires understanding the context in which numbers are used, which can be challenging for models that primarily focus on text patterns rather than the semantics of numbers.

To address these challenges, researchers are exploring various approaches, such as incorporating explicit mathematical reasoning modules, improving the representation of numbers, and using specialized datasets that focus on numerical tasks.",Why do current deep learning models struggle with effectively processing and reasoning with numbers?,Why do current deep learning models struggle with effectively processing and reasoning with numbers?,"The standard practice for deep learning techniques is to treat numbers in the same way as words.

Why do current deep learning models struggle with effectively processing and reasoning with numbers?

Answer:

The standard practice for deep learning techniques is to treat numbers in the same way as words. Early neural network methods create a vocabulary that maps input words and numbers to token IDs, resulting in less frequent numbers being collapsed into an ""UNK"" token. Recent language models use subword tokenization techniques to split numbers into atomic tokens. However, these tokenization approaches are suboptimal.

What are the challenges associated with selecting in-context examples for few-shot learning in mathematical reasoning?

Answer:

None","The challenges associated with selecting in-context examples for few-shot learning in mathematical reasoning include:

1. **Relevance and Diversity**: Ensuring that the selected examples are relevant to the task at hand while also covering a diverse range of problem types and difficulty levels. This helps the model generalize better to new problems.

2. **Complexity Matching**: Choosing examples that match the complexity of the target problem. If the examples are too simple or too complex compared to the target problem, the model may not perform optimally.

3. **Contextual Coherence**: Maintaining coherence in the examples so that the model can understand the context and apply similar reasoning steps. Incoherent examples can confuse the model and degrade performance.

4. **Balancing Specificity and Generality**: Striking a balance between examples that are specific enough to guide the model effectively but general enough to be applicable to a range of problems.

5. **Avoiding Overfitting**: Preventing the model from overfitting to the specific examples provided, which can limit its ability to generalize to new problems.

6. **Example Quality**: Ensuring high-quality examples that are correctly solved and well-explained, as errors or ambiguities in examples can mislead the model.

7. **Scalability**: Managing the scalability of selecting and curating examples, especially as the number of potential examples grows with more complex mathematical domains.

What are the specific challenges in selecting in-context examples for few-shot learning in mathematical reasoning tasks?

Answer:

nan",,"sent1: Early chain-of-thought work randomly or heuristically selects in-context examples.
sent2: However, recent studies have shown that this type of few-shot learning can be highly unstable across different selections of in-context examples (Rubin et al., 2022;Liu et al., 2022a).
sent3: Therefore, which incontext reasoning examples make the most effective prompts is still an unknown problem in the literature.
sent4: To address the limitation, recent work has investigated various methods to optimize the in-context examples selection process (Rubin et al., 2022;Zhang et al., 2023;Lu et al., 2022b;Yu et al., 2023;Fu et al., 2023).

sent6: In deductive reasoning, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.
sent7: For example:• Premise: All mammals have kidneys.
sent8: • Premise: All whales are mammals.
sent9: • Conclusion: All whales have kidneys.
sent10: Inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on observations or evidence.
sent11: The conclusion is likely to be true based on the available evidence, but it is not necessarily certain.
sent12: For example:• Observation: Every time we see a creature with wings, it is a bird.
sent13: • Observation: We see a creature with wings.
sent14: • Conclusion: The creature is likely to be a bird.
sent15: Abductive reasoning. Abductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on the best explanation for a given set of observations.
sent16: The conclusion is the most likely explanation based on the available evidence, but it is not necessarily certain.
sent17: For example:• Observation: The car cannot start and there is a puddle of liquid under the engine.
sent18: • Conclusion: The most likely explanation is that the car has a leak in the radiator.
sent19: Other types of reasoning include analogical reasoning, which involves making comparisons between two or more things in order to make inferences or arrive at conclusions; causal reasoning, which involves identifying and understanding the causes and effects of events or phenomena; and probabilistic reasoning, which involves making decisions or arriving at conclusions based on the likelihood or probability of certain outcomes.
sent20: Formal Reasoning vs Informal Reasoning.
sent21: Formal reasoning is a systematic and logical process that follows a set of rules and principles, often used in mathematics and logic.
sent22: Informal reasoning is a less structured approach that relies on intuition, experience, and common sense to draw conclusions and solve problems, and is often used in everyday life.
sent23: Formal reasoning is more structured and reliable, while informal reasoning is more adaptable and open-ended, but may also be less reliable.
sent24: We refer the reader to Galotti (1989); Bronkhorst et al. (2020) for a detailed distinction between them.
sent25: Reasoning in Language Models. The concept of reasoning in language models has been around for some time, but there is not a clear definition of what it entails.
sent26: In the literature, the term ""reasoning"" is often used to refer to informal reasoning, although it is not always explicitly stated that it is informal (Cobbe et al., 2021;Wei et al., 2022b, inter alia).
sent27: Different forms of reasoning may be used depending on the task, benchmark, or method being used, e.g., deductive reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021;Creswell et al., 2022;Han et al., 2022b, inter alia), inductive reasoning Misra et al., 2022, inter alia) or abductive reasoning (Wiegreffe et al., 2022;Lampinen et al., 2022;Jung et al., 2022, inter alia).
sent28: In this paper, we encompass various forms of reasoning, with a particular focus on ""informal deductive reasoning"" in large language models since it is a widely used form in which the conclusion is guaranteed to be true as long as the premises are true.","1. (What is reasoning?): sent1

What are the key findings regarding the reasoning abilities of large language models?

Answer:

Reasoning appears to be an emergent ability of large language models.

Wei et al. (2022a,b) show that reasoning ability appears to emerge only in large language models like GPT-3 175B, as evidenced by significant improvements in performance on reasoning tasks at a certain scale (e.g., 100 billion parameters).

The use of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts (Wei et al., 2022b) has been shown to improve the performance of large language models on various reasoning tasks, as demonstrated in the experiments of Wei et al. (2022a,b).

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like content effects on reasoning.

According to Dasgupta et al. (2022), LLMs exhibit reasoning patterns that are similar to those of humans as described in the cognitive literature.

Despite these advancements, LLMs are still unskilled at complex reasoning.","The key findings regarding the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) include:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: LLMs excel at recognizing and generating patterns based on the vast amounts of text data they have been trained on. This allows them to perform well on tasks that involve language understanding and generation.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: LLMs can understand and maintain context over relatively long passages of text, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

3. **Limitations in Deep Reasoning**: While LLMs can mimic reasoning to some extent, they often struggle with tasks that require deep logical reasoning, abstract thinking, or understanding complex cause-and-effect relationships.

4. **Dependence on Training Data**: The reasoning abilities of LLMs are heavily dependent on the quality and diversity of the training data. They may exhibit biases or inaccuracies present in the data they were trained on.

5. **Prompt Engineering**: The performance of LLMs in reasoning tasks can be significantly influenced by how prompts are structured. Carefully crafted prompts can lead to better reasoning performance.

6. **Emergent Abilities**: As LLMs increase in size and complexity, they exhibit emergent abilities that were not explicitly programmed, including improved performance on certain reasoning tasks.

8. **Tool Use and External Knowledge**: Integrating LLMs with external tools or databases can enhance their reasoning capabilities by providing access to up-to-date and specialized information.

Overall, while LLMs demonstrate impressive capabilities in language understanding and generation, their reasoning abilities are still limited compared to human reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring deep logical analysis and abstract thinking.",What are the key findings from recent studies regarding the reasoning abilities of large language models?,What are the key findings regarding the emergence and limitations of reasoning abilities in large language models?,"Reasoning appears to be an emergent ability of large language models (LLMs). Studies by Wei et al. (2022a,b) indicate that reasoning capabilities become evident only in large models like GPT-3 175B, with significant performance improvements on reasoning tasks observed at scales around 100 billion parameters. This suggests that large models may be more effective for general reasoning problems compared to smaller, task-specific models.

The use of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts has been shown to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs. Experiments by Wei et al. (2022a,b) demonstrate that CoT prompts can lead to dramatic improvements in reasoning tasks, and Saparov and He (2022) find that CoT prompts enable LLMs to produce valid individual proof steps, even in fictional or counterfactual scenarios. Additionally, CoT prompts improve the out-of-distribution robustness of LLMs, a benefit not typically seen with standard prompting or fully supervised finetuning.

LLMs exhibit human-like content effects on reasoning. According to Dasgupta et al.

Despite these advancements, LLMs are still unskilled at complex reasoning.","sent1: In this section, we summarize the important findings and implications of studies on reasoning in large language models.
sent2: Reasoning seems an emergent ability of LLMs.
sent3: Wei et al. (2022a,b);  show that reasoning ability appears to emerge only in large language models like GPT-3 175B, as evidenced by significant improvements in performance on reasoning tasks at a certain scale (e.g., 100 billion parameters).
sent4: This suggests that it may be more effective to utilize large models for general reasoning problems rather than training small models for specific tasks.
sent5: However, the reason for this emergent ability is not yet fully understood.
sent6: We refer the reader to Wei et al. (2022a);Fu et al. (2022a) for some potential explanations.
sent7: Chain of thought elicits ""reasoning"" of LLMs.
sent8: The use of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts (Wei et al., 2022b) has been shown to improve the performance of LLMs on various reasoning tasks, as demonstrated in the experiments of Wei et al. (2022a,b); .
sent9: Additionally, Saparov and He (2022) ( §4.2) find that, when using CoT prompts, LLMs are able to produce valid individual proof steps, even when the synthetic ontology is fictional or counterfactual.
sent10: However, they may sometimes choose the wrong steps when multiple options are available, leading to incomplete or incorrect proofs.
sent11: Moreover, for many reasoning tasks where the performance of standard prompting grows smoothly with model scale, chain-of-thought prompting can lead to dramatic performance improvement.
sent12: In addition to these benefits, the use of CoT prompts has been shown to improve the out-ofdistribution robustness of LLMs (Wei et al., 2022b;Zhou et al., 2022a;Anil et al., 2022, inter alia), an advantage that is not typically observed with standard prompting or fully supervised finetuning paradigms.
sent13: LLMs show human-like content effects on reasoning.
sent14: According to Dasgupta et al. (2022), LLMs exhibit reasoning patterns that are similar to those of humans as described in the cognitive literature.
sent15: For example, the models' predictions are influenced by both prior knowledge and abstract reasoning, and their judgments of logical validity are impacted by the believability of the conclusions.
sent16: These findings suggest that, although language models may not always perform well on reasoning tasks, their failures often occur in situations that are challenging for humans as well.
sent17: This provides some evidence that language models may ""reason"" in a way that is similar to human reasoning.
sent18: LLMs are still unskilled at complex reasoning.
sent19: Although LLMs seem to possess impressive reasoning capabilities with the techniques described in §3, they still struggle with more complex reasoning tasks or those involving implicature, according to studies such as Valmeekam et al. (2022);Han et al. (2022a); Ruis et al. (2022).
sent20: For instance, Valmeekam et al. (2022) find that even in relatively simple commonsense planning domains that humans would have no trouble navigating, LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) struggle to perform effectively.
sent21: These findings suggest that existing benchmarks may be too simple to accurately gauge the true reasoning abilities of LLMs, and that more challenging tasks may be needed to fully evaluate their abilities in this regard.","# QUA Analysis:

Representative benchmarks for arithmetic reasoning include GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), Math (Hendrycks et al., 2021), MathQA (Amini et al., 2019), SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021), AS-Div (Miao et al., 2020), AQuA (Ling et al., 2017), and MAWPS (Roy and Roth, 2015).

BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022), for example, includes over 200 tasks that test a range of reasoning skills, including tasks like Date Understanding, Word Sorting, and Causal Judgement.

Other benchmarks, such as SCAN (Lake and Baroni, 2018) and the one proposed by Anil et al. (2022), focus on evaluating generalization ability.

LLMs can also be tested on their table reasoning abilities using benchmarks such as WikiTableQA (Pasupat and Liang, 2015) and FetaQA (Nan et al., 2022), as suggested by Chen (2022).

In addition, there are benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' generative relational reasoning abilities, such as CommonGen (Lin et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022a) and Open Relation Modeling (Huang et al., 2022b,d).","Common benchmarks used to evaluate the reasoning abilities of large language models include:

1. **GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)**: A collection of diverse natural language understanding tasks designed to evaluate models on a wide range of linguistic phenomena.

2. **SuperGLUE**: An extension of GLUE with more challenging tasks, aimed at pushing the limits of language understanding.

3. **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: A reading comprehension dataset where models must answer questions based on given passages.

4. **ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge)**: A dataset designed to test the reasoning abilities of models through multiple-choice science questions.

5. **DROP (Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs)**: A reading comprehension benchmark that requires discrete reasoning over paragraphs of text.

6. **HellaSwag**: A commonsense reasoning benchmark that tests a model's ability to predict the most plausible continuation of a given scenario.

7. **CommonsenseQA**: A multiple-choice question answering dataset that requires commonsense knowledge to answer.

8. **Winograd Schema Challenge**: A test of commonsense reasoning where models must resolve pronoun references in sentences.

9. **BoolQ (Boolean Questions)**: A dataset for yes/no questions that require understanding and reasoning over passages.

10. **ReClor**: A dataset for logical reasoning in reading comprehension, focusing on questions from standardized tests like the LSAT.

Future efforts in this direction will benefit social influence dialogue systems as well.","Evaluating social influence dialogue systems presents several key limitations and future directions:

### Key Limitations:
1. **Subjectivity in Evaluation**: Social influence is inherently subjective, making it challenging to develop standardized metrics for evaluation. What influences one person may not influence another.
2. **Context Sensitivity**: The effectiveness of social influence can vary greatly depending on the context, including cultural, social, and individual differences. This variability complicates the creation of universal evaluation criteria.
3. **Longitudinal Impact**: Social influence often has long-term effects that are difficult to measure in short-term interactions. Current evaluation methods may not capture the sustained impact of the dialogue system.
4. **Ethical Considerations**: Evaluating the influence of dialogue systems raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding manipulation and consent. Ensuring that systems are used responsibly is a significant challenge.
5. **Complexity of Human Behavior**: Human behavior and decision-making are influenced by a multitude of factors, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the dialogue system from other variables.

### Future Directions:
1. **Development of Standardized Metrics**: Creating more robust and standardized metrics that can account for the subjective nature of social influence. This may include multi-dimensional scales that consider various aspects of influence.
2. **Context-Aware Evaluation**: Developing evaluation frameworks that can adapt to different contexts and account for cultural, social, and individual differences. This could involve more personalized evaluation methods.
3. **Longitudinal Studies**: Conducting long-term studies to better understand the sustained impact of social influence dialogue systems. This would provide more comprehensive insights into their effectiveness.
4. **Ethical Frameworks**: Establishing ethical guidelines and frameworks to ensure that the evaluation and deployment of these systems are conducted responsibly. This includes obtaining informed consent and ensuring transparency.
5. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: Leveraging insights from psychology, sociology, and behavioral economics to create more holistic evaluation methods. This interdisciplinary approach can help in understanding the complex nature of social influence.
6. **User-Centric Evaluation**: Involving users in the evaluation process to gather qualitative feedback and understand their perspectives on the influence exerted by the dialogue system. This can provide valuable insights that quantitative metrics may miss.

sent4: Building user simulators could potentially alleviate this problem (Li et al., 2016;Jain et al., 2018;. Most existing simulators are developed for task-oriented systems which follow a certain agenda. Future research should study how to use partner modeling to build social influence user simulators for more efficient and accurate task evaluation (He et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2020).
sent5: For instance, one could potentially design different user personalities and simulate the change in user's beliefs, opinions, and attitudes accordingly (Yang et al., 2021).
sent6: Multimodal systems: Being a core function of human communication, social influence occurs not just through text, but through all possible modalities.
sent7: Schulman and Bickmore (2009) showed that embodied agents achieve better persuasion results than text-only agents.
sent8: Other studies have recognized the importance of emotion in social influence tasks (Asai et al., 2020;Chawla et al., 2021a).
sent9: Nguyen et al. (2021) proposed a speech dataset in debates and study the influence of spoken tactics on persuasiveness across genders.
sent10: Given these findings, we encourage interdisciplinary efforts in the future to explore the developement of multimodal social influence agents.
sent11: Knowledge-enriched systems: Social influence tasks often involve constantly-changing world knowledge such as organization facts and news.
sent12: Often, the system's internal state (e.g., the change of task setting from one set of products to a different set) needs to be updated.
sent13: Retraining the entire system is costly to maintain after the initial development.
sent14: Recent work has proposed to augment the dialogue system with internet-search ability to generate more factual and updated responses in open-domain dialogues (Komeili et al., 2021).
sent15: Future efforts in this direction will benefit social influence dialogue systems as well.","# QUA Analysis:

What are the challenges in developing dialogue systems for social influence tasks?

Answer:

None","Developing dialogue systems for social influence tasks presents several challenges:

1. **Understanding and Generating Natural Language**: The system must accurately understand and generate human-like responses, which requires advanced natural language processing capabilities.

2. **Context Awareness**: The system needs to maintain context over long conversations, understanding the nuances and subtleties of human dialogue.

3. **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognizing and appropriately responding to the user's emotions is crucial for effective social influence.

4. **Personalization**: The system should tailor its responses based on the individual user's preferences, history, and personality.

5. **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring that the system's influence is ethical and does not manipulate users in harmful ways is a significant concern.

6. **Cultural Sensitivity**: The system must be aware of and sensitive to cultural differences that can affect communication and influence.

7. **Trust and Credibility**: Building and maintaining trust with users is essential for the system to be effective in social influence tasks.

8. **Real-time Processing**: The system must process and respond to inputs in real-time to maintain a natural flow of conversation.

9. **Handling Ambiguity and Uncertainty**: The system must deal with ambiguous or incomplete information and still provide coherent and relevant responses.

10. **Evaluation Metrics**: Developing appropriate metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the dialogue system in social influence tasks is challenging.

Dialogue Acts (DAs) are another method, where acts such as greeting, offer, propose, agreement, or disagreement are used to capture a high-level structure of the dialogue flow in social influence settings, reducing the model strategy to first predicting the dialogue act for the next response.","In social influence dialogue systems, various methods can be employed to represent system strategy. These methods include:

1. **Rule-Based Systems**: These systems use predefined rules and heuristics to guide the dialogue. The rules are often crafted based on expert knowledge and are designed to handle specific scenarios in the conversation.

2. **Machine Learning Models**: These models learn strategies from data. They can be trained on large datasets of dialogues to predict the best responses based on the context. Techniques such as reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and deep learning are commonly used.

3. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining rule-based systems with machine learning models can leverage the strengths of both. Rules can handle straightforward cases, while machine learning models can manage more complex and nuanced interactions.

4. **Scripted Dialogue**: Predefined scripts can be used to guide the conversation flow. These scripts are often designed to achieve specific goals and can be tailored to different scenarios.

5. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: MDPs can model the dialogue as a series of states and actions, optimizing the strategy to maximize a reward function over time.

6. **Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)**: These extend MDPs by accounting for uncertainty in the system's state, making them suitable for more complex and realistic dialogue scenarios.

7. **Game-Theoretic Approaches**: These methods model the dialogue as a game between the system and the user, using strategies that consider the potential actions and responses of both parties.

8. **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**: Advanced NLG techniques can be used to generate responses that align with the system's strategy, ensuring that the dialogue remains coherent and contextually appropriate.

Each of these methods has its own advantages and can be chosen based on the specific requirements and constraints of the social influence dialogue system being developed.","What are some specific methods for representing system strategy in social influence dialogue systems, particularly those that involve implicit representation, latent vectors, or dialogue acts?","What are some specific methods for representing system strategy in social influence dialogue systems, including implicit and decoupled approaches?","One method to represent the system strategy in social influence dialogue systems is implicitly, without any intended decoupling between system strategy and response realization. This approach corresponds to the usual sequence-to-sequence framework, as exemplified by the work of Lewis et al. (2017), who trained end-to-end dialogue models using GRUs to encode the negotiation context and dialogue utterances, and generate output agreements in a bidirectional manner.

Another method involves using latent vectors to decouple utterance semantics from its linguistic aspects. Yarats and Lewis (2018) employed a hierarchical approach that constructs a latent vector from the input message, which is then used for response generation and planning. These latent vectors are trained to maximize the likelihood of future dialogue messages and actions, enabling the decoupling between semantics and realization.

Dialogue Acts (DAs) are also used to represent system strategy. DAs such as greeting, offer, propose, agreement, or disagreement capture a high-level structure of the dialogue flow in social influence settings.

These metrics can be broadly categorized into accuracy metrics, ranking metrics, and user satisfaction metrics. Here are some of the key metrics:

1. **Accuracy Metrics:**
   - **Precision:** Measures the proportion of relevant items among the recommended items.
   - **Recall:** Measures the proportion of relevant items that have been recommended out of all relevant items.
   - **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual ratings.
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual ratings.

2. **Ranking Metrics:**
   - **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR):** Measures the average of the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant item.
   - **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG):** Measures the ranking quality by considering the position of relevant items in the recommendation list.
   - **Hit Rate:** Measures the proportion of users for whom at least one relevant item is recommended.
   - **Mean Average Precision (MAP):** Measures the mean of the average precision scores for each user.

3. **User Satisfaction Metrics:**
   - **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Measures the proportion of recommended items that are clicked by users.
   - **Conversion Rate:** Measures the proportion of recommended items that lead to a desired action, such as a purchase.
   - **User Engagement:** Measures how much time users spend interacting with the recommended items.
   - **User Retention:** Measures the proportion of users who return to use the recommender system over a period of time.

4. **Diversity and Novelty Metrics:**
   - **Diversity:** Measures how varied the recommended items are, ensuring that recommendations are not too similar to each other.
   - **Novelty:** Measures how new or unexpected the recommended items are to the user, promoting the discovery of new content.

5. **Coverage Metrics:**
   - **Item Coverage:** Measures the proportion of items in the catalog that are recommended to users.
   - **User Coverage:** Measures the proportion of users who receive recommendations.

These metrics help in evaluating different aspects of the recommender system's performance, ensuring that it not only provides accurate and relevant recommendations but also enhances user satisfaction and engagement.","What evaluation metrics are used to assess the quality of language model-based recommender systems, including those for generated text and explanations?",What evaluation metrics are used to assess the quality and relevance of generated text in language model-based recommender systems?,"To assess the quality and relevance of generated text in language model-based recommender systems (LMRSs), several evaluation metrics are used:

1. **Relevance and Lexicon Overlap**:
   - **BLEU** and **ROUGE**: These metrics are commonly adopted to automatically evaluate the relevance of generated text based on lexicon overlap.

2. **Fluency, Diversity, and Informativeness**:
   - **Perplexity (PPL)**: Measures the fluency of the generated text.
   - **Distinct-n**: Evaluates the diversity of the generated text.
   - **Unique Sentence Ratio (USR)**: Assesses the informativeness of the generated text.

3. **Factual Correctness and Ground Truth Alignment**:
   - **Entailment Ratio**: Used to measure if the generated explanations are factually correct.
   - **MAUVE**: Measures how close the generated contents are to the ground truth corpus.

4. **Feature Diversity and Text-Image Alignment**:
   - **Feature Diversity (DIV)**: Evaluates the diversity of features in the generated explanations.
   - **CLIPScore (CS)**: Measures the alignment between generated text and images.

What evaluation metrics are used to assess the quality and relevance of generated text in language model-based recommender systems?

Answer:

To assess the quality and relevance of generated text in language model-based recommender systems (LMRSs), several evaluation metrics are used:

1. **Relevance and Lexicon Overlap**:
   - **BLEU** and **ROUGE**: These metrics are commonly adopted to automatically evaluate the relevance of generated text based on lexicon overlap.

2. **Fluency, Diversity, and Informativeness**:
   - **Perplexity (PPL)**: Measures the fluency of the generated text.
   - **Distinct-n**: Evaluates the diversity of the generated text.
   - **Unique Sentence Ratio (USR)**: Assesses the informativeness of the generated text.

3. **Factual Correctness and Ground Truth Alignment**:
   - **Entailment Ratio**: Used to measure if the generated explanations are factually correct.
   - **MAUVE**: Measures how close the generated contents are to the ground truth corpus.

4. **Feature Diversity and Text-Image Alignment**:
   - **Feature Diversity (DIV)**: Evaluates the diversity of features in the generated explanations.
   - **CLIPScore (CS)**: Measures the alignment between generated text and images.

5. **Conversational Recommendations**:
   - **Item Ratio**: Assesses the system's capability to provide item recommendations within the final generated responses during conversations.

Additionally, human evaluation is used to complement these objective metrics, as automatic metrics may not always align with subjective user feedback.","Apart from well-known metrics such as RMSE, MAP, AUC, MAE, Recall, Precision, MRR, NDCG, F1-score, and HitRate in offline mode, some works define Group AUC or User Group AUC to evaluate the utility of group recommendations.

In such cases, BLEU and ROUGE are commonly adopted to automatically evaluate the relevance of generated text based on lexicon overlap.

Additionally, Perplexity (PPL), Distinct-n, and Unique Sentence Ratio (USR) are also widely used metrics to measure fluency, diversity, and informativeness of generated texts.

For instance, Xie et al. (2023) adopted Entailment Ratio and MAUVE to measure if the generated explanations are factually correct and how close the generated contents are to the ground truth corpus, respectively.

Geng et al. (2022a) adopted Feature Diversity (DIV) and CLIPScore (CS) to measure the generated explanations and text-image alignment.

The NSP/SOP can be adapted for CTR prediction as Next K Behaviors Prediction (NBP).","Language modeling objectives are adapted for recommendation systems by treating the sequence of user interactions (such as clicks, views, or purchases) as a ""sentence"" and each interaction as a ""word"" within that sentence. This approach allows the recommendation system to predict the next item a user might interact with, similar to how a language model predicts the next word in a sentence. Techniques such as next-item prediction, sequence-to-sequence modeling, and masked item prediction are commonly used. These methods leverage the sequential nature of user interactions to capture patterns and preferences, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.",How are Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objectives adapted for recommendation systems?,How are language modeling objectives specifically adapted to account for user interaction patterns in recommendation systems?,"Language modeling objectives are specifically adapted to account for user interaction patterns in recommendation systems through various modifications and techniques:

1. **Modified MLM Objectives**: Yuan et al. (2020a) noted that sequential dependency may not always strictly hold in user preferences. To address this, Yuan et al. (2020b) proposed randomly masking a certain percentage of historical user records and predicting the masked items during training.

2. **Rearrange Sequence Prediction**: Zhao (2022) introduced the Rearrange Sequence Prediction task, which pre-trains models to learn sequence-level information of a user's entire interaction history by predicting whether the user interaction history has been rearranged. This is similar to Permuted Language Modelling (PerLM) (Yang et al., 2019).

3. **Graph Representations**: MLM, also known as Cloze Prediction, can be adapted to learn graph representations. For instance, a transformer model can be pre-trained on a reconstructed subgraph from a user-item-attribute heterogeneous graph using objectives like Masked Node Prediction (MNP) and Masked Edge Prediction (MEP).

4. **Masked Multimodal Modelling (MMM)**: Wu et al. (2022a) adapted MLM to multi-modal data by predicting the semantics of masked news and news image regions given the unmasked inputs. This also involves determining whether a news image and news content segment correspond to each other for news recommendation purposes.

5. **Next K Behaviors Prediction (NBP)**: The NSP/SOP objectives can be adapted for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction as NBP. NBP learns user representations in the pre-training stage by inferring whether a candidate behavior is the next i-th behavior of the target user based on their past N behaviors, capturing the relatedness between past and multiple future behaviors.","Questions:

How are language modeling objectives specifically adapted to account for user interaction patterns in recommendation systems?

Answer:

Language modeling objectives are specifically adapted to account for user interaction patterns in recommendation systems through various modifications and techniques:

1. **Modified MLM Objectives**: Yuan et al. (2020a) noted that sequential dependency may not always strictly hold in user preferences. To address this, Yuan et al. (2020b) proposed randomly masking a certain percentage of historical user records and predicting the masked items during training.

2. **Rearrange Sequence Prediction**: Zhao (2022) introduced the Rearrange Sequence Prediction task, which pre-trains models to learn sequence-level information of a user's entire interaction history by predicting whether the user interaction history has been rearranged. This is similar to Permuted Language Modelling (PerLM) (Yang et al., 2019).

3. **Graph Representations**: MLM, also known as Cloze Prediction, can be adapted to learn graph representations. For instance, a transformer model can be pre-trained on a reconstructed subgraph from a user-item-attribute heterogeneous graph using objectives like Masked Node Prediction (MNP) and Masked Edge Prediction (MEP).

MLM, also known as Cloze Prediction, can be adapted to learn graph representations for different recommendation purposes.

MMM was performed by predicting the semantics of masked news and news image regions given the unmasked inputs and indicating whether a news image and news content segment correspond to each other for news recommendation purposes.

The NSP/SOP can be adapted for CTR prediction as Next K Behaviors Prediction (NBP).","sent1: Numerous pre-training or fine-tuning objectives draw inspiration from LM objectives and have been effectively applied to specific downstream tasks based on the input data types and recommendation goals.
sent2: In sequential recommendations, there is a common interest in modelling an ordered input sequence in an auto-regressive manner from left to right.
sent3: Analogous to text sentences,  and Xiao et al. (2022) treated the user's clicked news history as input text and proposed to model user behavior in an auto-regressive manner for next-click prediction.
sent4: However, as the sequential dependency may not always hold strictly in terms of user preference for recommendations (Yuan et al., 2020a), MLM objectives can be modified accordingly.
sent5: Yuan et al. (2020b) randomly masked a certain percentage of historical user records and predicted the masked items during training.
sent6: Autoregressive learning tasks can also be adapted to other types of data.
sent7: Geng et al. (2022b) modeled a series of paths sampled from a knowledge graph in an auto-regressive manner for recommendation by generating the end node from the pretrained model.

sent9: proposed pre-training a transformer model on a reconstructed subgraph from a user-item-attribute heterogeneous graph, using Masked Node Prediction (MNP), Masked Edge Prediction (MEP), and meta-path type prediction as objectives.
sent10: Specifically, MNP was performed by randomly masking a proportion of nodes in a heterogeneous subgraph and then predicting the masked nodes based on the remaining contexts by maximizing the distance between the masked node and the irrelevant node.
sent11: Similarly, MEP was used to recover the masked edge of two adjacent nodes based on the surrounding context.
sent12: Apart from that, MLM can also be adapted to multi-modal data called Masked Multimodal Modelling (MMM) (Wu et al., 2022a).
sent13: MMM was performed by predicting the semantics of masked news and news image regions given the unmasked inputs and indicating whether a news image and news content segment correspond to each other for news recommendation purposes.

What are the main challenges associated with typological databases in linguistics?

Answer:

None","The main challenges associated with typological databases in linguistics include:

1. **Data Consistency and Standardization**: Ensuring that data from different languages are consistently categorized and standardized can be difficult due to the diversity of linguistic structures and terminologies.

2. **Data Completeness**: Many languages, especially lesser-studied or endangered ones, may have incomplete or insufficient data, making comprehensive typological analysis challenging.

3. **Data Quality and Reliability**: The accuracy and reliability of the data can vary, particularly if the data sources are outdated, based on secondary reports, or collected by researchers with varying levels of expertise.

4. **Cross-Linguistic Comparability**: Creating meaningful comparisons across languages requires careful consideration of linguistic and cultural contexts, which can be complex and nuanced.

5. **Technological and Computational Issues**: Managing large datasets, ensuring database interoperability, and developing user-friendly interfaces for data entry and retrieval can pose significant technical challenges.

6. **Ethical Considerations**: Issues related to the ownership, use, and sharing of linguistic data, especially from indigenous and minority language communities, require careful ethical consideration and respect for the rights of language speakers.

7. **Resource Limitations**: Developing and maintaining comprehensive typological databases requires significant resources, including funding, expertise, and time, which may be limited.

What is a limitation of two-stage supervised keyphrase extraction approaches?

Answer:

None","A limitation of two-stage supervised keyphrase extraction approaches is that they often rely heavily on the quality and quantity of labeled training data. These approaches typically involve an initial stage of candidate phrase generation followed by a classification stage to identify keyphrases. If the training data is not sufficiently representative or comprehensive, the model may struggle to generalize well to new, unseen documents.

### Challenges:

1. **Quality of Weak Labels**:
   - **Challenge**: Weak supervision often relies on heuristics, distant supervision, or noisy labels, which may not be as accurate or reliable as manually curated labels.
   - **Solution**: Employ techniques to filter or denoise weak labels, such as using agreement among multiple weak sources or leveraging semi-supervised learning to refine the labels.

2. **Domain Adaptation**:
   - **Challenge**: Models trained on weakly supervised data from one domain may not generalize well to a new domain due to domain-specific language, context, or user behavior.
   - **Solution**: Use domain adaptation techniques, such as fine-tuning the model on a small amount of labeled data from the new domain or employing transfer learning to leverage knowledge from related domains.

3. **Data Sparsity**:
   - **Challenge**: In new domains, there may be limited data available, making it difficult to train robust models.
   - **Solution**: Augment the training data with synthetic examples, use data augmentation techniques, or leverage pre-trained models that have been trained on large, diverse datasets.

4. **Model Complexity**:
   - **Challenge**: Neural ranking models can be complex and require significant computational resources, which may be a barrier in new domains with limited infrastructure.
   - **Solution**: Optimize model architectures for efficiency, use model distillation to create smaller, faster models, or employ cloud-based solutions to handle computational demands.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Challenge**: Standard evaluation metrics may not fully capture the performance of ranking models in new domains, where user behavior and expectations might differ.
   - **Solution**: Develop domain-specific evaluation metrics or use a combination of metrics to get a comprehensive understanding of model performance.

6. **Bias and Fairness**:
   - **Challenge**: Weak supervision can introduce biases from the sources of weak labels, which may lead to unfair or biased ranking results.
   - **Solution**: Implement fairness-aware learning algorithms, conduct bias audits, and use techniques to mitigate bias in the training data and model outputs.

### Solutions:

1. **Hybrid Supervision**:
   - Combine weak supervision with a small amount of high-quality labeled data to improve the overall quality of the training data.

2. **Active Learning**:
   - Use active learning to selectively label the most informative examples, thereby improving the model with minimal labeling effort.

3. **Self-Training**:
   - Use the model's own predictions to iteratively improve its performance, leveraging confident predictions as additional training data.

4. **Ensemble Methods**:
   - Combine multiple models trained on different weak supervision sources to improve robustness and reduce the impact of noisy labels.

5. **Regularization Techniques**:
   - Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting to noisy labels and improve generalization to new domains.

What are the three popular types of models used to provide weak supervision signals for question-document pairs?

Answer:

None","The three popular types of models used to provide weak supervision signals for question-document pairs are:

1. **Retrieval Models**: These models are designed to retrieve relevant documents or passages from a large corpus based on the given question. They typically use techniques such as TF-IDF, BM25, or more advanced neural retrieval models like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR).

2. **Reading Comprehension Models**: These models focus on understanding and extracting answers from the retrieved documents or passages. They are trained to read the text and identify the span of text that answers the question. Examples include models like BERT, RoBERTa, and other transformer-based architectures fine-tuned for question answering tasks.

3. **Generative Models**: These models generate answers to questions based on the content of the documents. They can produce more flexible and natural language responses. Examples include models like GPT-3 and T5, which can be fine-tuned to generate answers by conditioning on the question and the relevant document content.

These models can be used individually or in combination to provide weak supervision signals, helping to improve the performance of question answering systems.",What are the three popular types of models used to provide weak supervision signals for question-document pairs in question answering systems?,What are the three popular types of models used to provide weak supervision signals for question-document pairs in question answering systems?,,"Questions:

What are the main strategies to reduce noise effects in weak supervision signals for neural ranking models?

Answer:

None","To reduce noise effects in weak supervision signals for neural ranking models, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Data Augmentation and Cleaning**: Enhance the quality of the training data by augmenting it with additional relevant data and cleaning it to remove obvious noise and errors.

2. **Noise-Robust Loss Functions**: Use loss functions that are designed to be robust to noisy labels, such as the mean absolute error (MAE) instead of mean squared error (MSE), or more sophisticated approaches like the noise-robust versions of cross-entropy loss.

3. **Regularization Techniques**: Apply regularization methods such as dropout, weight decay, or early stopping to prevent the model from overfitting to noisy data.

4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions from multiple models to average out the noise. This can be done through techniques like bagging, boosting, or stacking.

5. **Confidence Estimation**: Assign confidence scores to the weak supervision signals and weigh them accordingly during training. This can help the model to focus more on high-confidence signals.

6. **Self-Training and Semi-Supervised Learning**: Use a small amount of high-quality labeled data to guide the learning process and iteratively refine the weak supervision signals.

7. **Curriculum Learning**: Train the model on easier, less noisy examples first and gradually introduce more difficult and noisier examples. This helps the model to build a strong foundation before dealing with more complex data.

8. **Denoising Autoencoders**: Use autoencoders to learn a compressed representation of the data that can help in filtering out noise.

9. **Adversarial Training**: Train the model with adversarial examples to make it more robust to noise.

10. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Incorporate human feedback to correct and refine the weak supervision signals periodically.

By implementing these strategies, the impact of noise in weak supervision signals can be mitigated, leading to more accurate and robust neural ranking models.",What are some effective methods to mitigate the impact of noise in weak supervision signals for training neural ranking models?,What are the primary methods to mitigate noise in weak supervision signals for neural ranking models?,,"Questions:

sent7: Apply less strict margin-based loss such as the hinge loss (Dehghani et al., 2017;Xu et al., 2019) and MarginMSE loss (Hofstätter et al., 2020;, then models have fewer chances of overfitting to the exact labels, and (2)
sent8: Apply noise-resistant training methods such as confidence-based filtering (Mukherjee and Awadallah, 2020;Yu et al., 2021b) and metalearning-based refinement (Ren et al., 2018;Zhu et al., 2022).
sent9: Another potential issue is that the amount of training data in this section relies on the amount of questions we have.
sent10: Unlike the document set which we can obtain for free, the question set takes time to collect and are often orders of magnitudes smaller.
sent11: If no sufficient questions are available, we can use synthetic questions from question generation, then apply same WS signals in this section, which has been shown to perform on par with using real questions in certain domains Thakur et al., 2022).","# QUA Analysis:

Answer:

In machine translation, Fernandes et al. (2022) and Freitag et al. (2022a) build upon recent advances in automatic quality estimation and evaluation via feedback model training to improve generation.

Their framework comprises a candidate generation stage followed by a ranking stage, where candidates are scored using quality metrics trained to regress on human assessments (reward models) (Rei et al., 2020a,b) via N-best list reranking or minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding (Kumar and Byrne, 2002).

The highest-scoring candidate is then chosen as the final translation.","Feedback models improve machine translation quality by incorporating user feedback to refine and enhance the translation process. Here are several ways in which feedback models contribute to better machine translation:

1. **Error Correction**: Users can provide corrections for inaccurate translations, allowing the model to learn from its mistakes and reduce similar errors in future translations.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: Feedback helps the model understand the context better, especially in cases where direct translations may not capture the intended meaning. This is particularly useful for idiomatic expressions, cultural nuances, and domain-specific terminology.

3. **Personalization**: Feedback can be used to tailor translations to individual user preferences and specific use cases, improving the relevance and accuracy of the output.

4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular feedback creates a loop of continuous learning and improvement, enabling the model to stay updated with evolving language usage and new linguistic patterns.

5. **Quality Metrics**: User feedback provides valuable data for evaluating the quality of translations, helping developers identify areas that need improvement and measure the impact of changes made to the model.

6. **Training Data Enhancement**: Feedback can be incorporated into the training data, enriching the dataset with real-world examples and corrections that improve the model's performance over time.

By leveraging user feedback, machine translation systems can become more accurate, context-aware, and user-friendly, ultimately leading to higher quality translations.",How do feedback models improve machine translation quality through candidate generation and ranking stages?,How do feedback models improve machine translation quality through candidate generation and ranking stages?,"In machine translation, feedback models improve quality through a two-stage process: candidate generation and ranking.

Furthermore, variability between human annotators has also not been fully explored (Plank, 2022; Gehrmann et al., 2022b).","Collecting human feedback for natural language generation (NLG) presents several challenges and opportunities for future research and development. Here are some key points:

### Challenges:

1. **Subjectivity and Variability**:
   - **Subjective Judgments**: Human feedback on language generation can be highly subjective, as different individuals may have varying opinions on what constitutes good or bad output.
   - **Inter-Annotator Variability**: Different annotators may provide inconsistent feedback, making it difficult to achieve a consensus on the quality of generated text.

2. **Scalability**:
   - **Resource-Intensive**: Collecting human feedback is time-consuming and expensive, especially when large datasets are required for training and evaluation.
   - **Limited Availability**: There may be a limited pool of qualified annotators, particularly for specialized domains or languages.

3. **Bias and Fairness**:
   - **Annotator Bias**: Human annotators may introduce their own biases into the feedback, which can affect the fairness and objectivity of the evaluation.
   - **Representation**: Ensuring diverse and representative feedback from different demographic groups is challenging but crucial for reducing bias in NLG systems.

4. **Quality and Consistency**:
   - **Quality Control**: Ensuring the quality and consistency of human feedback is difficult, especially when dealing with large-scale annotation efforts.
   - **Feedback Granularity**: Determining the appropriate level of granularity for feedback (e.g., sentence-level vs. document-level) can be challenging.

5. **Dynamic and Evolving Standards**:
   - **Changing Preferences**: Human preferences and standards for language quality can evolve over time, requiring continuous updates to feedback mechanisms.
   - **Context Sensitivity**: The appropriateness of generated text can be highly context-dependent, making it difficult to establish universal evaluation criteria.

### Future Directions:

1. **Automated and Semi-Automated Feedback**:
   - **AI-Assisted Annotation**: Developing AI tools to assist human annotators can help scale the feedback collection process and improve consistency.
   - **Active Learning**: Implementing active learning techniques where the model selectively queries humans for feedback on uncertain or ambiguous cases.

2. **Crowdsourcing and Community Involvement**:
   - **Crowdsourcing Platforms**: Leveraging crowdsourcing platforms to gather diverse and large-scale human feedback.
   - **Community Engagement**: Involving user communities in the feedback process to gather more relevant and context-specific evaluations.

3. **Bias Mitigation**:
   - **Bias Detection and Correction**: Developing methods to detect and correct biases in human feedback to ensure fair and unbiased evaluations.
   - **Diverse Annotator Pools**: Ensuring a diverse pool of annotators to capture a wide range of perspectives and reduce bias.

4. **Interactive and Real-Time Feedback**:
   - **User Interaction**: Implementing systems that allow users to provide real-time feedback during their interaction with NLG systems.
   - **Adaptive Learning**: Developing models that can adapt and improve based on continuous user feedback.

5. **Standardization and Benchmarking**:
   - **Evaluation Standards**: Establishing standardized metrics and benchmarks for human feedback in NLG to facilitate comparison and reproducibility.
   - **Best Practices**: Developing best practices and guidelines for collecting and utilizing human feedback effectively.

6. **Multimodal Feedback**:
   - **Beyond Text**: Incorporating feedback from other modalities (e.g., audio, visual) to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of generated content.
   - **Contextual Feedback**: Gathering feedback that considers the broader context in which the generated text is used.

Addressing these challenges and exploring these future directions can significantly enhance the quality and reliability of human feedback for natural language generation, ultimately leading to more effective and user-friendly NLG systems.","What are the challenges and future considerations in collecting human feedback for natural language generation, particularly regarding cost and annotator variability?","What are the challenges and future directions in collecting and utilizing human feedback for natural language generation, considering the cost and variability between annotators?","Collecting human feedback can be rather expensive and may present issues for the inexperienced, making it important to leverage existing resources and consider additional data collection carefully.

What factors should be considered when collecting human feedback data for natural language generation tasks?

Answer:

None","When collecting human feedback data for natural language generation (NLG) tasks, several factors should be considered to ensure the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data. These factors include:

1. **Diversity of Participants**: Ensure that the participants providing feedback come from diverse backgrounds, including different demographics, languages, and cultural contexts. This helps in capturing a wide range of perspectives and reduces bias.

2. **Expertise Level**: Depending on the task, it may be important to have feedback from both general users and domain experts. For example, medical text generation might require feedback from healthcare professionals.

3. **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear and detailed instructions to participants on how to evaluate the generated text. This includes defining the criteria for evaluation, such as fluency, coherence, relevance, and factual accuracy.

4. **Evaluation Criteria**: Establish well-defined and consistent criteria for feedback. Common criteria include grammatical correctness, semantic relevance, informativeness, and user satisfaction.

5. **Annotation Guidelines**: Develop comprehensive annotation guidelines to ensure that feedback is consistent and reliable across different annotators. This includes examples of good and bad responses.

6. **Quality Control**: Implement quality control measures to ensure the reliability of the feedback. This can include inter-annotator agreement checks, spot-checking annotations, and using gold-standard references.

7. **Feedback Format**: Decide on the format of the feedback, whether it will be qualitative (e.g., written comments) or quantitative (e.g., ratings on a Likert scale). Both types can provide valuable insights.

8. **Contextual Information**: Provide annotators with sufficient context for the text they are evaluating. This might include the preceding conversation, the intended use case, or any specific instructions given to the NLG system.

9. **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure that the data collection process respects the privacy and consent of the participants. Anonymize the data where necessary and obtain informed consent.

10. **Iterative Feedback**: Consider collecting feedback in an iterative manner, where the NLG system is improved based on initial feedback and then re-evaluated. This helps in refining the system progressively.

11. **Bias and Fairness**: Be aware of potential biases in the feedback and take steps to mitigate them. This includes being mindful of any biases that participants might have and ensuring that the feedback process does not reinforce existing biases in the NLG system.

12. **Scalability**: Ensure that the feedback collection process is scalable, especially if large amounts of data are needed. This might involve using crowdsourcing platforms or automated tools to assist in the annotation process.

(p6.1) We summarize 17 well-studied NL2Code benchmarks in Table 3, where we can find that each of these benchmarks has its own characteristics regarding size, language, complexity, and scenario. We observe that most benchmarks contain a limited number of instances. For example, the widely used HumanEval and MBPP have 164 and 974 instances, respectively. This is because these benchmarks are typically hand-written to ensure that LLMs have not seen them during training. In the era of large language models, it is crucial to avoid data leak-age when creating new benchmarks. Additionally, most current benchmarks have their problem descriptions in English and code solutions in Python.

(p6.2) Recently, several multi-lingual benchmarks have been proposed, such as MBXP (Athiwaratkun et al., 2022), HumanEvalX (Zheng et al., 2023), and Mul-tiPL (Cassano et al., 2022), which cover multiple programming languages, and ODEX (Wang et al., 2022c), which covers multiple natural languages. Details of multi-lingual benchmarks are listed in Appendix Table 7. Furthermore, benchmarks have been proposed for other practical scenarios, such as data science (Lai et al., 2022), public library (Zan et al., 2022b), private library (Zan et al., 2022a), multi-turn program synthesis (Nijkamp et al., 2023), and code security (Siddiq and msiddiq, 2022). For execution-based benchmarks, comprehensive test cases with complete coverage of the generated program can ensure the trustworthiness of evaluation results. As a reference, the average number of test cases for each benchmark, as well as the length statistics of the problem descriptions and solutions are also provided in Table 3.

(p6.3) Manually evaluating the generated code is impractical, which calls for the need for automatic metrics. The above mentioned benchmarks all provide test cases for execution-based evaluation, where metrics such as pass@k (Chen et al., 2021), n@k (Li et al., 2022b), test case aver-age (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and execution accuracy (Rajkumar et al., 2022) can be used. However, this approach has stringent requirements for the quality of test cases and can only evaluate executable code.

So far, there are many open challenges in designing metrics to evaluate various aspects of code, such as vulnerability, maintainability, clarity, execution complexity, and stability.","The characteristics and challenges of current NL2Code (Natural Language to Code) benchmarks and metrics can be summarized as follows:

### Characteristics:
1. **Diverse Datasets**: NL2Code benchmarks often include a variety of datasets that cover different programming languages, problem domains, and levels of complexity. Examples include datasets for SQL queries, Python functions, and general-purpose programming tasks.

2. **Real-World Scenarios**: Many benchmarks aim to reflect real-world coding scenarios, including common programming tasks, bug fixing, and code completion.

3. **Human-Written Code**: Benchmarks typically include human-written code as ground truth, which serves as a reference for evaluating the generated code.

4. **Natural Language Descriptions**: The benchmarks provide natural language descriptions or specifications of the coding tasks, which the models must interpret to generate the corresponding code.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Common metrics used for evaluation include exact match accuracy, BLEU score, and functional correctness. These metrics assess how well the generated code matches the reference code and whether it performs the intended function.

### Challenges:
1. **Ambiguity in Natural Language**: Natural language descriptions can be ambiguous, leading to multiple valid interpretations and corresponding code solutions. This makes it difficult to evaluate the correctness of the generated code.

2. **Complexity of Code**: As the complexity of the coding tasks increases, it becomes more challenging for models to generate correct and efficient code. This includes handling intricate logic, dependencies, and edge cases.

3. **Generalization**: Models often struggle to generalize from the training data to unseen tasks or domains. This is particularly challenging when the test data includes novel problems that were not covered during training.

4. **Evaluation Limitations**: Current evaluation metrics have limitations. For example, exact match accuracy does not account for functionally equivalent but syntactically different code. BLEU score, while useful, may not fully capture the functional correctness of the code.

5. **Data Quality and Bias**: The quality and representativeness of the datasets can impact the performance of NL2Code models. Biases in the training data can lead to biased or suboptimal code generation.

6. **Scalability**: As the size of the codebase and the complexity of the tasks increase, the computational resources required for training and inference also increase, posing scalability challenges.

7. **Human Evaluation**: While automated metrics are useful, human evaluation is often necessary to fully assess the quality and usability of the generated code. This is time-consuming and subjective.

Addressing these challenges requires ongoing research and development in natural language processing, machine learning, and software engineering.

What are the specific characteristics and challenges of current NL2Code benchmarks and evaluation metrics?

Answer:

Each of the 17 well-studied NL2Code benchmarks has unique characteristics regarding size, language, complexity, and scenario. Most benchmarks contain a limited number of instances, such as HumanEval with 164 instances and MBPP with 974 instances, because they are typically hand-written to ensure that LLMs have not seen them during training. Additionally, most current benchmarks have problem descriptions in English and code solutions in Python.

Recently, several multi-lingual benchmarks have been proposed, such as MBXP (Athiwaratkun et al., 2022), HumanEvalX (Zheng et al., 2023), and MultiPL (Cassano et al., 2022), which cover multiple programming languages, and ODEX (Wang et al., 2022c), which covers multiple natural languages. Benchmarks have also been proposed for other practical scenarios, such as data science (Lai et al., 2022), public library (Zan et al., 2022b), private library (Zan et al., 2022a), multi-turn program synthesis (Nijkamp et al., 2023), and code security (Siddiq and msiddiq, 2022).

For execution-based benchmarks, comprehensive test cases with complete coverage of the generated program can ensure the trustworthiness of evaluation results. Manually evaluating the generated code is impractical, necessitating automatic metrics. The mentioned benchmarks provide test cases for execution-based evaluation, where metrics such as pass@k (Chen et al., 2021), n@k (Li et al., 2022b), test case average (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and execution accuracy (Rajkumar et al., 2022) can be used. However, this approach requires high-quality test cases and can only evaluate executable code. For non-executable code, metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and CodeBLEU (Ren et al., 2020) are used, although they cannot precisely evaluate the correctness of the code.

What are common data pre-processing strategies for training large language models in NL2Code?

Answer:

To ensure the quality of the training corpus, it is common for large language models (LLMs) to perform data preprocessing on the significant amount of code in the collected data.

One common strategy is the removal of likely auto-generated or unfinished code files, as they are deemed to be meaningless.

Additionally, specific rules are employed to filter out uncommon code files.

These rules include factors such as the repository star rating, the file size, the line length, and the alphanumeric rate.

In summary, the goal of these pre-processing strategies is to achieve a code corpus that is unduplicated, complete, correct, clean, and general in nature.","Common data pre-processing strategies for training large language models in NL2Code (Natural Language to Code) include:

1. **Tokenization**: Breaking down the input text and code into smaller units (tokens) that the model can process. This often involves handling special characters, keywords, and syntax specific to programming languages.

2. **Normalization**: Standardizing the text and code to a consistent format. This can include converting all text to lowercase, removing extra whitespace, and standardizing code formatting.

3. **Filtering**: Removing irrelevant or low-quality data that could negatively impact model training. This might involve filtering out incomplete code snippets, non-English text, or examples that do not meet certain quality criteria.

4. **Data Augmentation**: Generating additional training examples by modifying existing ones. This can include paraphrasing natural language descriptions, introducing small variations in code, or using techniques like back-translation.

5. **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Ensuring that the dataset has a balanced representation of different types of code and natural language descriptions. This might involve oversampling underrepresented classes or undersampling overrepresented ones.

6. **Splitting Data**: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

7. **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and removing duplicate examples to ensure the model is not trained on redundant data, which can lead to overfitting.

8. **Encoding**: Converting text and code into numerical representations that the model can process. This often involves using embeddings or other encoding techniques to represent tokens in a high-dimensional space.

9. **Error Handling**: Identifying and correcting errors in the dataset, such as syntax errors in code or typos in natural language descriptions.

10. **Contextualization**: Providing additional context for each example, such as surrounding code or related documentation, to help the model understand the input better.

The task contains three steps: ZP detection, anaphoricity determination and reference linking.",,"Questions:

What are the main steps involved in zero pronoun resolution?

Answer:

None","Zero pronoun resolution is a process in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and resolving instances where pronouns are omitted, which is common in languages like Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. The main steps involved in zero pronoun resolution typically include:

1. **Detection**: Identifying the positions in the text where zero pronouns are likely to occur. This involves analyzing the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences to find gaps where a pronoun might be implied.

2. **Candidate Identification**: Generating a list of possible antecedents (the nouns or noun phrases that the zero pronouns refer to). This step often involves looking at the surrounding context, including previous sentences or clauses.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from the text that can help in determining the correct antecedent. These features might include syntactic, semantic, and discourse-related information.

4. **Antecedent Ranking**: Using the extracted features to rank the candidate antecedents. This can be done using various machine learning models or rule-based systems that evaluate the likelihood of each candidate being the correct antecedent.

5. **Resolution**: Selecting the most likely antecedent from the ranked list and resolving the zero pronoun by linking it to this antecedent.

6. **Validation**: Optionally, validating the resolution to ensure that it makes sense within the context of the text. This step might involve additional checks or human review.

These steps can be implemented using a combination of linguistic rules, statistical models, and machine learning techniques to achieve accurate zero pronoun resolution.",What are the detailed steps involved in the process of zero pronoun resolution in natural language processing?,What are the main steps involved in the process of zero pronoun resolution in natural language processing?,,"Questions:

nan",,"sent1: The task contains three steps: ZP detection, anaphoricity determination and reference linking.
sent2: Earlier works investigated rich features using traditional ML models (Zhao and Ng, 2007;Kong and Zhou, 2010;Chen andNg, 2013, 2015).
sent3: Recent studies exploited neural models to achieve the better performance (Chen and Ng, 2016;Yin et al., 2018;Song et al., 2020).
sent4: The CoNLL2011 and CoNLL2012 2 are commonlyused benchmarks on modeling unrestricted coreference.
sent5: The corpus contains 144K coreference instances, but dropped subjects only occupy 15%.
sent6: Zero Pronoun Recovery Given a source sentence, this aims to insert omitted pronouns in proper positions without changing the original meaning
sent7: (Yang and Xue, 2010;Yang et al., 2015Yang et al., , 2019a. It is different from ZP resolution, which identifies the antecedent of a referential pronoun (Mitkov, 2014).
sent8: Previous studies regarded ZP recovery as a classification or sequence labelling problem, which only achieve 40∼60% F1 scores on closed datasets Song et al., 2020), indicating the difficulty of generating ZPs.
sent9: It is worth noting that ZP recovery models can work for ZPT task in a pipeline manner: input sentences are labeled with ZPs using an external recovery system and then fed into a standard MT model (Chung and Gildea, 2010;Wang et al., 2016a).
sent10: Zero Pronoun Translation When pronouns are omitted in a source sentence, ZPT aims to generate ZPs in its target translation.
sent11: Early studies have investigate a number of works for SMT models (Chung and Gildea, 2010;Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010;Taira et al., 2012;Xiang et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2016a).
sent12: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in NMT Wang et al., 2018a), since the problem still exists in advanced NMT systems.
sent13: ZPT is also related to pronoun translation, which aims to correctly translate explicit pronoun in terms of feminine and masculine.

Here are some specific strategies:

1. **Data Augmentation**: Increase the diversity and amount of training data by generating synthetic examples where zero pronouns are explicitly annotated or replaced with their referents. This helps the model learn to handle zero pronouns more effectively.

2. **Annotation and Labeling**: Manually or semi-automatically annotate zero pronouns in the training data. This provides the model with clear examples of how zero pronouns are used and resolved in context.

3. **Parallel Corpora**: Use parallel corpora where the source language contains zero pronouns and the target language does not. This helps the model learn the implicit references in the source language and translate them correctly into the target language.

4. **Contextual Information**: Incorporate additional contextual information in the training data. For example, include surrounding sentences or paragraphs to provide more context for resolving zero pronouns.

5. **Preprocessing Techniques**: Apply preprocessing techniques to identify and mark zero pronouns in the source text before feeding it into the model. This can involve linguistic rules or machine learning models trained to detect zero pronouns.

The results show that this can really improve the translation quality, even though the automatic prediction of EC is not highly accurate. Besides, Wang et al. (2016aWang et al. ( ,b, 2017b proposed to integrate neural-based ZP recovery with SMT systems, showing better performance on both ZP recovery and overall translation. When entering the era of NMT, ZP recovery is also employed as an external system. Assuming that no-pro-drop languages can benefit pro-drop ones, Ohtani et al. (2019) tagged the coreference information in the source language, and then encoded it using a graph-based encoder integrated with NMT model. Tan et al. (2019) recovered ZP in the source sentence via a BiLSTM-CRF model (Lample et al., 2016). Different from the conventional ZP recovery methods, the label is the corresponding translation of ZP around with special tokens. They then trained a NMT model on this modified data, letting the model learn the copy behaviors. Tan et al. (2021) used ZP detector to predict the ZP position and inserted a special token. Second, they used a attention-based ZP recovery model to recover the ZP word on the corresponding ZP position.

End-to-End Due the lack of training data on ZPT, a couple of studies pay attention to data augmentation. Sugiyama and Yoshinaga (2019) employed the back-translation on a context-aware NMT model to augment the training data. With the help of context, the pronoun in no-pronoun-drop language can be translated correctly into pronoundrop language. They also build a contrastive dataset to filter the pseudo data. Besides, Kimura et al.

(2019) investigated the selective standards in detail to filter the pseudo data. Ri et al. (2021) deleted the personal pronoun in the sentence to augment the training data. And they trained a classifier to keep the sentences that pronouns can be recovered without any context. About model architecture, Wang et al. (2018a) first proposed a reconstruction-based approach to reconstruct the ZP-annotated source sentence from the hidden states of either encoder or decoder, or both. The central idea behind is to guide the corresponding hidden states to embed the recalled source-side ZP information and subsequently to help the NMT model generate the missing pronouns with these enhanced hidden representations. Although this model achieved significant improvements, there nonetheless exist two drawbacks: 1) there is no interaction between the two separate reconstructors, which misses the opportunity to exploit useful relations between encoder and decoder representations; and 2) testing phase needs an external ZP prediction model and it only has an accuracy of 66% in F1-score, which propagates numerous errors to the translation model. Thus, Wang et al. (2018b) further proposed to improve the reconstruction-based model by using shared reconstructor and joint learning. Furthermore, relying on external ZP models in decoding makes these approaches unwieldy in practice, due to introducing more computation cost and complexity.

About learning objective, contrastive learning is often used to let the output more close to golden data while far away from negative samples. Yang et al. (2019b) proposed a contrastive learning to reduce the word omitted error. To construct the negative samples, they randomly dropped the word by considering its frequency or part-of-speech tag. Hwang et al. (2021) further considered the coreference information to construct the negative sample. According to the coreference information, they took place the antecedent in context with empty, mask or random token to get the negative samples. Besides, Jwalapuram et al. (2020) served the pronoun mistranslated output as the negative samples while golden sentences as positive sample. To get the negative samples, they aligned the word between model outputs and golden references to get the sentences with mistranslated pronoun.

Implicit Some works consider not just the ZPT issue but rather focus on the overall discourse problem. The document-level NMT models (Wang et al., 2017a;Werlen et al., 2018;Ma et al., 2020;Lopes et al., 2020) are expected to have strong capabilities in discourse modelling such as translation consistency and ZPT. Another method is the round-trip translation, which is commonly-used in automatic post-editing (APE) (Freitag et al., 2019), quality estimation (QE) (Moon et al., 2020) to correct of detect the translation errors. Voita et al. (2019) served this idea on context-aware NMT to correct the discourse error in the output. They employed the round-trip translation on monolingual data to get the parallel corpus in the target language. They then used the corpus to train a model to repair discourse phenomenon in MT output.  proposed a fully unified ZPT model, which absolutely released the reliance on external ZP models at decoding time.

What are the main approaches to zero pronoun translation in neural machine translation?

Answer:

None","The main approaches to zero pronoun translation in neural machine translation (NMT) include:

1. **Data Augmentation**: This involves creating synthetic training data where zero pronouns are explicitly added or annotated. This helps the NMT model learn to handle sentences with zero pronouns by providing more examples during training.

2. **Context-Aware Models**: These models incorporate additional context beyond the sentence level, such as preceding and following sentences, to better understand and translate zero pronouns. This can be achieved through techniques like using larger context windows or employing hierarchical models that process multiple sentences together.

3. **Explicit Pronoun Prediction**: This approach involves first predicting the zero pronouns explicitly before translating the sentence. A separate model or a component within the NMT system is trained to identify and insert the appropriate pronouns based on the context.

4. **Multi-Task Learning**: In this approach, the NMT model is trained on multiple related tasks simultaneously, such as translation and pronoun resolution. By sharing representations and learning jointly, the model can improve its ability to handle zero pronouns.

5. **Pre-trained Language Models**: Leveraging pre-trained language models like BERT or GPT, which have been trained on large corpora and have a better understanding of context and pronoun usage, can enhance the NMT system's ability to translate zero pronouns accurately.

6. **Attention Mechanisms**: Enhanced attention mechanisms that focus on relevant parts of the context can help the model better understand the antecedents of zero pronouns and translate them appropriately.

These approaches aim to address the challenge of zero pronouns, which are pronouns that are implied but not explicitly stated in the source language, making their translation into target languages with explicit pronoun requirements more accurate.",What are the primary methods used in neural machine translation to handle the translation of zero pronouns?,What are the main approaches to handling zero pronouns in neural machine translation?,,"Questions:

Answer:

Researchers have explored various methods for obtaining positive samples for unsupervised sentence representations.

One approach involves using other spans of text that either overlap with the given span or come from the same document (Giorgi et al., 2021).

Another strategy is to use related entities as positives instead of text spans (Nishikawa et al., 2022).","To obtain positive samples for unsupervised sentence representations, several methods can be employed. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Data Augmentation**: This involves creating variations of the same sentence by applying transformations such as synonym replacement, back-translation, or paraphrasing. These variations are considered positive samples as they convey the same meaning as the original sentence.

2. **Contextual Similarity**: Sentences that appear in similar contexts within a large corpus can be treated as positive samples. For example, sentences that occur in the same paragraph or document are likely to be semantically related.

3. **Contrastive Learning**: In this method, positive samples are generated by slightly modifying the original sentence while keeping its meaning intact. Techniques like dropout masking, token shuffling, or adding noise can be used to create these variations.

4. **Cross-lingual Alignment**: Sentences that are translations of each other in different languages can serve as positive samples. This leverages the semantic equivalence across languages to improve sentence representations.

5. **Sentence Embedding Models**: Pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, or Sentence-BERT can be used to generate embeddings for sentences. Sentences with similar embeddings can be considered positive samples due to their semantic closeness.

6. **Clustering**: By clustering sentences based on their semantic similarity, sentences within the same cluster can be treated as positive samples. This method assumes that sentences in the same cluster share similar meanings.

These methods help in creating pairs or groups of sentences that are semantically similar, which are crucial for training models to learn effective sentence representations in an unsupervised manner.",What are some methods researchers have explored for obtaining positive samples for unsupervised sentence representations?,What are some methods researchers have explored for obtaining positive samples for unsupervised sentence representations?,"Researchers have explored various methods for obtaining positive samples for unsupervised sentence representations.

Recent studies, such as Gao et al.

Specifically, dropout randomly deactivates a subset of neurons in the neural network during training, which results in slightly different representations each time the same sentence is processed. These different representations are then treated as positive pairs in the contrastive learning framework. The goal is to make the representations of these augmented versions (created by dropout) similar to each other while distinguishing them from representations of other sentences. This helps the model learn more robust and generalized sentence embeddings.","How does dropout function as an augmentation strategy in contrastive learning for sentence representations, and what is its impact on the training process?",How is dropout used as an augmentation strategy in contrastive learning for sentence representations during training?,"Dropout is used during training to randomly deactivate some neurons in the layer, resulting in slightly different representations when the same training instance is passed through the model multiple times.

Alternative Loss and Objectives##
In § 2, we discuss Contrastive loss, which is widely used in machine learning. However, this loss suffers from several limitations: for instance it only considers binary relationships between instances, lacks a mechanism to incorporate ""hard negatives"". To overcome these drawbacks, researchers have explored supplementary losses that can be used in conjunction with the Contrastive loss. Moreover, they have proposed alterations to the loss function that make it more effective for learning, as well as alternative loss functions for contrastive learning of sentence representations. This section provides an overview of these approaches.

To improve the learning of sentence representations using the Contrastive loss, researchers have introduced several supplementary losses. These include: (1) the hinge loss proposed by Jiang et al. (2022b), which enhances discrimination between positive and negative pairs; (2) losses suggested by Wu et al. (2022b) for reconstructing the original sentence from its representation to better capture sentence semantics; (3) a loss developed by Chuang et al. (2022) to identify masked words and improve sensitivity to meaningless semantic transformations; and (4) a loss proposed by Chen et al. (2022a) to minimize redundant information from transformations by minimizing information entropy.

Besides such supplementary losses, some studies have suggested modifications to the original contrastive loss for better effectiveness. For instance, Wu et al. (2022c) have proposed an additional term that incorporates random noise from a Gaussian distribution as negative instances. In the same vein, Zhang et al.

In the same vein, Zhang et al. (2022d) have introduced two losses—the angular loss and margin-based triplet loss—to better address the intricacies of similarity between pairs of examples.","To improve the Contrastive loss for sentence representations, several supplementary losses and modifications have been proposed. Some of these include:

1. **Triplet Loss**: This loss function considers three samples: an anchor, a positive sample (similar to the anchor), and a negative sample (dissimilar to the anchor). The goal is to ensure that the anchor is closer to the positive sample than to the negative sample by a specified margin.

2. **Margin Ranking Loss**: This loss function is used to learn a ranking function that orders pairs of samples correctly. It encourages the model to rank a positive sample higher than a negative sample by a certain margin.

3. **Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss**: This loss function extends the contrastive loss by considering multiple negative samples for each positive pair, which can help in better distinguishing between similar and dissimilar pairs.

4. **Hard Negative Mining**: This technique involves selecting the most challenging negative samples (those that are closest to the anchor) during training. This can make the model more robust by focusing on difficult cases.

5. **Cross-Entropy Loss**: In some cases, cross-entropy loss is used in conjunction with contrastive loss to improve the quality of sentence representations by providing a probabilistic framework for classification tasks.

6. **Center Loss**: This loss function aims to minimize the distance between features and their corresponding class centers, which can help in creating more discriminative features.

7. **Self-Supervised Learning Objectives**: Techniques like masked language modeling (MLM) or next sentence prediction (NSP) can be combined with contrastive loss to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data for pre-training sentence representations.

8. **Data Augmentation**: Applying data augmentation techniques such as back-translation, synonym replacement, or random cropping can help in generating more diverse training samples, which can improve the robustness of the learned representations.

9. **Temperature Scaling**: Adjusting the temperature parameter in the contrastive loss can control the smoothness of the probability distribution, which can help in better distinguishing between positive and negative samples.

10. **Regularization Techniques**: Adding regularization terms such as L2 regularization or dropout can help in preventing overfitting and improving the generalization of the model.

(2021) examine the relationships between 43 diverse stateof-the-art neural network models (including embedding models, recurrent models, and transformers) across three datasets (two fMRI, one electrocardiography). They rely on a metric they term Brain Score which involves normalising the Pearson correlation by a noise ceiling. Their results show that transformer-based models perform better than recurrent or static models, and larger models perform better than smaller ones.

Similarly, in , the Schoffelen et al. (2019) fMRI and MEG datasets are used to compare a variety of transformer architectures. They study how architectural details, training settings, and the linguistic performance of these models independently account for the generation of brain correspondent representations. The results suggest that the better language models are at predicting words from context, the better their activations linearly map onto those of the brain. Antonello et al. (2021) evaluate three static and five attention-based transformer models, in combination with four fine-tuning tasks and two machine translation models. They train linear regression models to evaluate their word-level representations against a new fMRI dataset from participants listening to podcast stories. They find a low-dimensional structure in language representations that can predict brain responses. In a similar setting, Antonello and Huth (2022) examine why some features fit the brain data better arguing that the reason is that they capture various linguistic phenomena.

Reddy and Wehbe (2021) evaluate syntactic features in conjunction with BERT representations, finding that syntax explains additional variance in brain activity in various parts of the language system, even while controlling for complexity metrics that capture processing load.

In a series of studies Caucheteux et al. (2021Caucheteux et al. ( , 2022b investigate GPT2's activations in predicting brain signals using the Nastase et al. (2021) dataset. Their evaluation metric is Brain Score (Schrimpf et al., 2018). To determine which factors affect the brain encoding Pasquiou et al. (2022) examine the impact of test loss, training corpus, model architecture, and fine-tuning in various models using the Li et al. (2022) dataset. They evaluate model performance using Pearson Correlation.

Oota et al. (2022a) study the impact of context size in language models on how they align with neural response measurements. They use the Nastase et al. (2021) dataset and evaluate recurrent and attention-based transformer architectures. In a later study, Oota et al. (2022b) use the Pereira et al. (2018) dataset and evaluate BERTbase models (fine-tuned for various NLP tasks). They showed that neural response predictions from ridge regression with BERT-base models fine-tuned for coreference resolution, NER, and shallow syntactic parsing explained more variance for Pereira et al. (2018) response measurements. On the other hand, tasks such as paraphrase generation, summarization, and natural language inference led to better encoding performance for the Nastase et al. (2021) data (audio). Using the same dataset, in Oota et al. (2022c) it is shown that the presence of surface, syntactic, and semantic linguistic information is crucial for the alignment across all layers of the language model. They use pairwise matching accuracy and/or Pearson correlation as their performance metrics in these studies.

Aw and Toneva (2023) extract feature representations from four attention-based transformer models. They evaluate the impact of fine-tuning on the BookSum dataset (Kryscinski et al., 2021). All models are used to predict brain activity on the Harry Potter data. Pairwise matching accuracy and Pearson correlation are their performance metrics. Merlin and Toneva (2022) focus more narrowly on variants of GPT-2, showing that improvements in alignment with brain recordings are probably not because of the next-word prediction task or wordlevel semantics, but due to multi-word semantics. Their reported metric is Pearson correlation.

Intermediate summary The above studies differ in many respects. Several metrics are used: pairwise-matching accuracy, 2 Pearson correlation (or Brain Score), mean squared error, and representational similarity analysis. Even studies that report the same performance metrics are not directly comparable because they often report on results on different datasets and use slightly different protocols, e.g., Murphy et al. (2012) and Wehbe et al. (2014b). Beinborn et al. (2023) compare various encoding experiments and receive very diverse results for different evaluation metrics. The diversity of metrics and data renders a direct comparison difficult. To remedy this, we consider how the metrics compare in §6.","(p1.0) To infer a mapping between language models and brains, researchers rely on datasets in which brain activity is recorded in response to linguistic stimuli. In some studies, the stimuli are single words (Mitchell et al., 2008;Anderson et al., 2017) or sentences displayed on a screen (Pereira et al., 2018). In others, participants read longer stories (Wehbe et al., 2014a;Bhattasali et al., 2020;Nastase et al., 2021) or listened to speech or podcasts (Huth et al., 2016;Antonello et al., 2021). Table 1 lists publicly available datasets that have been used in the context of mapping language models to and from recordings of brain response. Differences between the datasets -the number of participants, the equipment, the experimental setup, pre-processing steps, and probabilistic corrections -should lead us to expect some variation in what researchers have concluded (Hollenstein et al., 2020).

(p1.1) 3 How to predict brain activity?

(p1.2) In this section, we survey work in which neural responses are predicted from linguistic representations. Such work typically aims to shed light on how language functions in the brain. One of the earliest studies exploring the mapping between brain and language representations is by Mitchell et al. (2008), who trained a linear regression model on a set of word representations extracted from 60 nouns using 115 semantic features based on cooccurrence statistics, to predict the corresponding fMRI representations of the same nouns. They use pair-wise matching accuracy evaluation, extracting two words w and w ′ for evaluation, and showed that the predicted fMRI for a word w was closer to the real fMRI image for w than to the real fMRI image for w ′ , at above-chance levels. Mitchell et al. (2008) also report percentile rank results, ranking predicted fMRI images by similarity with the real image of w. We discuss how the metrics relate in §6.

(p1.3) The dataset of Mitchell et al. (2008)is also used by Murphy et al. (2012), who extract linguistic features from part-of-speech taggers, stemmers, and dependency parsers, showing that dependency parsers are the most successful in predicting brain activity. They also use leave-2-out pair-matching as their performance metric.

(p1.4) Later on, Wehbe et al. (2014a) moved on to predicting brain activation patterns for entire sentences rather than for isolated words. They recorded fMRI neural response measurements while participants read a chapter from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, then extracted a set of 195 features for each word (ranging from semantic, syntactic properties to visual and discourse-level features) to train a comprehensive generative model that would then predict the time series of the fMRI activity observed when the participants read that passage. Leave-2-out pair-matching accuracy is used for evaluation. Huth et al. (2016), in contrast, use fMRI recordings of participants listening to spoken narrative stories, representing each word in the corpus as a 985-dimensional vector encoding semantic information driven by co-occurrence statistics. They train per-voxel linear regression models and evaluate their predicted per-word fMRI images by their per-voxel Pearson correlation with the real fMRI images, showing that 3-4 dimensions explained a significant amount of variance in the FMRI data. Wehbe et al. (2014b) are among the first to use neural language models, using recurrent models to compute contextualized embeddings, hidden state vectors of previous words, and word probabilities.  of participants reading Harry Potter, obtained in a follow-up study to Wehbe et al. (2014a). From the three sets of representations, they then train linear regression models to predict the MEG vectors corresponding to each word, and the regression models are then evaluated by computing pair-matching accuracy.

(p1.5) Similarly, Søgaard (2016) evaluates static word embeddings on the data from Wehbe et al. (2014a), learning linear transformation from word embeddings into an fMRI vector space. The predictions are evaluated through mean squared error (MSE).

(p1.6) Jain and Huth (2018) evaluate recurrent language models against the fMRI dataset from Huth et al. (2016). Their findings show that contextual language model representations align significantly better (to brain response) compared to static word embedding models. Their evaluation metric is the total sum of explained variance 1 Following this, Schwartz et al. (2019) use attention-based transformer language models for brain mapping. They finetune BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)to predict neural response measurements from the Harry Potter dataset, showing that the fine-tuned models have representations that encode more brain-activity-relevant language information than the non-finetuned models. They rely on pair-matching accuracy as their performance metric.

(p1.7) As in Søgaard (2016), Zhang et al. (2020) map static word embeddings into the vector space of the neural response measurements (fMRI). They introduce a new dataset of such measurements from subjects listening to natural stories. They rely on explained variance as their performance metric.

(p1.8) Toneva and Wehbe (2019) evaluate word and sequence embeddings from 4 recurrent and attention-based transformer language models, using the Harry Potter fMRI dataset. They evaluate models across layers, context lengths, and attention types, using pairwise matching accuracy as their performance metric. In a later study, Toneva et al. (2022a) induce compositional semantic representations of ""supra-word meaning"" which they then use to predict neural responses across regions of interest, evaluating their models using Pearson correlation.

(p1.9) Also using the Harry Potter data,  evaluate five models, one static and four contextualized, relying on a variant of representational similarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008). The results suggest that models provide representations of local contexts that are well-aligned to neural measurements. However, as information from further away context is integrated by the models, representations become less aligned to neural measurements.

(2021) examine the relationships between 43 diverse stateof-the-art neural network models (including embedding models, recurrent models, and transformers) across three datasets (two fMRI, one electrocardiography). They rely on a metric they term Brain Score which involves normalising the Pearson correlation by a noise ceiling. Their results show that transformer-based models perform better than recurrent or static models, and larger models perform better than smaller ones.

Similarly, in , the Schoffelen et al. (2019) fMRI and MEG datasets are used to compare a variety of transformer architectures. They study how architectural details, training settings, and the linguistic performance of these models independently account for the generation of brain correspondent representations. The results suggest that the better language models are at predicting words from context, the better their activations linearly map onto those of the brain. Antonello et al. (2021) evaluate three static and five attention-based transformer models, in combination with four fine-tuning tasks and two machine translation models. They train linear regression models to evaluate their word-level representations against a new fMRI dataset from participants listening to podcast stories. They find a low-dimensional structure in language representations that can predict brain responses. In a similar setting, Antonello and Huth (2022) examine why some features fit the brain data better arguing that the reason is that they capture various linguistic phenomena.

Reddy and Wehbe (2021) evaluate syntactic features in conjunction with BERT representations, finding that syntax explains additional variance in brain activity in various parts of the language system, even while controlling for complexity metrics that capture processing load.

In a series of studies Caucheteux et al. (2021Caucheteux et al. ( , 2022b investigate GPT2's activations in predicting brain signals using the Nastase et al. (2021) dataset. Their evaluation metric is Brain Score (Schrimpf et al., 2018). To determine which factors affect the brain encoding Pasquiou et al. (2022) examine the impact of test loss, training corpus, model architecture, and fine-tuning in various models using the Li et al. (2022) dataset. They evaluate model performance using Pearson Correlation.

Oota et al. (2022a) study the impact of context size in language models on how they align with neural response measurements. They use the Nastase et al. (2021) dataset and evaluate recurrent and attention-based transformer architectures. In a later study, Oota et al. (2022b) use the Pereira et al. (2018) dataset and evaluate BERTbase models (fine-tuned for various NLP tasks). They showed that neural response predictions from ridge regression with BERT-base models fine-tuned for coreference resolution, NER, and shallow syntactic parsing explained more variance for Pereira et al. (2018) response measurements. On the other hand, tasks such as paraphrase generation, summarization, and natural language inference led to better encoding performance for the Nastase et al. (2021) data (audio). Using the same dataset, in Oota et al. (2022c) it is shown that the presence of surface, syntactic, and semantic linguistic information is crucial for the alignment across all layers of the language model. They use pairwise matching accuracy and/or Pearson correlation as their performance metrics in these studies.

Aw and Toneva (2023) extract feature representations from four attention-based transformer models. They evaluate the impact of fine-tuning on the BookSum dataset (Kryscinski et al., 2021). All models are used to predict brain activity on the Harry Potter data. Pairwise matching accuracy and Pearson correlation are their performance metrics. Merlin and Toneva (2022) focus more narrowly on variants of GPT-2, showing that improvements in alignment with brain recordings are probably not because of the next-word prediction task or wordlevel semantics, but due to multi-word semantics. Their reported metric is Pearson correlation.

Intermediate summary The above studies differ in many respects. Several metrics are used: pairwise-matching accuracy, 2 Pearson correlation (or Brain Score), mean squared error, and representational similarity analysis. Even studies that report the same performance metrics are not directly comparable because they often report on results on different datasets and use slightly different protocols, e.g., Murphy et al. (2012) and Wehbe et al. (2014b). Beinborn et al. (2023) compare various encoding experiments and receive very diverse results for different evaluation metrics. The diversity of metrics and data renders a direct comparison difficult. To remedy this, we consider how the metrics compare in §6.",False,"

sent6: 3 How to predict brain activity?
sent7: In this section, we survey work in which neural responses are predicted from linguistic representations.
sent8: Such work typically aims to shed light on how language functions in the brain.
sent9: One of the earliest studies exploring the mapping between brain and language representations is by Mitchell et al. (2008), who trained a linear regression model on a set of word representations extracted from 60 nouns using 115 semantic features based on cooccurrence statistics, to predict the corresponding fMRI representations of the same nouns.
sent10: They use pair-wise matching accuracy evaluation, extracting two words w and w ′ for evaluation, and showed that the predicted fMRI for a word w was closer to the real fMRI image for w than to the real fMRI image for w ′ , at above-chance levels.
sent11: Mitchell et al. (2008) also report percentile rank results, ranking predicted fMRI images by similarity with the real image of w. We discuss how the metrics relate in §6.
sent12: The dataset of Mitchell et al. (2008)is also used by Murphy et al. (2012), who extract linguistic features from part-of-speech taggers, stemmers, and dependency parsers, showing that dependency parsers are the most successful in predicting brain activity.
sent13: They also use leave-2-out pair-matching as their performance metric.Later on, Wehbe et al. (2014a) moved on to predicting brain activation patterns for entire sentences rather than for isolated words.
sent14: They recorded fMRI neural response measurements while participants read a chapter from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, then extracted a set of 195 features for each word (ranging from semantic, syntactic properties to visual and discourse-level features) to train a comprehensive generative model that would then predict the time series of the fMRI activity observed when the participants read that passage.
sent15: Leave-2-out pair-matching accuracy is used for evaluation.
sent16: Huth et al. (2016), in contrast, use fMRI recordings of participants listening to spoken narrative stories, representing each word in the corpus as a 985-dimensional vector encoding semantic information driven by co-occurrence statistics.
sent17: They train per-voxel linear regression models and evaluate their predicted per-word fMRI images by their per-voxel Pearson correlation with the real fMRI images, showing that 3-4 dimensions explained a significant amount of variance in the FMRI data.
sent18: Wehbe et al. (2014b) are among the first to use neural language models, using recurrent models to compute contextualized embeddings, hidden state vectors of previous words, and word probabilities.
sent19: of participants reading Harry Potter, obtained in a follow-up study to Wehbe et al. (2014a).
sent20: From the three sets of representations, they then train linear regression models to predict the MEG vectors corresponding to each word, and the regression models are then evaluated by computing pair-matching accuracy.
sent21: Similarly, Søgaard (2016) evaluates static word embeddings on the data from Wehbe et al. (2014a), learning linear transformation from word embeddings into an fMRI vector space.
sent22: The predictions are evaluated through mean squared error (MSE).
sent23: Jain and Huth (2018) evaluate recurrent language models against the fMRI dataset from Huth et al. (2016).
sent24: Their findings show that contextual language model representations align significantly better (to brain response) compared to static word embedding models.
sent25: Their evaluation metric is the total sum of explained variance 1
sent26: Following this, Schwartz et al. (2019) use attention-based transformer language models for brain mapping.
sent27: They finetune BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)to predict neural response measurements from the Harry Potter dataset, showing that the fine-tuned models have representations that encode more brain-activity-relevant language information than the non-finetuned models.
sent28: They rely on pair-matching accuracy as their performance metric.
sent29: As in Søgaard (2016), Zhang et al. (2020) map static word embeddings into the vector space of the neural response measurements (fMRI).
sent30: They introduce a new dataset of such measurements from subjects listening to natural stories.
sent31: They rely on explained variance as their performance metric.
sent32: Toneva and Wehbe (2019) evaluate word and sequence embeddings from 4 recurrent and attention-based transformer language models, using the Harry Potter fMRI dataset.
sent33: They evaluate models across layers, context lengths, and attention types, using pairwise matching accuracy as their performance metric.
sent34: In a later study, Toneva et al. (2022a) induce compositional semantic representations of ""supra-word meaning"" which they then use to predict neural responses across regions of interest, evaluating their models using Pearson correlation.
sent35: Also using the Harry Potter data,  evaluate five models, one static and four contextualized, relying on a variant of representational similarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008).
sent36: The results suggest that models provide representations of local contexts that are well-aligned to neural measurements.
sent37: However, as information from further away context is integrated by the models, representations become less aligned to neural measurements.
sent38: In a large-scale study, Schrimpf et al. (2021) examine the relationships between 43 diverse stateof-the-art neural network models (including embedding models, recurrent models, and transformers) across three datasets (two fMRI, one electrocardiography).
sent39: They rely on a metric they term Brain Score which involves normalising the Pearson correlation by a noise ceiling.
sent40: Their results show that transformer-based models perform better than recurrent or static models, and larger models perform better than smaller ones.

sent42: They study how architectural details, training settings, and the linguistic performance of these models independently account for the generation of brain correspondent representations.

Several metrics are used: pairwise-matching accuracy, Pearson correlation, percentile rank, cosine distance, precision@k, and representational similarity analysis.","To evaluate decoding models that predict linguistic features from brain responses, several methods are commonly used:

1. **Cross-Validation**: This involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets multiple times to ensure that the model's performance is consistent and not dependent on a particular split of the data. Common techniques include k-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation.

2. **Accuracy Metrics**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to quantify the model's performance. These metrics help in understanding how well the model is predicting the linguistic features from brain responses.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: The correlation between the predicted linguistic features and the actual features can be computed. High correlation values indicate that the model is effectively capturing the relationship between brain responses and linguistic features.

4. **Confusion Matrix**: This is used to visualize the performance of the classification model, showing the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It helps in identifying specific areas where the model may be making errors.

5. **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC)**: These are used to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, and the AUC provides a single value to summarize the overall performance.

6. **Permutation Testing**: This involves randomly shuffling the labels of the data and training the model multiple times to create a distribution of performance metrics under the null hypothesis. This helps in assessing the statistical significance of the model's performance.

7. **Model Comparison**: Comparing the performance of the decoding model with baseline models (e.g., random guessing, majority class prediction) to ensure that the model is providing a meaningful improvement over simple heuristics.

8. **Visualization Techniques**: Techniques such as heatmaps, brain maps, and activation patterns can be used to visualize how the model's predictions correspond to different brain regions and linguistic features.

By employing these methods, researchers can robustly evaluate the effectiveness of decoding models in predicting linguistic features from brain responses.",What methods are used to evaluate decoding models that predict linguistic features from brain responses using static word embeddings?,What specific metrics and techniques are used to evaluate decoding models that predict linguistic features from brain responses?,"Decoding models that predict linguistic features from brain responses are evaluated using a variety of metrics and techniques:

1. **Pairwise Matching Accuracy**: Used to evaluate how well the model can match pairs of stimuli and brain responses.
2. **Percentile Rank**: Adapted to the decoding scenario to assess the model's performance.
3. **Mean Squared Error**: Used by Gauthier and Levy (2019) to evaluate regression models.
4. **Cosine Distance**: Employed by Minnema and Herbelot (2019) to compare decoder models.
5. **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Another metric used by Minnema and Herbelot (2019).
6. **Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)**: Used to compare the similarity of representations.
7. **Pearson Correlation**: Used by Abdou et al. (2021) to measure the alignment between language models and brain activity.
8. **Precision@k**: Used by Zou et al. (2022) and Pascual et al. (2022) to evaluate the accuracy of the top-k predictions.

These metrics are applied across various datasets, including those from Pereira et al. (2018), Wehbe et al. (2014a), and Mitchell et al. (2008). The choice of metric can significantly impact the reported performance, with pairwise matching accuracy noted as potentially less conservative and less reliable compared to other metrics.","Questions:

What specific metrics and techniques are used to evaluate decoding models that predict linguistic features from brain responses?

Answer:

Decoding models that predict linguistic features from brain responses are evaluated using a variety of metrics and techniques:

1. **Pairwise Matching Accuracy**: Used to evaluate how well the model can match pairs of stimuli and brain responses.
2. **Percentile Rank**: Adapted to the decoding scenario to assess the model's performance.
3. **Mean Squared Error**: Used by Gauthier and Levy (2019) to evaluate regression models.
4. **Cosine Distance**: Employed by Minnema and Herbelot (2019) to compare decoder models.
5. **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Another metric used by Minnema and Herbelot (2019).
6. **Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)**: Used to compare the similarity of representations.
7. **Pearson Correlation**: Used by Abdou et al. (2021) to measure the alignment between language models and brain activity.
8. **Precision@k**: Used by Zou et al. (2022) and Pascual et al. (2022) to evaluate the accuracy of the top-k predictions.

These metrics are applied across various datasets, including those from Pereira et al. (2018), Wehbe et al. (2014a), and Mitchell et al. (2008). The choice of metric can significantly impact the reported performance, with pairwise matching accuracy noted as potentially less conservative and less reliable compared to other metrics.","Static word embeddings are evaluated by applying ridge regression to predict per-word fMRI vectors.

The model is evaluated in terms of pairwise matching accuracy and percentile rank, adapted to the decoding scenario.

The regression models are evaluated using two metrics: mean squared error and average percentile rank.

Minnema and Herbelot (2019) re-examine the work of Pereira et al. (2018) using various metrics, including pairwise matching accuracy, percentile rank, cosine distance, R², and RSA, comparing decoder models such as ridge regression, perceptron, and convolutional neural networks.

Their results, obtained using Pearson correlation as a performance metric, are positive for two out of three formalisms.

They evaluate models using precision@k.

They use the Pereira et al. (2018) dataset and evaluate the regression models based on pairwise accuracy and precision@k (or top-k accuracy).

Several metrics are used: pairwise-matching accuracy, Pearson correlation, percentile rank, cosine distance, precision@k, and representational similarity analysis.","sent1: Decoding models work in the other direction and aim to predict linguistic features of the stimuli from recordings of brain response.
sent2: Pereira et al. (2018) introduce a decoder that predicts stimuli representation of semantic features given fMRI data.
sent3: They introduce a novel dataset of neural responses aligned with annotation of concrete and abstract semantic categories (such as pleasure, ignorance, cooking etc.).
sent4: They evaluate static word embeddings by applying ridge regression to predict per-word fMRI vectors.
sent5: A separate regression model is trained per dimension, allowing for dimension-wise regularization.
sent6: The model is evaluated in terms of pairwise matching accuracy, but also in terms of percentile rank, adapted to the decoding scenario.
sent7: Gauthier and Levy (2019) also train linear regression models which map from the response measurements in Pereira et al. (2018), but to representations of the same sentences produced by the BERT language model finetuned on different natural language understanding tasks.
sent8: The regression models are evaluated using two metrics: mean squared error and average percentile rank.
sent9: Their results show that fine-tuning with different NLU objectives leads to worse alignment and that, somewhat surprisingly, the only objective which does lead to better alignment is a scrambled language modeling task where the model is trained to predict scrambled sentences.
sent10: Minnema and Herbelot (2019) re-examine the work of Pereira et al. (2018) using various metrics (pairwise matching accuracy, percentile rank, cosine distance, R 2 , RSA), comparing decoder models (ridge regression, perceptron, and convolutional neural networks). 3
sent11: They show that positive results are only obtained using pairwise matching accuracy.
sent12: Abdou et al. (2021) investigate whether aligning language models with brain recordings can be improved by biasing their attention with annotations from syntactic or semantic formalisms.
sent13: They fine-tune the BERT models using several syntactosemantic formalisms and evaluate their alignment with brain activity measurements from the Wehbe et al. (2014a) and Pereira et al. (2018) datasets.
sent14: Their results -obtained using Pearson correlation as performance metric -are positive for two in three formalisms.
sent15: Zou et al. (2022) propose a new evaluation method for decoding, a so-called cross-modal cloze task.
sent16: They generate the data for the task from the neural response measures in Mitchell et al. (2008) and Wehbe et al. (2014a).
sent17: The task itself amounts to a cloze task in which the context is prefixed by the fMRI image of the masked word.
sent18: They evaluate models using precision@k.
sent19: Note how this task is considerably easier than linearly mapping from language model representations into fMRI images, and precision@k results therefore cannot be compared to those obtained in other settings.
sent20: Their best precision@1 scores are around 0.3, but only marginally (0.03) better than a unimodal LM.
sent21: Finally, Pascual et al. (2022) try a more realistic setup by predicting language from fMRI scans of subjects not included in the training.
sent22: They use the (Pereira et al., 2018) dataset and evaluate the regression models based on pairwise accuracy and precision@k (or top-k accuracy).
sent23: They propose evaluating with direct classification as a more demanding setup to evaluate and understand current brain decoding models.
sent24: Intermediate summary Decoding studies also differ in many respects.
sent25: Several metrics are used: pairwise-matching accuracy, Pearson correlation, percentile rank, cosine distance, precision@k, and representational similarity analysis; and several datasets are used.
sent26: Gauthier and Ivanova (2018) criticize the evaluation techniques of decoding studies and suggest adopting task and mechanism explicit models.
sent27: It is of particular interest to our study that both Minnema and Herbelot (2019) only report positive results for pairwise matching accuracy compared to other metrics.
sent28: This suggests pairwise matching accuracy is a less conservative metric (and maybe less reliable).","1. (What are decoding models and what do they aim to do?): sent1

Classical candidates for shallow factors influencing alignment include word length, frequency, regularity, and part of speech.

Some authors have presented results suggesting that alignments are driven by syntactic or semantic factors (Abdou et al., 2021; Reddy and Wehbe, 2021; Caucheteux et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020), whereas others have claimed some similarities reflect semantic phenomena (Huth et al., 2016; Caucheteux et al., 2021).

1. **Model Architecture**: The specific architecture of the language model (e.g., transformer-based models like GPT-3) can impact how well its representations align with neural responses.

2. **Training Data**: The quality, diversity, and quantity of the training data used to train the language model can affect the alignment. Models trained on large, diverse datasets are more likely to capture a wide range of linguistic and semantic nuances.

3. **Task Similarity**: The similarity between the tasks the language model was trained on and the tasks used to measure neural responses can influence alignment. Models trained on tasks closely related to the neural tasks are likely to show better alignment.

4. **Representation Level**: The level of representation (e.g., word-level, sentence-level, contextual embeddings) used for comparison can affect alignment. Higher-level, context-aware representations often show better alignment with neural responses.

5. **Neural Measurement Techniques**: The methods used to measure neural responses (e.g., fMRI, EEG, MEG) and the specific brain regions targeted can influence the observed alignment. Different techniques capture different aspects of neural activity.

6. **Individual Differences**: Variability in neural responses across individuals can impact alignment. Factors such as age, language proficiency, and cognitive abilities can introduce variability.

7. **Temporal Dynamics**: The timing of neural responses relative to language processing events can affect alignment. Models that account for temporal dynamics in language processing may show better alignment.

8. **Semantic and Syntactic Complexity**: The complexity of the language stimuli used in experiments can influence alignment. More complex stimuli may require more sophisticated models to capture the corresponding neural responses accurately.

By considering these factors, researchers can better understand and improve the alignment between language model representations and neural responses.","What factors have been identified as influencing the alignment between language model representations and neural responses, and how do these factors relate to model quality and size?","What factors, including model quality and size, influence the alignment between language model representations and neural responses?","There is good evidence that alignment has correlated positively with model quality and model size, suggesting a certain level of convergence as language models improve.

sent16: We have argued that precision@k is more conservative than most other metrics.

What factors influence knowledge retention in pre-trained language models?

Answer:

Large language models are known to perform generally better and hold more knowledge (Brown et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020). However, the model's architecture and pre-training objectives are more decisive for knowledge retention than its size (Li et al., 2022a).

Recency (Chiang et al., 2020) and frequency (Kandpal et al., 2023), i.e., when and how often the data is observed during training, are also essential for knowledge retention.

Larger models and more pre-training data can improve knowledge retention if combined with the right choices for architecture and pre-training objectives. However, scaling might not be sufficient (Kandpal et al., 2023).","Several factors influence knowledge retention in pre-trained language models, including:

1. **Training Data Quality and Quantity**: The diversity, relevance, and volume of the training data significantly impact how much knowledge the model can retain. High-quality, extensive datasets help the model learn a wide range of information.

2. **Model Architecture**: The design of the neural network, including the number of layers, attention mechanisms, and other architectural choices, affects the model's ability to store and retrieve information.

3. **Training Duration and Resources**: The amount of computational resources and time allocated for training can influence how well the model learns and retains knowledge. Longer training with more resources generally leads to better retention.

4. **Fine-Tuning**: Post-training fine-tuning on specific tasks or domains can enhance the model's retention of relevant knowledge while potentially causing some forgetting of less relevant information.

5. **Regularization Techniques**: Methods like dropout, weight decay, and other regularization techniques can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization and retention of knowledge.

6. **Update Mechanisms**: How the model updates its parameters during training, including learning rates and optimization algorithms, can impact knowledge retention.

7. **Memory and Storage Mechanisms**: Some models incorporate explicit memory components or external knowledge bases that can aid in retaining and retrieving information.

8. **Evaluation and Feedback**: Continuous evaluation and feedback during training can help in identifying and correcting areas where the model may be losing knowledge.

Understanding and optimizing these factors can lead to better knowledge retention in pre-trained language models.","What are the key factors that influence knowledge retention in pre-trained language models, particularly in relation to model architecture and pre-training objectives?","What factors influence knowledge retention in pre-trained language models, considering model architecture and pre-training objectives?","Large language models are generally better at holding more knowledge (Brown et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020). However, the architecture and pre-training objectives of the model are more crucial for knowledge retention than its size (Li et al., 2022a).

Additionally, training the model to predict whether original entities in the text have been replaced with other entities is beneficial for fact retrieval (Xiong et al., 2020). A masking strategy that aligns with the downstream task also positively impacts performance (Ye et al., 2021).

The size of the pre-training corpus also plays a role. For encoder-only models, a larger corpus leads to higher knowledge retention (Liu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021), whereas for encoder-decoder models, a larger corpus can negatively affect knowledge retention (Lewis et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021a). The recency and frequency of data observed during training are also critical factors (Chiang et al., 2020; Kandpal et al., 2023).

While larger models and more pre-training data can improve knowledge retention, this improvement is contingent on the right choices of architecture and pre-training objectives.

Hence, editing existing knowledge in PLMs and augmenting them with new knowledge is crucial for their use as knowledge bases (Zini and Awad, 2022).","Adopting pre-trained language models as reliable knowledge bases presents several challenges:

1. **Accuracy and Reliability**: Pre-trained language models can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or misleading information. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information they provide is a significant challenge.

2. **Knowledge Update and Temporal Dynamics**: Language models are typically trained on static datasets and may not reflect the most current information. Updating these models to incorporate new knowledge and changes over time is complex and resource-intensive.

3. **Explainability and Interpretability**: The decision-making process of language models is often opaque, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at specific answers. This lack of transparency can be problematic for verifying the correctness of the information.

4. **Bias and Fairness**: Pre-trained language models can inherit and even amplify biases present in their training data. Addressing these biases to ensure fair and unbiased knowledge representation is a critical challenge.

5. **Contextual Understanding**: While language models are good at generating text based on patterns in the data, they may lack deep contextual understanding, leading to responses that are contextually inappropriate or irrelevant.

6. **Scalability and Efficiency**: Deploying large pre-trained models in real-time applications can be computationally expensive and may require significant resources, impacting scalability and efficiency.

7. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**: The use of language models raises ethical and legal issues, such as the potential for misuse, data privacy concerns, and intellectual property rights related to the training data.

Under these assumptions, transformer encoder-decoders can recognize any recursively enumerable language.","Transformer models, as a type of neural network architecture, have shown remarkable capabilities in processing and generating sequences of data, particularly in natural language processing tasks. However, their ability to recognize formal languages is a topic of ongoing research and discussion.

Formal languages are sets of strings constructed from an alphabet according to specific grammatical rules. They can be classified into different types based on the Chomsky hierarchy:

1. **Regular Languages**: These can be recognized by finite automata.
2. **Context-Free Languages**: These can be recognized by pushdown automata.
3. **Context-Sensitive Languages**: These can be recognized by linear-bounded automata.
4. **Recursively Enumerable Languages**: These can be recognized by Turing machines.

### Capabilities of Transformer Models:

1. **Regular Languages**: Transformer models can recognize regular languages. This is because regular languages can be represented by patterns that can be learned by the attention mechanisms in transformers.

2. **Context-Free Languages**: Transformer models have been shown to recognize certain context-free languages, especially those that can be represented with a limited depth of nested structures. However, their ability to generalize to all context-free languages, especially those requiring deep recursion, is limited by their fixed computational resources and depth.

3. **Context-Sensitive and Recursively Enumerable Languages**: These languages are generally beyond the capabilities of transformer models due to their complexity and the need for potentially unbounded memory and computational steps. While transformers can approximate some patterns within these languages, they cannot fully recognize them in the general case.

### Summary:
Transformer models can recognize regular languages and some context-free languages, particularly those with limited depth of nested structures. However, they struggle with more complex context-free languages and are generally unable to recognize context-sensitive and recursively enumerable languages due to their inherent computational limitations.",What specific formal languages have transformer models been proven to recognize?,What specific formal languages have transformer models been proven to recognize?,"Transformer models have been proven to recognize several specific formal languages:

The fact that PARITY's recognizability is so sensitive to assumptions suggests that it is close to the borderline of what transformer encoders can recognize.","Questions:

What factors affect the ability of transformers to recognize the PARITY language?

Answer:

Softmax attention transformers cannot generate PARITY if all position-wise functions are Lipschitz continuous and generation is defined using the KL divergence criterion (Eq. 5).

Chiang and Cholak (2022) showed that transformer encoders with specific positional encodings can recognize PARITY. They provide two constructions based on Hahn's two assumptions.

The fact that PARITY's recognizability is so sensitive to assumptions suggests that it is close to the borderline of what transformer encoders can recognize.","The ability of transformers to recognize the PARITY language is influenced by several factors:

1. **Model Architecture**: The specific design of the transformer, including the number of layers, attention heads, and the size of the hidden states, can impact its ability to capture the necessary patterns to recognize the PARITY language.

2. **Training Data**: The quality, quantity, and diversity of the training data play a crucial role. Adequate and representative training data can help the transformer learn the patterns required to recognize the PARITY language.

3. **Sequence Length**: The length of the input sequences can affect the model's performance. Transformers have a fixed maximum sequence length they can handle, and longer sequences might require special handling or modifications to the model.

4. **Positional Encoding**: Since transformers do not inherently understand the order of input tokens, positional encoding is used to provide this information. The effectiveness of the positional encoding scheme can influence the model's ability to recognize patterns related to the PARITY language.

5. **Training Regime**: The specifics of the training process, including the learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs, can affect the model's ability to learn the PARITY language.

6. **Regularization Techniques**: Techniques such as dropout, weight decay, and others can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability, which is important for recognizing the PARITY language.

7. **Attention Mechanism**: The way the attention mechanism is implemented and how it captures dependencies between different parts of the input sequence can impact the model's ability to recognize the PARITY language.

8. **Initialization and Optimization**: The initial weights of the model and the optimization algorithm used during training can also affect the model's performance.

In summary, the ability of transformers to recognize the PARITY language is a complex interplay of model architecture, training data, sequence length, positional encoding, training regime, regularization techniques, attention mechanism, and initialization and optimization strategies.",What specific conditions and assumptions affect the ability of transformers to recognize the PARITY language?,What specific factors and assumptions affect the ability of transformers to recognize the PARITY language?,"Sure, here is a refined answer based entirely on the section context:
