Below is a content in a list of itemized sentences. Please rate the legibility of the content.
This metric measures how legible the content is, that is, how free it is from the parsing error.
Some common parsong errors are: distracting footnote, distracting caption of table and figure, meaningless symbols, interrupting texts seem from a table. 
Other parsing errors include: incomplete or truncated sentence, missing citations.
It is not saying that all non-textual elements are bad. The math equations, chemical symbols, etc., are legible as long as they are relevant to the content and are in a right place.
Also, inline citations are expected and should not be seen as a lack of legibility.
bad - Low Legible; has parsing errors, making the content hard to read
good - High Legible; none parsing error at all
Only return the rating, without anything else. You should only rate as bad if you are confident that the content is hard to read. If you are unsure, rate as good.

Content: 1. To date, more studies were devoted to BERT's knowledge of syntactic rather than semantic phenomena.
2. However, we do have evidence from an MLM probing study that BERT has some knowledge for semantic roles (Ettinger, 2019).
3. BERT is even able to prefer the incorrect fillers for semantic roles that are semantically related to the correct ones, to those that are unrelated (e.g. ""to tip a chef"" should be better than ""to tip a robin"", but worse than ""to tip a waiter"").
4. Tenney et al. (2019b) showed that BERT encodes information about entity types, relations, semantic roles, and proto-roles, since this information can be detected with probing classifiers.
Rating: good

Content: 1. For BERT, Clark et al. (2019) observe that most heads in the same layer show similar self-attention patterns (perhaps related to the fact that the output of all self-attention heads in Distillation Compression Performance Speedup Model Evaluation DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019)
2. ×2.5 90% ×1.6 BERT 6 All GLUE tasks BERT 6 -PKD (Sun et al., 2019a) ×1.6 97% ×1.9 BERT 6 No WNLI, CoLA and STS-B BERT 3 -PKD (Sun et al., 2019a) ×2  a layer is passed through the same MLP), which explains why Michel et al. (2019) were able to reduce most layers to a single head.
3. Depending on the task, some BERT heads/layers are not only useless, but also harmful to the downstream task performance. § 1.Note that BERT here refers to the base model.
