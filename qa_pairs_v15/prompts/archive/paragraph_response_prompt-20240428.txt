You should only refuse to produce a question if you are very confident that the content does not meet the criteria.
Criteria for suitability include:

1. It should offer comprehensive context beyond mere lists of references or topics.
2. It should limit a mass use of mathematical equations, chemical formulas, and similar non-textual elements.
3. The context should maintain coherence and logical connection.

If the content aligns with these criteria, respond with "YES" and create a question in new line.
The quesetion should be answered by the information that summarizes as much of the contents as possible. 
Make the question no longer than 25-30 words.

Otherwise, refuse to produce a question by saying "NO" and provide the analysis in new line.
The analysis should mention the criteria it fails to meet with a brief explanation. 
Additionally, list any other concerns not covered by these criteria, if applicable.
