Read the given contents and extract the topics mentioned.
If a topic is discussed in depth (that is, can be segmented into at least three second-level bullet-point), summarize the general viewpoints.
If a topic has no deep discussion (has less than three second-level bullet-point), skip it.
If a topic has no deep discussion (has less than three second-level bullet-point), skip it.
If a topic has no deep discussion (has less than three second-level bullet-point), skip it.
If you don’t fine any deep topic, only reply a single word “None”.

Your output should follow a two-hierarchy bullet point format.
The main bullet-point should be a detailed and meaningful expert-level question.
The second-level bullet-points are different sub-viewpoints that can help to answer the main bullet-point.

An example is:

# How to use data activations to discover the role of neurons (corpus-based methods) and why?
  - They establish a connection between a neuron and a concept using co-occurrence between a neuron's activation values and existence of the concept in the underlying input instances
  - Corpus-based methods are global interpretation methods that interpret the role of a neuron over a set of inputs
  - They can be used in combination with the visualization method to reduce the search space for finding the most relevant portions of data that activate a neuron
# What are the different types of the corpus-based methods?
  - Concept Search: methods that take a neuron as input and identify the concept that the neuron has learned
  - Neuron Search: methods that take a concept as input and identify the neurons learning the concept
# How to apply concept search methods to discover the concepts in neurons?
  - Kádár et al. (2017): identified linguistic concepts learned by neurons by extracting top-20, 5-gram contexts for each neuron
  - Na et al. (2019): used lexical concepts of various granularities and extracted top-k activating sentences for each neuron, creating synthetic sentences to highlight a concept
  - Synthetic sentences may lead to identifying neurons exhibiting arbitrary behavior instead of concept-specific behavior
