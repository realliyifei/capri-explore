## INTRODUCTION

Cervical cancer is the 4 th most prevalent among women worldwide and ranks as the 4 th leading cause of cancer-related death with a record of 270,000 deaths persons per year [1]. Various curative efforts developed to treat this disease included radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hysterectomy. Among these existing therapies, radiotherapy emerged as the primary method for managing this condition [2]. Furthermore, it was received by about 40% of women with cervical cancer [3]. Radiotherapy has various side effects, such as diarrhea or radiation-induced diarrhea (RID) which occurs in approximately 80% of patients [2].

RID stems from the changes induced by radiotherapy, which include bacterial flora of the intestine, intestinal motility, and changes in vascular permeability in intestinal mucosal cells [4]. Furthermore, it caused damage to basal epithelial cells and atrophy of surface epithelium, acute cryptitis, crypt abscesses, crypt distortion and atrophy, and stromal inflammation. These effects have the potential to become fibrotic and ultimately increase the risk of strictures and intestinal obstruction. The continuous occurrence of this condition can cause rectal bleeding which will disrupt the process of radiotherapy, as well as the quality of life of patients with cervical cancer [2].

Probiotics are living microorganisms that have beneficial effects when consumed in adequate amounts [5]. They effectively prevent the incidence of RID in cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy [2,[6][7][8]. However, the conclusive stance of its usage as a prevention measure remains uncertain. A study conducted in 2008 stated that there was no difference in RID when probiotics were administered [9]. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of probiotics abstracts against the clinical questions delineated within the PICO framework. A comprehensive review was then performed in full text to ascertain the alignment with the predefined eligibility criteria.

The eligibility criteria consisted of both inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria comprised patients aged above 18 diagnosed with cervical cancer, who have received radiotherapy and probiotics therapy, with the evaluated outcome being preventing diarrhea. Studies falling under the categories of SR/MA of RCT and RCT were considered. Meanwhile, the exclusion criteria encompassed investigations not conducted on human subjects, articles lacking full-text availability, and studies published in languages other than English and Indonesian. The critical appraisal for the selected article was executed employing the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) guidelines, tailored to correspond to the type of therapy study.


## RESULTS


## Article search results

The search conducted on the 4 electronic databases yielded a total of 146 articles. With the aid of the in preventing the incidence of diarrhea among cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.


## METHODS

The literature search was conducted by 2 authors independently across 4 electronic databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and PMC on October 7, 2022. The PICO framework encompassed the following components: Population (patients aged >18 years with cervical cancer undergoing radiotherapy), Intervention (administration of probiotics), and Outcome (preventing diarrhea), which was employed in the process. Following this establishment, the elements were subsequently translated into relevant keywords to facilitate the retrieval of pertinent articles from the databases, as further described in Table 1. Upon obtaining the results of the search, screening for possible duplications was conducted with the help of the Covidence program. In cases where conflict emerged during the assessment, a resolution was sought through consultation with the third author. Subsequently, the identified articles were subjected to a selection process based on a comparative analysis of their titles and   Table 3.

Concerning the aspect of validity, the study selection process was described independently by 2 people. The methodological quality of each report was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomization trials version 2 (RoB 2) as well as the guidelines for Assessing Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). Furthermore, the quality of each study, as indicated by the level of risk, was explained in the Results section. The risk of bias was presented in the form of a funnel plot. The outcomes of each study were presented in tabular form. Finally, there was a forest plot with pooled RR and heterogeneity analysis with I2.

For the importance aspect, each outcome presented in the form of a forest plot with a Relative Risk (RR) value, was assessed. Probiotics proved to have a protective effect to preventing the incidence of RID and the use of the anti-diarrheal drug loperamide, with a p-value <0.05 CI 95%. All evaluated outcomes were statistically significant. Specifically, for the incidence of RID, the RR Covidence program, 34 duplicates were identified and excluded. Furthermore, the screening process was initiated by comparing the title and abstract against the clinical questions outlined in the PICO framework. This led to the identification of 11 articles that proceeded to the next phase of eligibility assessment. During the assessment phase, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted by meticulously reviewing the complete content of each article. As a result, 9 articles were excluded. The reason was that 5 had fewer specific subjects (non-specific cancer types and cancer therapy types including radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and the 4 were RCT studies included in one of the SR/MA articles to be selected. Additionally, 2 selected studies, namely the report conducted by Qiu et al. [4] and Ahren et al. [5] were subjected to further critical review. The process of searching and selecting articles, from screening titles and abstracts to obtaining relevant articles, is summarized in Figure 1

Placebo -Incidence of diarrhea while radiotherapy -Incidence of diarrhea after radiotherapy was 0.61 (CI 95% 0.46-0.81, p=0.0007), and for the use of the antidiarrheal drug loperamide, the RR was 0.43 (CI 95% 0.29-0.64, p<0.0001). However, it is worth noting that these two outcomes still displayed considerable heterogeneity, as indicated by an I2 value of >40%. The results of the study can be applied and there were no major adverse events from the administration of probiotics to preventing diarrhea in cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. In terms of validity, Table 1 showed that differences in age, body weight, BMI, and other characteristics were not significantly different between groups. According to the report, "there are no statistical variations between the probiotics groups and the placebo". The groups were treated differently because probiotics therapy (starting a week before radiotherapy until 2 weeks after radiotherapy) varied for each subject (23-36 days). Therefore, the synchrony of the administration remains uncertain. The variability extended to the therapeutic method received by the patient, which encompassed chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Another key aspect concerning validity was the pronounced drop-out rate (31%) which lacked statistical significance. The attrition emanated from the withdrawal of consent, and 8 data could be used to assess the outcome since daily notes were submitted while participating in the study for the first 14 days. The high dropout rate also reduced the sample size to less than ideal. Finally, the difficulty of getting study subjects was conveyed as a limitation.

For the importance aspect, the absolute risk reduction (ARR) of using probiotics (high-dose probiotics) to reduce the incidence of diarrhea during and after radiotherapy was only 4%. This corresponds to a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) 25 persons to prevent diarrhea incidence.

For the applicability aspect, therapy was provided in the form of feasible probiotics, but the available strains were different from those used in the study. The investigation showed no significant instances of adverse events, hence, affirming the safety of its administration.


## DISCUSSION

Diarrhea holds significant importance within the realm of radiotherapy considerations. Failing to promptly administer suitable treatment for this condition holds the potential to not only compromise the quality of life but also disrupt the continuity of radiotherapy implementation in cervical cancer cases. This could be prevented by the use of probiotics which reduces apoptosis among intestinal epithelial cells thereby helping the recovery of radiationdamaged epithelial cells. Additionally, they also increase the immune system response to pathogens [6]. Upon conducting a critical review of 2 articles about the efficacy of probiotics, it was discovered that this therapy has benefits for preventing diarrhea in cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.

A critical study of the SR/MA conducted by Qiu et al. [4] encompassed a thorough assessment of 3 dimensions, namely validity, importance, and applicability. In terms of validity, the studies under scrutiny exclusively incorporated double-blind RCTs that had been critically assessed following the AMSTAR guidelines. A uniformity was maintained across all subject matters and outcome measures. However, it is pertinent to acknowledge certain limitations within this investigation. The diversity in probiotics interventions introduced variations in the strains administered, contributing to a notable heterogeneity among the studies. The I2 value, ranging from 66% for RID outcomes, underscored this variability. In terms of importance, the administration of probiotics was proven to reduce the incidence of RID in cervical cancer patients with an RR of 0.61 (CI 95% 0.46-0.81) and a p-value of 0.0007. This observed RR was deemed satisfactory for a non-invasive and minimal side-effect therapy. Finally, the applicability aspect encompassed the inclusion of 8 RCTs study with PICO similar to that of the present study. Each RCT in this study used a mixture of different strains, with an average dose of 2-3 times per day starting from the first to the last day of the radiotherapy session. The usage of probiotics containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterial strains given 3x1 sachet daily at the initial stage of receiving radiotherapy had the best benefit in preventing diarrhea. However, the limitation of this study was not explicitly stated.

The RCT study conducted by Ahren et al. [5] was reviewed for the second time. It was discovered that the mean incidence of diarrhea (according to Bristol 6 and 7) was not significantly reduced in the probiotics group. However, the mean days with the condition were significantly decreased. High-dose probiotics (8.65 + 5.93 days) showed a considerable decrease compared to placebo (15.04 + 8.92 days) with a significance level of p=0.014. Furthermore, 3 dimensions namely, validity, importance, and applicability were further highlighted in this RCT study. In terms of validity, the dropout rate was large (30%), such that the number of samples used for analysis was below the ideal sample size, potentially interfering with the result validity. Additionally, the limitations of the study were attributed to discrepancies in treatment between the intervention and the placebo group. This heterogeneity stemmed from variations in the duration of probiotics administration, spanning a range of 23-36 days. A further layer of heterogeneity arose from differences in the study population, characterized by variations in chemotherapy and brachytherapy (radiotherapy) interventions.

In terms of importance, the ARR of using probiotics (HDP) to reduce the incidence of diarrhea during and after radiotherapy was only 4%. The risk ratios (RR) were 0.9 and 0.94, meaning that probiotics had a preventing effect of 10% and 16% during and after radiotherapy. These values are smaller (CI values are not submitted) than those reported by Qiu et al. [4] SR study, where it was 0.61 (CI 95% 0.46-0.81). In terms of applicability, the probiotics strains used in the study were Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9® (LPHEAL9®; DSM 15312) combined with Lactiplantacillus plantarum 299 (Probi® Plantarum 6595; DSM 6595). This particular type was currently unavailable in Indonesia. The prevalent options are Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum, Streptococcus thermophilus (Lacto B), Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (Interlac), and Lactobacillus casei Shirota (Yakult). The unavailability of the studied strains poses challenges for application, specifically considering the lengthy radiotherapy periods and the associated costs. Patients, at the point described in the text (between the second fraction and the 25 th planned fraction of radiotherapy), would require accessible probiotics preparations. Comparing both studies, it was observed that SR/MA by Qiu et al. [4] exhibited a more pronounced effect size. This observation underscores the elevated level of evidence associated with well-executed systematic reviews, rendering their results more applicable in practical settings than singular RCTs. To enhance the utility of Qiu et al. [4] study, a comprehensive reassessment of the probiotics types employed in each constituent RCT would be necessary, considering factors such as price and availability within the hospital's context.

The results of these 2 studies indicated the benefits of probiotics in preventing diarrhea in cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. However, there was no similarity in terms of the strain used, the dose, and when to start the administration. The risk ratio of diarrhea incidence was 0.61 (CI 95% 0.46-0.81, p=0.0007), signifying a lower risk compared to those not receiving probiotics treatment. The SR/MA results serve as a template due to the high level of evidence. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted on the most useful probiotic strains to prevent diarrhea in cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.

The limitation of this study was the inclusion of only 2 articles, which subsequently impacted the conclusiveness of the results. Therefore, the eligibility criteria need to be broadened to accommodate more articles.


## CONCLUSIONS

The risk ratio of diarrhea incidence among cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy while using probiotics was 0.61 (CI 95% 0.46-0.81, p=0.0007). The administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterial strains during the initial stage of radiotherapy, at a dose of 3x1 sachet daily, showed the best benefit in preventing diarrhea. These probiotics can be given based on the locally available strains which should be similar to those used in the study.
