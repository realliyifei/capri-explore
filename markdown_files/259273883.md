five trials included ≤150 participants.Small sample sizes often resulted in imbalanced groups (e.g., comorbidities, number of potentially inappropriate medications), yet no trials presented multivariable analyses.In the two trials with the most weight in the meta-analysis, several deaths occurred before the intervention, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the impact of the deprescribing intervention on mortality.These methodological issues cast significant uncertainty on the benefits of deprescribing on mortality outcomes.

Large-scale, well-designed trials are needed to address this issue effectively.

# | INTRODUCTION

Deprescribing is defined as the act of reducing the dose or stopping medications that are deemed inappropriate in order to reduce polypharmacy and improve health outcomes. 1As older adults are likely to take several medications concurrently, deprescribing is a relevant intervention to optimize their medication use.However, the lack of robust evidence is often identified as a barrier to the implementation of deprescribing in primary care. 2 Therefore, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of deprescribing studies can play a significant role in filling the knowledge gap and facilitating the integration of this practice into healthcare.

9][20] While this result is encouraging for the health of older adults, it remains intriguing.In fact, many individuals who are subject to deprescribing are older and multimorbid, and therefore at higher risk of mortality.The impact of deprescribing must be considerable to identify a potentially slight difference in absolute risk.5][16][17][18] There is therefore a need to explore this paradox further.

If deprescribing were to reduce mortality, it could have a significant impact at the population level, given that the majority of older adults live in community settings.As clinical trials are the most robust design for generating evidence, reviews including such studies could help increase evidence-based data on deprescribing in this context.In a recent meta-analysis meeting these criteria, 11 medication reviews as part of deprescribing interventions were associated with a statistically significant reduction of mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58-0.95).Our goal was therefore to explore two dimensions that could explain this reduction in mortality risk: (1) the medications that were deprescribed-assuming that if deprescribing influences mortality, it must be through the stopped medications; and (2) the methodological aspectsassuming that if deprescribing is not the key behind the reduced mortality, the methodology must be.By appraising the articles included in the meta-analysis, we sought to generate general knowledge on deprescribing.Our focus on this specific example was driven by the need to evaluate the impact of deprescribing among community-dwelling older adults.Bloomfield et al.'s study 11 is a commendable, timely contribution that fills a significant knowledge gap, and it is worthy of a detailed examination to evaluate its potential to change practice.


# | METHODOLOGY


## | Data source and data extraction

We appraised the 12 randomized controlled trials that evaluated the impact of medication reviews on mortality, as identified by Bloomfield et al., 11 who conducted a literature search from January 1990 to February 2019.We extracted all basic information related to the study protocol (design, setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, follow-up and funding), the intervention (description of intervention in the exposed and non-exposed groups, including the definition of deprescription and tools used), the data sources that were used, the outcomes studied, the socio-demographic characteristics of the population and the statistical analyses performed.We extracted data on the medications used and the medications that were deprescribed.We also recorded whether mortality was the primary outcome.Data extraction was conducted by two independent reviewers (MG and CL) and reviewed by a third reviewer (CS) for accuracy.Our extracted data was compared to the data extracted by Bloomfield et al. 11


## | Data synthesis

We conducted a narrative synthesis by comparing the two dimensions that framed our hypotheses: the medications that were deprescribed and the methodological aspects of the studies.In the first case, we retrieved reported medications that were deprescribed, classified them by their therapeutic classes or other criteria (e.g., potentially inappropriate medications from predefined lists), and compared the type and number or proportion of medications deprescribed in each study.For the second dimension, which focused on methodology, we reported the measure of association used to explore the impact of deprescribing (e.g., crude proportion comparison, adjusted relative risks).We analysed the methodology using a combination of quality assessment criteria 22 and epidemiological principles 23 related to study design, internal validity (that is, selection, information and confounding biases) and statistical methods adapted to the context (such as repeated measurements, controlling for loss to follow-up).This approach provided flexibility and allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of relevant aspects that may pose challenges in deprescribing trials in older adults, including imbalanced groups and insufficient follow-up time.We also evaluated potential issues pertaining to the meta-analysis.

## Limitations in methodology to assess mortality

• Authors provide cumulative proportions of death for the 0-3, 0-6 and 0-12 months of follow-up, but no association measures are calculated.• Possible confounding bias as randomization led to imbalanced group for some variables (e.g., depression), and no information on baseline medications used in each group • Limited number of events + limited follow-up of 1 year may not provide statistical power to detect differences in mortality.

Limitations in methodology to assess mortality

• Mortality not measured in the study as a study objective, only number of deaths provided • No adjustments for potential confounders (only a proportion measured) • No information on the moment when the individuals died (before or after receiving the intervention) • The individuals who died were not included in the medication analysis; therefore, no association between changes in medication and death can be measured.• Deprescribing not main intervention, no information on medication changes • Very small sample size and possible selection bias (25 out of 222 potentially eligible patients were included).Very high-risk patients, not representative of the general population of older community-dwelling patients.

Of the studies reviewed, only one 24 reported a statistically significant lower proportion of deaths in the intervention group compared to the control group (6/136 vs. 14/130, p = 0.049 with a chi-square test).


## | Data on medication deprescribed

The interventions were not always successful in reducing the pharmacological burden or improving its quality.In fact, in five studies, there was no difference in medication use between the exposed and non-exposed groups. 24,27,28,33,34In one study, 35 the number of medications used increased (although the increase was more pronounced among the control group), and in one study, 32 it was not possible to conclude about medication use.As a result, less than half of the articles (5/12, 41%) 25,26,[29][30][31] reported a positive impact in the intervention group with regards to pharmacotherapy.This was reflected in a reduction in the total number of medications, 31 the number of Fall-Risk-Increasing-Drugs (FRIDs) medications, 25 the number of potentially inappropriate medications 26,30 or the number of drug-related problems. 29However, most studies provided minimal information on the medication deprescribed.For instance, specific groups of potentially inappropriate medications were not clearly described, and only four studies presented the classes of medications that were reduced or changed (stopped/substituted/started or dose changed), such as vitamins and minerals, antihypertensive, sedative or gastro-intestinal agents. 25,26,30,34Therefore, no specific conclusions could be drawn about the medications that were deprescribed in the studies.

Extracting information on deprescribed medications was a challenge, as many interventions included actions beyond deprescribing.Only two trials primarily focused on reducing the number of medications, specifically targeting medications on the FRIDs list 25 and anticholinergic/sedative medications to reduce the drug burden index (DBI). 34In the other studies, medication reviews took place as part of larger pharmaceutical care interventions, which involved not only stopping medications but also

28][29][30][31][32][33]35 Patients' participation in decision-making, which is central to deprescribing, was minimal or absent in most studies.


## | Methodology aspects

No study was designed to investigate mortality as the main outcome.Only four studies included mortality as a secondary or safety outcome. 26,31,32,34Therefore, the studies were not designed to be adequately powered to detect clinically significant differences between the groups regarding mortality, and the number of events was low.In all eight other trials, mortality was only reported descriptively (often in the flowchart without additional information) and without measures of association-let alone adjustment for confounding factors.As a result, mortality data were most often provided similarly to data on people lost to follow-up or those who withdrew consent.The individuals who died were excluded from the medication analysis, except in the study by Hanlon et al., which included the data using the last information caried forward method. 28Baseline characteristics of those who died, the timing of their death in relation to the intervention, medication use patterns or other details relevant for appreciating the association between the intervention and mortality were absent from most trials.Nonetheless, Campins et al. reported that deaths in the intervention group were not related to medication changes in their study. 26verall, the studies included relatively small samples and had short follow-up periods.The total number of randomized participants varied between 25 27 and 1188, 35 with five studies having total sample sizes of ≤150. 27,29,31,33,34Follow-up was less than 1 year in three studies (5 weeks, 27 3 months, 34 6 months 29,31 ), 1 year in seven studies [24][25][26]28,30,33,35 and 2 years in one study. 32 This shot follow-up makes it difficult to accurately assess mortality risk. Futhermore, since the studies were not specifically designed to measure mortality, important confounding factors, such as frailty, cognitive status, autonomy and level of dependency, were not thoroughly evaluated.Due to the small sample sizes, there is a high risk of an imbalanced distribution of these factors between the intervention and control groups at randomization-a phenomenon that was observed with other variables, albeit limited.26,28,30,33,34 In the study by Lampela et al., 30 17 deaths occurred in the intervention group and 38 in the control group before the start of the intervention/ equivalent evaluation, which illustrates that mortality risk could have been imbalanced between groups.


## | Aspects of the meta-analysis

Several deaths that were included in the two trials with the highest weight 30,35 occurred before the intervention.Additionally, in the trial with the largest weight, 30 the number of deaths also included individuals in institutional care and not just those living in the community, as was the objective of the meta-analysis.These situations may have artificially favoured better survival in the deprescribing group.

Crude proportions were used to compute the overall measure of association between deprescribing and mortality in the meta-analysis.Despite being a customary practice for meta-analyses with clinical trial data, the studies included had certain limitations that made such analysis challenging.All of the trials presented characteristics that raise concerns regarding the association between deprescribing and mortality, based on the core difficulty in assessing the relationship between exposure and outcome, the lack of adjustment for potential confounders and the very short follow-up time.The fact that the value of I 2 was 0 should not be considered reassuring, as it only reveals that between-study heterogeneity is not beyond what would be expected by chance alone.In reality, there was heterogeneity in other aspects of the trials, including the type of population involved, the medications studied and the deprescribing interventions performed.


# | DISCUSSION

The analysis we conducted does not allow us to confidently assert that deprescribing is associated with reduced mortality based on the studies included.Our study aims to draw attention to and provide a better understanding of the potentially critical issues that arise when studying deprescribing.Trials involving older adults are inherently challenging, and "perfect" trials are rare, making the conduct of meta-analyses more complicated.In this case, only four out of the 12 trials aimed to assess mortality, but only as a secondary outcome or from a safety perspective.These studies, along with the others, lacked the power to detect a clinically significant difference between groups and did not adapt the methodology to study mortality, such as assessing the presence of major determinants of mortality.Additionally, most trials did not explicitly evaluate deprescribing, and many interventions had no impact on the number or quality of medications.The small sample sizes of the trials likely led to imbalanced groups for many factors that could have influenced mortality, and short follow-up times were not suitable for unveiling differences in mortality risk.The meta-analysis was based on crude proportions of deaths in the two groups without considering the follow-up time of the studies.However, the likelihood of mortality events-and of observing a difference between the groups-is not similar if the follow-up time is different.

These aforementioned challenges are not unique to this meta-analysis.Indeed, previous reviews and metaanalyses on deprescribing have also encountered limitations similar to those identified in this review, including insufficient details on the deprescribing processes performed and outcomes obtained. 36This lack of detail may stem from the need or desire to individualize deprescribing approaches to patients 36 and the challenges associated with conducting clinical trials in older adults. 37owever, although understandable, this lack of detail can lead to imprecision and difficulties in generating syntheses.In particular, the varying conceptions of deprescribing complicate the combining of study results within meta-analyses.For example, Kua et al. focused on deprescribing in nursing homes, where diverse interventions were considered to fall under the umbrella of deprescribing. 14Subgroup analyses based on these interventions revealed distinct associations with mortality: medication review showed an OR of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.65-0.84),educational training had an OR of 1.19 (95% CI: 0.91-1.56)and comprehensive geriatric assessment had an OR of 1.73 (95% CI: 0.77-3.88). 14hile deprescribing has recently gained renewed interest, the tapering and cessation of medications have long been studied.However, previous research has not always emphasized the central role of patients in deprescribing.This may pose a challenge when conducting meta-analyses of older studies, as some interventions may not incorporate shared decision-making or planned follow-ups.In fact, the meta-analysis we examined revealed that only a few interventions involved shared decision-making, which is a central component of deprescribing. 38Replicating this work in the future, when there are more trials that conform to a standardized definition of deprescribing, would be valuable to improve our understanding of the topic.

The analysis did not yield any conclusive evidence on the types of medications that were deprescribed that could influence mortality risk.Most studies did not report any significant differences between the deprescribing and control groups regarding changes in therapy.Poor implementation and low uptake of interventions may have contributed to the lack of differences in medication use between the groups.On the occasions where differences in medication use were observed, a wide variety of medications were involved.However, it was impossible to establish the link between these deprescriptions and mortality.Furthermore, since many therapies have evolved over time and certain problems may be less frequent now (e.g., long-acting sulfonylureas would be less prevalent nowadays), there is a need to conduct further studies on deprescribing in current clinical practice.

To study the impact of deprescribing on mortality, it is essential to allow sufficient time for exposure (i.e., deprescribing) to occur and for any resulting effect to be observed.Short follow-up periods cast doubt on the ability to detect such an impact.Previous meta-analyses, both those suggesting a reduction in mortality 12,14,18 and those not showing such an association, 13,[15][16][17] encountered a similar limitation.The majority of the included pooled studies (88%-100%) had a follow-up of 1 year or less.Deprescribing is a lengthy process, especially for medications that may directly or indirectly influence mortality risks, such as psychotropic or cardiovascular medications.For example, reducing the use of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, sedatives and antihypertensives could decrease the risk of falls, hip fractures and other cascading events that could lead to death.Deprescribing these medications can take several months or even years.In the recent large hospital-based trial by McDonald et al., the medications that were most frequently deprescribed were products such as vitamins or stool softeners because they were easy and quick to discontinue. 39However, discontinuing such medications is unlikely to have an impact on health outcomes.Given that deprescribing essential medications requires time and that a follow-up period is necessary before observing any effect, it is challenging to detect differences in mortality among older populations with a short follow-up, even with the statistical power of a meta-analysis.

We would like to reiterate our commendation for the authors of the meta-analysis we evaluated, acknowledging their dedicated work and recognizing the challenges inherent in conducting a meta-analysis of this nature.Meta-analyses based on studies that share the same methodology, have similar health outcomes, exhibit little heterogeneity among participants and have a low loss to follow-up generally pose few issues.However, deprescribing trials in older adults do not meet these criteria.Researchers who undertake such meta-analyses must navigate through clinical trials that are not perfect, where compromises have had to be made, and which often have a small number of patients. 13,14,18They may also encounter situations where the main outcome(s) of the included studies differ from the one being evaluated in the metaanalysis, posing methodological challenges.For instance, similar to Bloomfield et al., 11 Reeve et al. faced several limitations when conducting their meta-analysis on deprescribing anti-hypertensive medications in older adults 13 : none of the four pooled RCTs assessed mortality as an outcome of interest, multivariable analyses were not included to minimize confounding biases and the majority of the trials dated back to before the 1990s.


## | Implication for research and practice

From a methodological perspective, RCTs are theoretically the best study design for evaluating interventions because randomization allows for potential confounding factors to be equally distributed among the groups.Nevertheless, RCTs are not immune to bias and lack of precision, and it can be challenging to draw conclusions about outcomes that were not the object of the trials.Mortality, in particular, is a complex health outcome that is influenced by numerous factors, and demonstrating the impact of deprescribing on mortality is a daunting task.If intermediate results (e.g., falls, hospitalizations) are not reduced by deprescribing, it is doubtful that mortality could be.Furthermore, if deprescribing has an impact on mortality, it cannot prevent it; at best, it can only delay it in older multimorbid people.Therefore, survival analyses would be more appropriate to identify any potential benefits.However, studying mortality as an outcome could be questioned.While safety is obviously a primary concern, it may be more fruitful to focus on outcomes that can affect the quality of life and the independence of older adults.Ultimately, investing time and resources into research that can improve the lives of older adults should be the priority, rather than focusing solely on the difficult task of quantifying the risk of death.

Deprescribing is a promising approach to address polypharmacy and suboptimal medication use, but it lacks sufficient evidence to demonstrate its benefits on various outcomes, including mortality.To quantify the impacts of deprescribing on health outcomes, rigorous, large-scale randomized trials and appropriate observational studies are needed.However, precision alone is insufficient; the quality of a meta-analysis is only as good as the individual data it is based on, even if the power to detect a difference is increased.Studies including deprescribing interventions more in line with shared decisionmaking will facilitate the conduct of such meta-analyses.Nonetheless, caution must be exercised in interpreting results due to the challenges inherent in conducting clinical trials involving older adults.
