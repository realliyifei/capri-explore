Despite tremendous advancements in human medicine, infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites remain a significant challenge to public health.These diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries due to the relative scarcity of medicines and the emergence of widespread drug resistance to antimicrobials or antibiotics.7Previously unproven data on the antimicrobial activity of many plants have been scientifically verified, coinciding with an increase in records of pathogenic microorganisms

## INTRODUCTION

Throughout history, natural remedies made from herbs have been used to treat various physiological disorders, and are generally considered safe.According to the World Health Organization, around 80% of the global population relies on herbal-based products to treat different ailments. 1he global market for herbal formulations is currently estimated at $1.5 billion and it is expected to expand significantly as demand for natural remedies used for preventing and curing different diseases increases. 1rbs/herbal products are vital sources of novel pharmaceuticals because they contain a significant amount of secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, lignans, quinones, catechols, coumarins, polyphenols, lectins, monoterpenes, and triterpenes which are accountable for the positive effects of the herbal products. 1,2The quality and quantity of these bioactive compounds determine the therapeutic effectiveness of herbal formulations. 1For instance, due to the abundance and diversity of the flavonoid and phenolic content of Datura stramonium, it has been reported to exhibit significant antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activities. 3rgemone mexicana, on the other hand, contains a lot of alkaloids and has traditionally been used to treat various dermatological disorders, warts, and inflammatory complications. 3 When monotherapy is inadequate to combat a clinical condition, traditional medicine employs polyherbal approaches. 4lyherbal medicines, which contain two or more herbal ingredients are often more effective than single drugs because of their complementary and/ or potentiating activities.The combination of two or more herbal extracts brings about increased therapeutic efficiency, enhanced pharmacological actions, faster relief, and reduced adverse effects as compared to conventional medicine due to a lower dose of administration. 1,2,4,5Polyherbal medicines are now widely preferred and used around the world because of their high effectiveness, ready availability, low toxicity, and environmentally friendly nature, and it reduces the time of treatment or the individual cost of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial drugs, resulting in lower prescription costs. 3,5The concept of polyherbal combination has been well established and has achieved remarkable success in allopathic medicine, providing patients with new hope. 6esistant to antimicrobials.Therefore, plant-derived products can regulate microbial growth in a variety of circumstances.Despite the development of new antibiotics over the last three decades, the problem of microbial resistance to these drugs has increased.Bacteria are known to have the genetic ability to transmit and acquire resistance to drugs used as therapeutic agents, 8 which underscores the importance of discovering and developing novel pharmaceuticals.

Inflammation refers to the response of tissue to harmful stimuli such as physical injury, irritants, and pathogens.This response is identified by an increase in vascular permeability, alterations in blood flow, and migration of leukocytes to the affected regions. 9e five distinguishing characteristics of inflammation are tumour (swelling/oedema), colour (redness), dolour (pain), fever (warmth), and functio laesa (organ/tissue dysfunction). 10The body responds to inflammation by releasing proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL-1β and IL-6), interferons (IFN), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).These cytokines induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which produces prostaglandins (PGs) leading to inflammation, swelling, and pain.Another inflammatory mediator, leukotrienes, is produced by the metabolism of arachidonic acids by lipoxygenase (LOX).Activation of macrophages results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which causes oxidative stress. 11idative stress stimulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) which exacerbate inflammatory diseases.Nitric oxide helps in the inhibition of mitochondrial enzymes and the activation of COXs in the production of PGs.Therefore, any substance or drug that inhibits COX-2, LOX, NO, and ROS can be useful in the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases. 11To manage inflammation, there are numerous drugs available, however, the most commonly used are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac, indomethacin, naproxen, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen. 12These drugs have limitations such as being palliative, inaccessible, unaffordable and having low efficacy, along with causing undesirable effects that may even be life-threatening. 9,13Therefore, more research is needed to explore medicinal plants or polyherbal medicines as potentially effective therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases.

Antioxidants play a crucial role in reducing cellular components' oxidation by molecular oxygen, preventing the chain reactions that result in the production of harmful free radicals like reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).By removing free radical intermediates and inhibiting further oxidative reactions while being oxidized themselves, antioxidants are considered as important as nutraceuticals due to their many health benefits.They protect the body against oxidative stress linked to various chronic diseases and disorders.Antioxidants are any substance that, even in minute concentrations, can inhibit or delay the oxidation of a substrate or other molecules. 14herefore, antioxidants due to their ability to scavenge free radicals could potential be useful in the prevention and treatment of diseases linked to oxidants or free radicals.Phenolic acids, which are found in plants, have been shown to have a variety of biological effects, including antioxidant activity. 15Antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase act as defensive mechanisms by providing NADPH, which is required for the regeneration of glutathione (GSH) and protection against oxidative damage.Additionally, oxidative stress can lead to a decrease in glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and a reduction in GSH content. 16e 2,2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay is a commonly employed in vitro antioxidant assay used to determine the antioxidant potential of polyherbal extracts and in measuring the radical scavenging capability.The biological agent's ability to scavenge free radicals can be used to calculate antioxidant activity. 17DPPH is a free radical having the strong ability to accept electrons to become a stable diamagnetic molecule.The potent DPPH radical scavenging activity of polyherbal formulation (PHF) has been attributed to its hydrogen-donating ability.The decrease in DPPH solution absorbance following the addition of PHF can be attributed to the strong reaction between the antioxidant-rich formulation and the DPPH solution.This reaction leads to the scavenging of the DPPH radical, which can be visualized by the colour change from purple to yellow in the DPPH solution upon the addition of PHF.The significant results of PHF in the DPPH in vitro antioxidant test indicate that it has a high reducing potential and can effectively scavenge free radicals. 18rthermore, ABTS assay involves the generation of a blue/green chromophore resulting from the reaction between ABTS and potassium persulfate.This assay measures the relative ability of antioxidant compounds in plant extracts to scavenge the ABTS radical cation (ABTS), compared to standard quantities of synthetic antioxidant Trolox and the water-soluble vitamin E analogue. 5Thus, antioxidants present in plants have potent properties for degenerating and scavenging harmful free radicals, such as ABTS. 5 This study has reviewed all the research work conducted on antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of polyherbal formulations in the past twelve year around the world.This is to validate and promote the use of polyherbal formulations, identify gaps in current knowledge and highlights area which more research is needed as well as to identified the herbal combination which can be used in the development of new pharmaceuticals.

Even though polyherbal remedies have reportedly been used for the management and treatment of various illnesses, concerns regarding their safety have been raised. 19It is important to note that the quality, safety, and efficacy of polyherbal formulations can vary depending on the source and preparation method.Therefore, standardized formulations and proper quality control measures are necessary to ensure their safety and efficacy.


## MATERIALS AND METHODS

The literature search was conducted from September 2022 to December 2022 and the study is based on a mixed-method review approach, which includes combining quantitative and qualitative research.A systematic comprehensive literature search was conducted on the following databases Google scholar, publishing sites such as Elsevier, JStor, Scopus, Science Direct, Cab Direct and BioMed Central (BMC), and PubMed.The databases and literature sources were chosen based on the topic covered and the main search and key terms included "polyherbal formulation", "antimicrobial", "anti-inflammatory", "toxicity" and "antioxidant activities".Search terms were set to be in the title, keywords, and abstract.The review focuses on work done on polyherbal medicine all over the world and the flow of study is shown in Figure 1.


## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The therapeutic use of non-toxic conventional medicinal plants is gaining increasing attention as an alternative and cost-effective approach for the prevention and treatment of various diseases. 20ccording to the World Health Organization, about 60-80% of the population in developing countries relies primarily on plants for their primary healthcare needs.The rise of herbal medicines has significantly increased foreign trade, and the global herbal medicine market is projected to hit approximately USD 117 billion by 2024. 21For centuries, natural herbs and extracts have been utilized in both developed and developing countries to cure different ailments.Natural products have a distinct chemical richness, which results in a diversity of biological activities and drug-like properties; as a result, they have emerged as one of the most valuable tools for creating new lead compounds and scaffolds.These products will continue to be used in order to meet the urgent need for effective drugs development, and they will play a pivotal role in the discovery of drugs for the treatment of human diseases. 22Moreover, synthetic antimicrobial agents available in the market exhibit certain drawbacks such as toxicity, low efficacy, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, and high cost, which render them ineffective.Therefore, the development of a potent cure derived from plants would be a significant step forward in the treatment of microbial diseases. 23,24lyherbal preparations, which are made from a combination of different medicinal plants, contain multiple bioactive constituents that interact with one another to achieve increased therapeutic effectiveness in the maintenance of human health. 25,268][29][30] This review reports that the polyherbal formulations exhibit significant antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities (Table 1), and play a major role in the treatment and management of various diseases.The article lists some commercial and non-commercial polyherbal formulations all around the world and found that India has topped the number of publications on polyherbal formulations followed by Nigeria, and Pakistan (Figure 2).


## Antimicrobial activity of polyherbal formulations

Based on ethnobotanical research, plants have been identified as a potential natural source of antimicrobial drugs that will provide novel or lead compounds that can provide unique or primary compounds to combat infections globally. 313][34] Tannins, for instance, are water-soluble polyphenols found in many plant foods and have been recognized as effective antibacterial agents against various pathogens.They have been reported to prevent the growth of microorganisms (fungi, yeasts, bacteria, and viruses) by precipitating microbial protein. 35,36annins can deactivate enzymes that cause microbial adhesion, as well as hinder the movement of certain proteins.They also combine with polysaccharides to form a complex. 37Similarly, flavonoids form a complex with either soluble or extracellular proteins and eventually bind to the bacterial cell wall.On the other hand, lipophilic flavonoids can considerably disturb the microbial cell membrane.Alkaloids are known to possess anti-tumour, analgesic, antispasmodic, and bactericidal potentials; Saponins are prominent for their anti-cancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, 35,36 and steroids contain anti-inflammatory activity. 35The antibacterial activity of these plant constituents is due to their ability to either block the production of the bacterial cell wall or disrupt the permeability of the cell membrane, ultimately resulting in the death of the microorganisms. 3,5tibacterial agents work by inhibiting or regulating enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, nucleic acid metabolism, and protein synthesis, a process known as translation inhibition.Another mechanism is membrane structure disruption, which causes changes in cellular functions.The majority of antibiotics are designed to reduce multiplication, thereby killing the organism.Some phytoconstituents in herbal formulations may bind to Gram-negative bacteria's membrane phospholipids and disrupt membrane integrity.Furthermore, it may inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis by blocking specific enzymes, thereby reducing the multiplication of bacteria and killing the organisms. 38e review findings revealed that the antimicrobial effectiveness of polyherbal formulations varied depending on the concentration and type of microorganisms tested.Some of the herbal remedies, such as THR-SK004, THR-SK010, and THR-SK011 used for the treatment of wounds demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against methicillinresistant S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. aureus with MIC 90 values of 4, 8 and 4 µg/mL respectively.This indicates that these herbal remedies meet the criteria proposed by Cos et al. (2006), which consider extracts with a selective activity and MIC values below 1-50 µg/mL as noteworthy.Also, polyherbal remedies such as Ambrex (8.7-23.4μg/mL), 4 Ya-Sa-Marn-Phlae (4-32 µg/mL) 20 , and KWTa, KWTb, KWTc, HBfs, HBts, AL, and FB (≤ 25 µg/mL) 39 had antimicrobial activities lower than 50 µg/mL, hence, they possess strong antimicrobial activity.

The majority of the polyherbal formulations demonstrated synergistic broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activity, with MIC values ranging between 0.625-10 mg/mL.Some of the formulations, such as Ambrex, Chyawanprash, Plashbijadi churna, Vranahitkara ghruta, NOQ19, and Polyherbal nano colloids, etc exhibited antimicrobial activity comparable to the standard drugs.This suggests that these polyherbal remedies have the potential to be used as alternative treatments for bacterial and fungal infections.However, some polyherbal remedies such as Leone Bitters, Chandra Kalka, Sharkaradi Kalka, and Diakure did not possess any antimicrobial activity.This  The nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory results revealed that THR-SK010 ethanol extract exhibited NO production inhibition activity with IC50 value of 71.06, while the water extract was apparently inactive (IC50 > 100 µg/mL).

highlights the importance of thoroughly researching and evaluating the effectiveness of polyherbal remedies before using them to treat infections.

Interestingly, Triple bark and some formulations showed antibacterial activity that was significantly higher than the control drugs, 40,41 while NOQ19 showed excellent antiviral efficacy, eliminating 100% of the virus at a concentration of 0.9 mg/mL, with an IC 50 of 0.2 mg/mL. 24hese findings suggest that certain polyherbal formulations have the potential to be used as effective treatments for bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.Additionally, the study found that some of the polyherbal remedies exhibited anti-tubercular activity, with the most active remedies being KWTa, HBfs, and HBts, which exhibited inhibitory activity against M. tuberculosis at 1.562 µg/mL. 39This highlights the potential of polyherbal remedies as an alternative or complementary treatment for tuberculosis, which is a major global health concern.According to Famewo et al. 42 some of these polyherbal formulations contain the essential mineral nutrients and vitamins that could probably be boosting the immune system of tuberculosis patients.Thus, they can enhance the immune system and help the host fight against microbial infections by increasing the activity of immune cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells.

The differences observed in the MIC values of the reviewed polyherbal formulations against various microorganisms could be attributed to several factors, including the mode of action of the formulations by direct inhibition of the growth and proliferation of microorganisms or disruption of microbial cell membranes, the differences in cell wall composition and/or genetic makeup of the microorganisms as well as the synergistic effects of different phytoconstituents present in the herbal formulations.These findings are important as they highlight the potential benefits of using polyherbal formulations.However, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these remedies on a larger scale and against a wider range of microorganisms.Additionally, studies should be conducted to determine the safety and potential side effects of these formulations before they can be recommended for widespread use.Overall, this review provides valuable insight into the potential of polyherbal remedies as a natural and effective means of treating bacterial infections.


## Anti-inflammatory activity of polyherbal formulations

4][45] The upregulated synthesis of inflammatory mediators results from the activation and enhanced activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), COX-2 enzymes, and pyrogenic cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin (IL-6), among others. 9,46herefore, to qualify as an anti-inflammatory agent in an in vivo assay, it should alter the effects of carrageenan-induced inflammation, leading to the alleviation of typical features such as redness, oedema, pyrexia, algesia, and tissue dysfunction. 46,47e results of the studies indicate that the polyherbal medicines investigated possess anti-inflammatory activities, with some of these remedies used in wound and diabetes management.Phytexponent, a polyherbal medicine used for pain and inflammation treatment, was examined for its anti-inflammatory activity using carrageenan-induced paw oedema mice.The study found that Phytexponent demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in a time-dependent manner, with greater efficacy at 250 mg/Kg BW than the positive control indomethacin (4 mg/Kg BW).The polyherbal medicine also significantly reduced oedema in a dose-and time-dependent manner, and it effectively inhibited both the early and late phases of inflammation.

The study suggests that Phytexponent's anti-inflammatory effects could be attributed to the inhibition of the COX enzyme.The timedependent increase in percentage inhibition of oedema may be due to a higher bioavailability of active molecules, following metabolism and distribution to target sites. 9Overall, these findings suggest that polyherbal medicines such as Phytexponent could be considered potential alternatives for the management of inflammation, as they demonstrate promising anti-inflammatory effects.Further studies are necessary to explore the mechanisms of action of this remedy.

In addition, IBS-20 used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, showed potent anti-inflammatory effects on innate immune cells in vitro as well as on the murine model of colitis in vivo, by suppressing the up-regulation of key inflammatory cytokines. 48Furthermore, Dev et al. reported that PHGs (2% and 5%) used for wound healing showed significant and maximal anti-inflammatory activity after 180 min in carrageenan-induced paw oedema as compared to normal control and negative control animal groups. 3The inflammation induced by the carrageenan lasts approximately up to 5 h after injection.Also, the AHPL/AYCAP/0413 Capsule used in the treatment of Acne exhibited anti-inflammatory activity with a significant reduction in rat paw oedema (51% inhibition) which was comparable to that of the control, Diclofenac (58% inhibition). 49The ethanolic extracts of THR-SK010 and THR-SK011 polyherbal inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production, suggesting its potential in the treatment of inflammation and wounds. 50he findings suggest that polyherbal medicines can be effective in managing inflammation and offer a safer alternative to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with their known adverse effects.

During inflammation, lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes can be released into the surrounding tissues, causing damage to organelles and leading to a variety of disorders.Researchers such as Chamara et al.

(2018) 51 have investigated the potential anti-inflammatory effects of polyherbal formulations using erythrocyte membrane stabilization methods.This method helps to determine if the formulations have the ability to stabilize lysosomal membranes and prevent the release of lysosomal components that can cause inflammation and tissue damage.Chamara et al. 51 found that both formulations exhibited moderate anti-inflammatory activities, which could be attributed to the phytoconstituents of the herbal formulations, which exert intense stabilizing effects on lysosomal enzymes.Lysosomal stabilization is important in reducing inflammation by preventing the liberation of lysosomal components of activated neutrophils which generally tend to cause tissue damage and inflammation. 52milarly, Abbas et al., 5 investigated the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of different extracts of polyherbal formulations used for treating urinary tract infections using the membrane stabilization method.The findings showed that the water extract (1 mg/mL) exhibit maximum inhibition of inflammation (36.54%), followed by ethyl acetate (33.27%), methanol (25.98%), and hexane (9.44%) extracts.The water, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts exhibited more effective activity than the standard anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac sodium (15.42%).It can be deduced that the phytoconstituents present in water extract may stabilize the lysosomal membranes and prevent the release of enzymes that can cause inflammation and tissue damage.Hence, the findings of these studies suggest that polyherbal formulations have the potential to prevent and cure inflammation and tissue damage that may be an emerging effect of various disorders.The stabilizing effects of phytoconstituents present in these formulations on lysosomal enzymes may play a critical role in reducing inflammation and promoting healing.

In conclusion, polyherbal medicines can exert anti-inflammatory effects through various mechanisms of action, depending on the specific herbs and their constitutent bioactive compounds.Polyherbal medicines may help prevent inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory enzymes involved in the production of inflammatory molecules, such as cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX); 53,54 by using antioxidants to scavenge free radicals and reactive oxygen species that are generated during inflammatory processes, thereby reducing oxidative stress and inflammation; 55 by modulating the immune system and reducing inflammation through regulation of the immune cells' (such as macrophages, T cells, and B cells) activities; 56 by stabilization of cell membranes and prevention of the release of pro-inflammatory molecules, such as cytokines and chemokines. 57Overall, polyherbal medicines can provide a comprehensive approach to preventing inflammation by targeting multiple pathways and molecules involved in the inflammatory response.However, it's important to note that the specific effects and mechanisms of individual herbs may vary, and the safety and efficacy of polyherbal formulations should be evaluated through rigorous scientific studies.

Antioxidants are molecules that can prevent, delay or remove oxidative damage caused by free radicals.They work by reacting with free radicals, which reduces the harmful effects of oxidative stress. 51he primary function of antioxidants is to neutralize the excess free radicals and safeguard cells against their toxic effects, thereby helping to prevent diseases. 15When produced in excess, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause oxidative damage by destroying antioxidant enzymes, damaging biological macromolecules such as DNA and RNA, and impairing cell signalling pathways, which can lead to apoptosis or cell death.Different antioxidant compounds can decrease oxidative stress by chelating free radicals, scavenging free radicals, or modulating the activities and levels of antioxidant enzymes and their reducing potential. 18In addition, phenolic compounds such as phenols, tannins, saponins, flavonoids, and steroids are also known to exhibit antioxidant properties. 58,59Therefore, phytocompounds are powerful antioxidants that can neutralize and eliminate harmful free radicals. 5ee radicals, especially ROS, are involved in carcinogenesis' initiation, promotion, and progression.Oxidative damage to DNA and cellular components caused by ROS can lead to cancer-related mutations. 60onsequently, antioxidants help in protecting the human body from ROS-induced damage, and consumption of natural antioxidants has been linked to a lower risk of cancer and other diseases associated with oxidative damage, which is linked to phenolic compounds and the phenolic hydroxyl group. 60e use of polyherbal formulations for their antioxidant properties has gained attention in recent years due to their potential to protect the human body from free radicals.Various methods, such as DPPH radical scavenging activity, FRAP assay, ABTS radical cation scavenging activity, hydroxyl free radical-scavenging activity, scavenging of superoxide radical, nitric oxide radical scavenging capacity, lipid peroxidation assay, and in vivo antioxidants in albino rats, have been used to confirm the antioxidant activity of these polyherbal formulations.

The results have shown that many of the polyherbal formulations exhibited strong antioxidant activities in a concentration-dependent manner, with some showing even more activity than standard drugs.For instance, the polyherbal formulation used for treating urinary tract infections showed the highest scavenging activity of 98.63% which was higher than the natural antioxidant rutin (60.32) and the synthetic BHT (64.40). 5Similarly, the Thalipathiri Chooranam used for the treatment of cough showed a gradual increase in nitric oxide radical scavenging activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximum reduction of 79.6 (100 μl), which was comparable to the positive control gallic acid (78.9).The reducing power of the remedy was highest at 100 μl (83.29), resulting in the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ by donating an electron.This indicates that the reduced power capacity of the extract can serve as a significant indicator of its potential antioxidant activity. 35e potent antioxidant activity of both THR-SK010 and THR-SK011 against free radicals such as DPPH and hydroxyl radicals may be due to the potent activity of active constituents present in the herbal formulations. 50The antioxidant capacity of most herbal sources is usually associated with their phenolic contents.Antioxidants that react quickly with free radicals may react slowly or may be inert to the DPPH radical. 5The higher DPPH radical scavenging activity observed in the polyherbal formulations indicates that the extracts can scavenge other free radicals in the human body.Therefore, natural antioxidant agents have gained attention because they can protect the human body from free radicals.

One study found that Habb-e-Asgand exhibited significant antioxidative potential against paracetamol toxicity by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-tranferase, catalase, and glutathione contents. 61Similarly, another study showed that rats treated with isoniazid and rifampicin experienced severe oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation, but supplementation with heptoplus and Liv 52 prevented oxidative damage and restored normal serum liver biochemical markers. 624][65][66] BV-7310, a combination of plant extracts, also demonstrated potent antioxidant activity, suggesting a synergistic effect on antioxidant activity. 67rthermore, the study showed that Virgoliv syrup exhibited significant antioxidant activity against CCl4-induced hepatic damage, as evidenced by the increased levels of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, GSH, and SOD. 68These findings suggest that polyherbal formulations have potential therapeutic value in protecting against oxidative stressrelated diseases.

However, some PHFs such as Evans healthy bitter, Yoyo bitter, Fidson bitter, Swedish bitter, Oroki herbal mixture, Pax herbal mixture, Asheitu Adams blood purifier, Asheitu Adams formula for diabetes, e.t.c cause depletion of hepatic antioxidant enzymes.The administration of Fidson bitters and Asheitu Adams blood purifier significantly decreased superoxide oxidase and glutathione-S-transferase concentrations in comparison with the control, while Yoyo bitter and Asheitu Adams formula mostly decreased reduced glutathione in a non-significant manner.Additionally, the PHFs caused a decrease in the CAT levels of the experimental animals, 14 which means that the continuous mobilization of these enzymes due to the daily introduction of free radical-generating polyherbal then led to the depletion of antioxidant enzymes as a result of exhaustion in the course of scavenging the overproduced free radicals.Also, the decrease in GSH concentrations, a naturally occurring antioxidant that prevents free radical damage to cells and helps in the detoxification process by conjugating with oxidants, must have resulted from the free radical scavenging activity of GST. 14 It is important to note that while polyherbal formulations have potential benefits, they may also have adverse effects if not used correctly.Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further studies to determine the appropriate dosage and duration of use to ensure maximum benefits and minimal side effects.Additionally, caution should be exercised when selecting and using polyherbal formulations, and it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before use.

In conclusion, polyherbal medicines may help prevent oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals and other reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative damage to cells and tissues; by upregulating the expression and activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT), which help to neutralize free radicals and prevent oxidative damage; by chelation of metal ions, such as iron and copper, which can generate free radicals and promote oxidative stress; and by reducing oxidative stress by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, such as cytokines and chemokines.


## Toxicological activity of polyherbal formulations

Currently scientists are trying to explore development of new polyherbal therapy.Phytochemcials such as, polyphenols and flavonoids have potent anticancer activities by involving regulation of various signal transduction pathways of cancer cell growth and suppression and proliferation of oncogenes and formation of tumor, modulation of enzyme activity, induction of apoptosis, reduction, oxidation, regulation of hormone metabolism and stimulation of the immune system and DNA repair. 69ladejana EB, et al.Biological Properties of Polyherbal Formulations: A Review of their Antimicrobial, Anti-Inflammatory, Antioxidant, and Toxicological Activities According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria, plant extracts with CC 50 < 30 μg/ml are considered to be cytotoxic after 48-72-hour exposure to cells. 70In the cytotoxicity assay, the therapeutic indexes of the ethanol extract of THR-SK010 were more than 10 (45.68 µg/ mL), indicating that the extracts exhibited no cytotoxicity as compared to the positive control ellipticine which had the value of 1.48 µg/mL. 50lso, phytexponent was found not toxic to Vero E6 cells (CC50 >1000 μg/ml) compared to the control cyclophosphamide (CC 50 =2.48μg/ mL). 9 The study of Devanathadesikan Seshadri et al. 69 revealed that the methanol extract of polyherbal fraction showed cytotoxicity against the two cell lines with the LC 50 value 467 ± 2.9 mg/ml against HeLa cell line and >800 mg/ml against MCF-7 cell lines.Thus, showing promising anticancer activity against HeLa and MCF cell lines.Phytochemcials such as, polyphenols and flavonoids have potent anticancer activities by involving regulation of various signal transduction pathways of cancer cell growth and suppression and proliferation of oncogenes and formation of tumor, modulation of enzyme activity, induction of apoptosis, reduction, oxidation, regulation of hormone metabolism and stimulation of the immune system and DNA repair.Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity test of a PHF1 using normal fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 and human malignant melanoma cell line A375 revealed that the formulation exhibited dose dependent inhibitory activity in the two tested cell lines.It exhibited dose-dependent toxicity (66.57% inhibition) against fibroblasts cells at the highest dose (320 μg/mL), and exhibited higher inhibitory activity (61.88%) against human malignant melanoma A375 cell line.Hence, it had cytotoxic effect against melanoma cancer cell line. 71 addition, Ramamoorthy et al. 41 rated cytotoxicity of the polyherbal formulation on the basis of the percentage viability relative to control group.Samples are considered non-toxic, if the viability is > 90%; the value between 60-90% viability indicates a slight toxicity; 30-59% means a moderate toxicity; and the values < 30% indicates that the sample is severely toxic to the cells. 72Hence, the result showed that the increasing concentration of the extract decreases the viability of cells and the IC 50 value of the extract is found to be 274.30μg/mL.PHF5 displayed anticancer activities via apoptosis.After 48 h, PHF5 showed a promising inhibitory effect against all cancer cells.The IC 50 values of PHF5 were 71.8, 64.8, 45.3, and 47.3 μg/mL against LoVo, HepG2, MCF-7, and MDA-MB 231 cells, respectively.The PHF5 extract reduced the viability of all cell lines in a dose dependent manner and the results confirmed that the inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation by the PHF5 extract was capable of inducing apoptosis. 73 the acute and sub chronic assays, most of the polyherbal formulations were found to be highly effective at low dose and highly safe even at high dose.For instance, DAS-77® used for the treatment of piles, dysentery, cholera, menstrual pain, stomach disorder, ulcer, constipation, diarrhoea and sexually transmitted infections did not induce lethality in mice when administered orally up to 20 g/kg in divided doses.

According to the assertion of Clarke and Clarke, 74 a substance that does not produce lethality up to 10 g/kg orally is relatively non-toxic, hence the herbal preparation can be said to be safe when administered orally.

In the study of Singh et al., 75 PHF used for the treatment of dysentery was reported to be safe as no mortality of animals was observed, no significant changes in behavior, postural abnormalities, impairment in food and water intake, and loss or yellowing of hair were also observed in the rats.In addition, Tabsaab used for the cure of tuberculosis was observed for 8-weeks and a 100% recovery rate in females and a 98% recovery rate in males, with no toxicity or side effects was observed in the patients. 76e sub chronic administration some remedies did not cause any significant changes in the serum activities of liver-function enzymes, hematological and histopathological parameters, serum electrolytes and other evaluated blood-chemistry indices.[79][80][81][82][83][84] However, in the sub-acute toxicity study of Hab-e-Kabad Noshadri tablets used for the treatment of hepatitis, enlargement of liver at doses of 100 and and 200 mg/kg/day, morphological changes with some damage in liver and kidney tissues of male and female animals was observed.Hence, prolonged use at higher dose i.e. 200 mg/kg/ day of this polyherbal formulation should be avoided. 85Also, decrease in the body weight was observed in rats that received higher doses of Leone Bitters, no morphological changes in the colour of the organs however, the histological result revealed that at the dose of 500 mg/ kg bwt, the drug may have affected the sperm production rate in the testis. 86In addition, at 1 ml/kg, there was a significant increase in total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and urea in the rats that received HB cleanser Bitters.A significant decrease was observed in the levels of total protein and albumin compared to negative control.Hence.HB cleanser Bitters may adversely affect hepatic and renal indices and therefore should be used with caution. 87


## CONCLUSION

The use of herbal medicine is gaining popularity due to the increasing prevalence of drug resistance in bacterial populations.While plantderived medicine is believed to be safer than synthetic drugs and provides profound therapeutic benefits, polyherbal formulations should be seen as adjunctive therapies that can boost immunity against diseases, rather than as replacements for conventional antibiotic treatments.This comprehensive review has shed light on the various benefits of polyherbal formulations in terms of their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and toxicological properties.It is worth knowing that the formulations have been traditionally used in the treatment and management of various diseases.The reviewed studies have demonstrated the potential of polyherbal formulations as an alternative approach to modern medicine.They have shown great potential as sources of nutraceuticals with high therapeutic importance, and they could serve as a blueprint for future developments in the pharmaceutical sector.However, there is a need for further research to validate the efficacy and safety of these formulations, carry out more clinical studies, identify the active constituents responsible for their therapeutic properties, and standardize their preparation and dosage.With the increasing demand for natural remedies, this review provides useful insights into the potential use of polyherbal formulations in the development of new pharmaceuticals.The folklore system of medicine has led to a scientific revolution in nutraceuticals and phytopharmacotherapy, and the use of polyherbal formulations is likely to increase in the future.This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, healthcare professionals, and the general public interested in the potential benefits of polyherbal formulations.
