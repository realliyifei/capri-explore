IntroductionParamedics routinely rely upon two assessment and treatment algorithms, known as the primary survey and the secondary survey to guide their care.Despite their ubiquity, there is no international consensus for the assessments and interventions that are included in, or omitted from, these algorithms.Methods A Delphi process evaluated Australasian paramedic clinical practice guidelines alongside six other international paramedic CPGs from the

## Introduction

Internationally, paramedics confront the challenge of rapidly identifying, approaching, assessing, treating and transporting or referring patients in a variety of clinical situations.Patient conditions range from low acuity to the imminently life threating, in circumstances that can range from unremarkable to extremely challenging and dangerous.In order to practice in a consistently organised and comprehensive manner, paramedics rely upon performance algorithms, often documented in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).Frequently these CPGs recommend that paramedics conduct two algorithmically sequential approaches respectively entitled the 'primary survey' and the 'secondary survey'.Whilst paramedicine adopted these terms from the practice of medicine, their application in CPGs is inconsistent.

The 2013 iteration of the St John Ambulance, Northern Territories (Australia) CPGs (1) contains a concise and comprehensive description of what a primary and secondary survey should be.They state "The primary survey is a rapid procedure designed to identify life-threatening conditions that require immediate intervention" (1, p.238) and "the secondary survey is a comprehensive compilation of clinical signs and symptoms, measured in combination with pertinent medical history, which is the foundation of a detailed patient examination" (1, p.238).They also offer an important general principle to consider with any patient encounter: "patient assessment is not a singular event, but a continuous process that constantly considers and re-evaluates clinical presentations" (1, p.238).

The structure most commonly used by Australasian state ambulance services to format the primary survey is adopted from the Australian and New Zealand Committee on Resuscitation and uses the initialism DRS ABCD to guide the practitioner to sequentially take the following steps (Text box 1)

Text box 1 -DRS ABCD.Adapted from the ANZCOR Basic Life Support Flowchart, Jan 2016.(2) The DRS ABCD initialism aims to guide basic life support providers through an unfamiliar situation.We question whether it is sufficiently comprehensive to cover the full scope of practice of professional paramedics in the delivery of out-of-hospital advanced medical care.For example, there is no mention of assessing the integrity of the cervical spine, or consideration of how to change the approach in a mass casualty incident.

The contents of the secondary survey are more ambiguous and, depending on the author, may include any combination of the following factors: Continue CPR until responsiveness or normal breathing returns.D as well as nationally developed CPGs from the United Kingdom (UK), Republic of Ireland, the USA, South Africa, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).This review was used as a basis for the development of a consensus of meaning of the terms 'primary survey' and 'secondary survey' in the context of out-of-hospital advanced paramedical care.


## Methods

This was a review of publicly accessible documents, and thus no ethics approval was required.Where possible, the authors identified the most up to date versions of clinical practice guidelines and skills manuals directly from the internet.Alternatively, where current documents were not accessible, we requested these directly from the organisation via email communication.Only the full versions of the CPGs were used; the panelists did not refer to pocketbooks or other summaries of the CPGs.The CPGs examined were current as of the date indicated for each reference.

For the first phase of the research, the principal investigator (PI) (MAC), identified and sourced the initial list of nationally representative CPGs and developed a draft data tool.The selected CPGs were reviewed against the tool to capture any missed reference points on the primary or secondary survey.After completing the first iteration of the data tool, the PI recruited the first cohort of three panelists for the Delphi process.Additional panelists were recruited through snowballing with the final Delphi panel having five members.The PI included all the panelists in the author group for this paper.For selection, a panelist required specialist knowledge, experience or qualifications with paramedic education and CPG development.The panelists' represented a broad international group, including practicing as clinicians and academic paramedics in: the UK (GE), Republic of Ireland (AB), Australia, South Africa (CC), Canada (MAC, AB), the USA (MRC), and New Zealand (SM).Additionally, CC was the editor of the Qatar CPGs and worked clinically in that context, and AB was involved in the development of the UAE CPGs and treatment protocols.

Panelists were asked to identify additional relevant national CPGs for review.Each panelist independently reviewed their allocated clinical practice guidelines.Allocations related to their country of practice/expertise.CPGs were reviewed for any content that outlined assessment or interventions defined within the terms 'primary survey' or 'secondary survey'.Any concept that was considered part of either the primary or secondary survey was recorded using the quantitative tick-box data tool developed by the PI.Panelists could suggest additions to the tool, based on review of their allocated CPGs.Once all of the CPGs were evaluated and additional concepts had been included, they were ordered and summarised.

Text-box 2 and Text-box 3 list the CPGs and further explanatory documents, such as skills manuals or clinical work instruction manuals which were assessed.We included data from these resources that mentioned initial and subsequent concepts (defined as either assessments or interventions) in the results section of this paper.Notably, Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) guidelines for Emergency Care Technician, published on the HPCSA website, did not include any specific mention of the primary and secondary survey.

The second phase of the research project involved the facilitation of the Delphi process by the PI to reach consensus on the final inclusions for the International Paramedic Primary and Secondary Surveys (IPPSS).The information from the first phase formed the final list the panel used to develop the IPPSS.The PI facilitated thirteen Delphi iterations, where panelists reviewed the inclusions and ordering of the assessment and interventions relevant to the primary and secondary survey of the IPPSS.During the consultation round, panelists could make recommendations for additional items to be included in the primary and secondary survey based on their professional experience.


## Results

The primary and secondary surveys reported in this paper present a combination of over 100 unique assessments and interventions present in the CPGs examined that could be included in a primary and secondary survey.Due to the volume and complexity of this information, the panelists agreed upon a simplified format for remembering and presenting the concepts.Two mnemonics were included to help clinicians remember the


## The Primary Survey

The primary survey summarises the assessments and interventions used to guide the professional paramedic or other health care professional through the first few minutes of patient contact in any setting.Included are concepts important in: establishing scene safety; developing an overview of the incident and the context in which it occurred; determining whether there are immediate life threats to the patient, which need to be addressed; highlighting early, important decisions which need to be made; and, guiding the paramedic with extrication and transport considerations.

There are three points in the first few moments of contact that refer specifically to ensuring safety.We differentiate between appropriate precautions to prevent infections (the first point of the mnemonic under the title 'Safety') and general scene safety (the second point of the mnemonic under the title 'Fear') as both are essential and sufficiently different to merit their own mention.The second 'T' (for 'Threats'), point nine of the primary survey mnemonic, occurs after first contact with the patient and stresses the importance of re-ensuring global scene safety before focusing attention on the assessment of the ABCDEs.Although the mnemonic has no further reminder of repeated safety checks, the expectation is this will remain an ongoing, dynamic, and primary consideration.The primary survey we present can be remembered using the mnemonic "Safety first.Get A BCDEs".The mnemonic is outlined in Table 1.


## The Secondary Survey

The secondary survey outlines assessments and interventions to guide the professional paramedic or other health care professional, through the remaining entirety of the patient encounter, including patient handover to other healthcare professionals when required.Individual items in the physical examination of the patient were not included as these were felt to be context-specific.Determining a 'mandatory' set of physical examinations to be performed (beyond vital signs) was considered to be overly prescriptive and likely too complex.However, this is an area for future review.If individual items of the physical exam are included the list of concepts in the secondary survey would be well over 50, bringing the total combined number of concepts in the primary and secondary survey to well over 100.As aide memoire for the secondary survey we present we chose the mnemonic "I See I HA D V itals A ssessed and Treated".The mnemonic is explained in Table 2 This format of the secondary survey has the advantage of that it serves as an outline for a patient handover to another health professional.The first three items ("ICI") establishes: patient identity; their presenting complaint or condition; and information about the incident and their current condition.This would be an appropriate handover to deliver, for example, to a triage nurse in an emergency department.The remaining six items ("H A D V itals A ssessed and Treated") give a concise overview of the patient's Any other treatment required immediately based on presentation so far Assess:

Current environmental conditions (e.g.heat, cold, wind, rain, direct sun, impending danger) Egress route to transportation (manual handling considerations, obstacles, dangers) Consider:

Immediate/emergent extrication (e.g. if unsafe scene) Expedited extrication (e.g.'load and go' for time critical patients) Protection from potentially adverse environmental conditions if staying on scene Requesting additional assistance (e.g. higher level medical assistance, rescue services in cases of entrapment or complex egress, law enforcement, animal control, etc.) Appropriate transport method (e.g.bariatrics, air transport) Appropriate transport destination (e.g.cardiac or trauma bypass, paediatric centre, neuro centre, etc.) Note: the ABCDE order of presentation in this part of the primary survey is meant to aid in initial memorization.The experienced clinician will recognize that different cases will require different approaches based on the patient's presentation (e.g.conscious v unconscious, acute v non-acute, trauma v medical, etc.) *prn = "pro re nata", or 'as required'.MCI = Multi Casualty Incident.status as well as their response to any treatment administered and considerations for future assessment and treatment.This would be appropriate to report to a receiving team in the emergency department, or to another health care professional in a non-urgent setting, as well as to include in the appropriate patient care documentation.

## Discussion

Although the primary and secondary surveys presented in this paper are detailed, we do not intend these to be rigidly prescriptive.We recognise that paramedics may, and must, adapt any aide memoir to the requirements of their particular patient presentation and clinical context.The intent of these surveys is to assist paramedics and paramedic students in their clinical approach, not to prescribe a mandatory checklist for every patient encounter.

The surveys presented are likely to be most useful to students learning to become paramedics, as opposed to existing, veteran paramedics.Working paramedics are likely to be already be utilising the concepts in these surveys in their existing practice.For paramedic students however, memorising over 100 unique concepts to practice in order and without omission, under novel and stressful conditions, is a daunting proposition.It is the author groups' hope that this work will assist them in that effort.

While the complexity of the presented surveys may initially appear daunting, the PI (MAC) has taught a variant of this algorithm with anecdotal student success as measured through assessments.

These surveys present a global perspective, but are weighted in favour of the Australasian (Australia and New Zealand) paramedic context.When looking for CPGs from outside of Australasia the panelists selected CPGs that were national in scope.Many paramedic based CPGs exist internationally, however we did not evaluate these for this work, as the author group were unfamiliar with the context in which they were applied.Therefore, there could well be important concepts that are missing from these primary and secondary surveys.At present, there are no national Canadian CPGs to include in this review, however, the presented work draws on the experiences of two of the authors who are familiar with Canadian paramedic practice and education (AB and MAC).

Although we intended this work primarily for paramedics, any clinician may use these surveys in an out-of-hospital clinical environment.The mnemonic works as an aide -memoire to assist in recollection of the primary or secondary survey.The title "International Paramedic Primary and Secondary Surveys" indicates that these guidelines were drawn from paramedic practice, not that their use should in any way be exclusive to paramedics.The author group welcome and encourage discussion around and adoption of these guidelines by any clinician who would consider them useful.


## Conclusion

This paper presents a comprehensive, focused, and memorable pair of mnemonics to guide paramedics and other clinicians through the primary and secondary survey of patient care.It utilises the current best practice of paramedics internationally, and the collective clinical, educational and academic experiences of the panel members.These mnemonics can be used by practicing paramedics to ensure that their care is complete and by paramedic students as they learn to handle the complexity of paramedic practice.The secondary survey also presents a useful structure for formulating patient handover
