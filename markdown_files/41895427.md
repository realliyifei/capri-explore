## INTRODUCTION

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by predominant involvement of the spine and/or sacroiliac joints. It consists of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease and undifferentiated type [1] . Axial (SpA) comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases which predominantly involve the axial skeleton and have many overlapping clinical features. The axial SpA spectrum ranges from non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA) at one end to AS at the other. Nr-axSpA comprises SpA patients without definite sacroiliitis on pelvic X-ray [2] . The most important clinical and laboratory features of this group are inflammatory back pain, enthesitis, dactylitis, extra-articular manifestations (acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease) and association with HLA-B27.

Low bone mass [osteopenia or osteoporosis (OP)] and osteoporotic vertebral fractures are well known complications of SpA, especially in AS [3] . The pathogenesis and onset of OP in SpA is not clear. The prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) has been reported to be as high as 47% at the hip and lumbar spine even in patients with early SpA [4] . Patients with SpA may have increased risk of bone loss as a result of high disease activity, pro-inflammatory cytokines, mechanical factors (i.e., rigidity of the spine, vertebral deformities) and decrease in physical activity or mineralization defects due to subclinical gut involvement [5,6] . Several techniques have been used to measure bone mineral density in SpA including quantitative ultrasound (QUS), quantitative computed tomography (QCT), highresolution peripheral QCT (HRpQCT), single-photon absorptiometry, dual photon absorptiometry, dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and morphometric X-ray absorptiometry [7][8][9][10][11] . Among these techniques DXA can be considered as an accurate, repeatable and quantitative method to assess BMD at the spine and hip [12] . Several studies have indicated that DXA may be a misleading method to assess BMD in advanced AS. New bone formation and aberrant hyperostosis inevitably cause a pseudo increase in bone density. However the most appropriate and valid method to assess BMD in patients with advanced AS is still unclear. A systematic evaluation of DXA methods used to assess BMD in SpA is strongly needed. Therefore this comprehensive review will examine the published literature assessing bone density in patients with axial SpA particularly those studies using DXA as the measurement method.


## MATERIALS AND METHODS

The MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles published between September 1992 and November 2013. The following search terms (synonyms and combinations) were used: "ankylosing spondylitis" OR "spondyloarthritis" OR "spondyloarthropathy" AND "bone loss" OR "bone mass" OR "osteopenia" OR "bmd" OR "bone mineral density" OR "osteoporosis" OR "fracture" AND "mri" OR "ct" OR "resonance" OR "computed tomography" OR "densitometry" OR "dxa" OR "dexa". The references of the reviewed articles were manually scanned for other relevant studies. Studies in which bone loss was investigated by using DXA in patients with SpA were eligible. The selection criteria consisted of original articles involving humans and published in English. Articles were excluded if they were case reports, review articles or meta-analyses and did not measure bone density by using DXA. Each article was reviewed and the key elements are summarized in Tables 1-3. Figure 1 shows the flow chart and the selection process. There were 286 hits on MEDLINE, 200 on Web of Science and 476 on Scopus. Using the abovementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified 55 articles (Cross sectional studies: 41, followup studies: 6 and interventional studies: 8) in our systematic search.


## RESULTS


## Population of the studies

Fifty five articles are summarized in Tables 1-3. The sample size of the studies varied from 14 to 332 patients with SpA including AS, ReA, PsA, undifferentiated SpA and nr-axSpA. The reported age range varied from 25 to 56 years in the reviewed studies. The reported symptom duration of patients with axSpA ranged between 1.6 to 49 years. As expected, there were more males than females in these studies. Most of the recruited females were premenopausal women. Reported HLA-B27 positivity changed between 19% to 95% and vertebral fractures were reported with a prevalence of up to 39% in the reviewed studies. The prevalence of OP and osteopenia in patients with SpA varied from 3%-47% WJO|www.wjgnet.com Table 1

## Conclusion

## Techniques used to detect BMD

We included studies which used DXA as the technique of BMD assessment in patients with axSpA. Eleven of the 55 studies were comparative studies in which DXA techniques were compared with QUS [7,13,14] , single energy QCT [8] , QCT [9,[15][16][17][18][19] , dual-energy QCT [20] , peripheral QCT [20] and HRpQCT [9] . Regarding the comparative studies, one study demonstrated that QUS correlated with DXA [13] but this result was not confirmed in any other study [7] . On the other hand, Jansen et al [14] demonstrated similar performance with QUS compared to DXA in detecting OP-associated fracture risk. Numerous QCT studies demonstrated higher prevalence of OP compared to those studies which used DXA as the assessment tool [8,9,18] , whereas only one study revealed no difference between QCT and DXA [20] . Two studies revealed a good correlation between QCT and DXA [9,15] , however lumbar spine DXA was shown to be less useful than QCT to detect the degree of osteopenia in late stage AS [15,17] . The change in bone formation and resorption markers including bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP), osteocalcin (OC), C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type â  collagen (CTX), and deoxypyridinoline is presented in Table 4. There are conflicting results regarding the levels of bone formation and resorption markers in patients with AS and other forms of SpA.


## Relationship between BMD, disease activity and acute phase reactants

There are conflicting results regarding the relationship between disease activity, acute phase response markers and bone mass. Some studies suggested a good correlation between bone mass with disease activity [16,[21][22][23][24][25][26] and acute phase reactants [4,16,21,[23][24][25][26][27][28] , whereas others [7,13,20,29] did not report a significant relationship. A recent study revealed the close association between bone mineral density and magnetic resonance (MR) defined acute inflammatory changes in the lumbar spine [30] . The results of this study, as well as the results obtained in patients with early inflammatory back pain, clearly defined the inflammation induced bone loss in patients with axial SpA [21,30] .


## Changes in bone mass and longitudinal studies

Patients with active disease (BASDAI > 4) had significantly lower proximal femur BMD compared to patients with inactive disease, whereas spinal BMD was similar in the study by Kaya et al [31] . After 24-mo of follow-up lumbar spinal BMD increased in both groups; however hip BMD decreased in the inactive group [31] .

On the other hand, GratacÃ³s et al [6] reported that BMD at the lumbar spine and at the femoral neck decreased in patients with active disease but no change was observed in patients with inactive disease after 19 mo of follow-up. There are conflicting results in followup studies. For examples, Maillefert et al [32] reported unchanged lumbar BMD but decreased femoral neck after 12 mo of follow-up, whereas Haugeberg et al [33] failed to demonstrate significant reduction in hip, spine or hand BMD. C-reactive proteine (CRP) levels have been suggested as an independent predictor of BMD change in patients with AS [6] . Additionally, femoral neck BMD has been found to be associated with persistent systemic inflammation which was defined by elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) [32] .

The report was a case report, review article or meta-analyses Did not report patients with SpA Measurement methods did not include DXA other hand, another study failed to show significant interactions among spinal or hip BMD measurements and age, body mass index, disease duration, lumbar Schober, BASDAI, ESR or CRP [31] . Although bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index had a significant negative effect on hip BMD [31] .

An 8 year follow-up study revealed that hip bone loss was associated with raised baseline CRP levels, MR defined bone marrow edema of the SIJs and the presence of radiographic sacroiliitis [33] .


## Change in bone mass after anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy

In all interventional studies BMD at the lumbar spine [34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41] increased in patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Additionally, hip BMD also increased [34][35][36][37][39][40][41] except for one study in which hip BMD remained unchanged [38] . Baseline bALP, OC and CTX levels significantly correlated with the increase in spinal BMD at weeks 24 and 102 after anti-TNF therapy [40] . Changes in acute phase reactants as well as disease activity scores have been demonstrated to correlate with the changes in BMD measurements [36,39,41] . Spinal BMD changes were shown to be associated with changes in ESR and newly formed syndesmophytes under anti-TNF therapy [36] .


## DISCUSSION

OP is a well-known problem in patients with AS which begins in the early stages of the disease and inevitably causes vertebral fractures [42][43][44] . The reported prevalence of OP in AS varies from 3% to 47% according to the measurement techniques and patient selection criteria used. Osteopenia has been reported in up to 88% of patients with SpA. An increased prevalence of spinal bone loss may occur even in early and mild forms of SpA [8,[42][43][44][45][46] . Systemic inflammation may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of OP in patients with systemic inflammatory disorders including SpA. This notion is supported with data from studies revealing reduced spinal BMD in patients with early or mild disease without advanced structural damage at the spine [20,21,30,43,47] . In advanced cases, spinal ossifications may mislead normal or artificially increased BMD at the lumbar spine. In such cases DXA measurements of the spine with lateral projections have been suggested to improve sensitivity [27,48] . On the other hand, the precision of DXA measurements on the lateral spine is reasonably lower than on the AP spine or proximal femur [27,48] .

As an alternative method QCT, which selectively measures trabecular and cortical bone density, can be used to determine spinal BMD in cases with advanced structural changes [8,9,19,20] . Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is known as the reference method to measure BMD. It is an accurate, reproducible, and non-invasive method with good short or long-term precision. Multiple skeletal sites can be safely and precisely assessed by DXA [49] .

Direct radiography is still a valid method for assessing structural damage in patients with axial SpA; however it gives little information about bone density since demineralization needs to reach 50% in order to confirm a reliable bone loss on radiographs. Higher incidence of bone loss at the hip compared to the lumbar spine has been suggested in various studies conducted in patients with AS [7,14,15,20,24,44,[46][47][48]50] . There are inconclusive results regarding the association between DXA measurements with clinical and laboratory findings. Bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip has been shown to correlate with BASDAI [16,[24][25][26] , ESR [16,[24][25][26]28] and CRP [16,[24][25][26]28] . However conflicting results have also been reported [7,13,20,29] .

The follow-up studies included in this review revealed that BMD measurements at the proximal hip usually decreased but lumbar spinal measurements increased or were unchanged after a reasonable followup.

Regarding the interventional studies, we identified 8 studies which assessed the influence of TNF blocking therapy on BMD in patients with SpA. In 7 out of 8 studies, BMD at the lumbar spine and proximal hip increased after treatment with anti-TNF drugs [34][35][36][37][39][40][41] .

The positive effects of these potent anti-inflammatory treatments (TNF blockers) on BMD indirectly support the role of systemic or local inflammation in bone metabolism.

In patients with SpA, bone loss starts in the early stages of the disease and can be prevented with TNF blocking treatments that have been shown to reduce inflammation at the skeletal sites. DXA is the most suitable technique to determine bone mass at both the lumbar spine and proximal femur in early or nonadvanced cases. However it may cause misleading results particularly at the AP lumbar spine due to the aberrant ossification or degenerative changes. Despite its limitations, DXA measurements with lateral spinal projections or QCT may be a solution to 307 March 18, 2015|Volume 6|Issue 2| WJO|www.wjgnet.com

## COMMENTS


## Background

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by predominant involvement of the spine and/or sacroiliac joints. Low bone mass [osteopenia or osteoporosis (OP)] and osteoporotic vertebral fractures are well known complications of SpA, especially in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The pathogenesis and onset of OP in SpA is not clear.


## Research frontiers

Low bone mass and osteoporotic vertebral fractures are common complications of SpA, especially in AS. The prevalence of low BMD has been reported to be as high as 47% at the hip and lumbar spine even in patients with early SpA. Patients with SpA may have increased risk of bone loss as a result of high disease activity, pro-inflammatory cytokines and decrease in physical activity or mineralization defects due to subclinical gut involvement.


## Innovations and breakthroughs

This review includes studies, which used dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the technique of BMD assessment in patients with axSpA. In twenty percent of studies, DXA techniques were compared with quantitative ultrasound or different type of quantitative computed tomography. Among these techniques DXA can be considered as an accurate, repeatable and quantitative method to assess BMD at the spine and hip but new bone formation and aberrant hyperostosis inevitably cause a pseudo increase in bone density.


## Applications

The most appropriate and valid method to assess BMD in patients with advanced AS is still unclear. A systematic evaluation of DXA or alternative methods used to assess BMD in SpA is strongly needed.

At the end of the follow-up period, patients

Loss of bone mass only in patients 
with persistent active AS suggests that
