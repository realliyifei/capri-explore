engage in research-informed practice and practice-informed research.However, there remains a need in social work education for more widespread use of culturally relevant pedagogies that can help achieve these goals.Informed by both the Afrocentric and Black perspectives, this study presents a content analysis of the curricula infused at two historically Black universities.The nature and extent of the contributions of historically Black universities to social work education is the focus of this article.The scope of this investigation also includes the identification of prominent Black social work educators and discusses the implications of these perspectives for more culturally informed gerontology curricula that promote culturally competent gerontological social workers

impact on their identity, health, and well-being.Interviews with 125 AN Elders were conducted across five regions of Alaska: Bristol Bay, Interior, Norton Sound, Aleutian Pribilof Islands, and Southcentral.AN Elders traveled between rural and urban communities to access resources and connections critical to their identities, health, and well-being.Urban Elders maintained a connection to rural villages because they perceive them as healthier places to age based on access to traditional practices, land, and the community.Rural Elders spent extended time in urban settings to access health care services, be closer to family, and to benefit from the lower costs of living.This study builds upon existing migration theories by introducing a cyclical pattern uniquely driven by AN identity, culture, and traditional practices.Everyday discrimination-experiences of being treated unfairly based on background characteristics like race-is linked to poor physical and mental health throughout the lifespan.Whether more experiences of discrimination are associated with higher likelihood of being hospitalized in older African Americans has not been explored.Hospitalization can represent both poor health and healthcare access.Participants were community-dwelling African Americans from the Rush Memory and Aging Project or Minority Aging Research Study, longitudinal studies of aging (N=301 with at least 12 months linked Medicare fee-for-service claims; mean age 72.5 years (standard deviation [SD]: 5.7), 79% female).Discrimination was assessed using the Detroit Area Study Everyday Discrimination Scale.Hospitalizations (sub-categorized as elective/non-elective, surgical) were quantified using Medicare claims.Mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models tested associations between baseline discrimination and subsequent odds of hospitalizations per year (0, 1, 2+).The mean baseline discrimination score was 1.7 (SD: 2.2).Over an average 6.5 years (SD: 4.1), 160 participants had at least 1 hospitalization (respectively, 118, 87, and 127 participants had at least 1 nonelective, elective, or surgical hospitalization).Adjusting for age, sex, education, income, depressive symptoms, and medical comorbidity, more experiences of discrimination were associated with higher odds of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] per point higher on discrimination score=1.12,95% CI: 1.03-1.22),and higher odds of nonelective (OR=1.12,95% CI: 1.01-1.24),but not surgical or elective hospitalizations.Drivers of these associations, which may include preventive healthcare avoidance due to discrimination or poor health due to the chronic stress response to discrimination, should be explored.


## INDIGENOUS CULTURAL GENERATIVE ACTS TO REDUCE GENERATIVE MISMATCH AND IMPROVE HEALTH OF ALL GENERATIONS Jordan Lewis, University of Minnesota Medical School, Duluth campus, Duluth, Minnesota, United States

The gerontological literature predominantly focuses on aging-related losses and less on the gifts we acquire as we age.Alaska Native Elders have experienced a lifetime of adversity, which persists today, but they have also remained resilient.One characteristics of successful aging among Alaska Native Elders is their commitment and passion for sharing their teachings with the youth.Generativity is concerned with using personal resources to improve the quality of life for future generations.While not commonly used in gerontological social work research, it is a cultural practice among Indigenous Elders.This decade long study has been exploring the concept of successful aging from an Alaska Native perspective, or what it means to age in a good way in Alaska Native communities.Qualitative, in-depth, interviews have been conducted with 154 Elders representing 20 participating communities across the State of Alaska to explore the concept of successful aging and the role of generativity in the aging process.For this presentation, 108 interviews with Alaska Native Elders explored successful aging.This presentation will highlight the critical role generativity plays in Alaska Native Elders' ability age in a good way, how generativity can be adapted to bridge the generative mismatch happening between generations and support each generation to healthy and meaningful lives.This presentation will also explore innovative and culturally responsive ways to teach the youth about aging in a good way and how families and communities can support their Elders to be meaningful engaged in the rapidly changing families in the Arctic.

## BUILDING BRIDGES TO CONNECT BETWEEN NEEDS, RESOURCES, AND RURAL RESIDENTS

Chair: Nancy Karlin Co-Chair: Lisa Ann Wiese Discussant: Cassandra Ford

The percentage of older adults living in rural areas is predicted to rise with population aging.This impacts access to resources, creates barriers to effective aging, and promotes a unique aging experience.Consequently, demands are growing for services to support healthy aging in rural regions already experiencing healthcare disparities.This symposium will focus on location variations in resource availability, and unique interventions to promote aging in place.In the first and second presentations, researchers report on differences in current service utilization, satisfaction, and perceived future service needs/use among rural versus frontier-residing older adults in Wyoming, and in Nigeria, respectively.In the third presentation, successes and failures of an interdisciplinary approach to increase Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) diagnosis/treatment rates are shared.The fourth group reports the impact of an intergenerational RCT intervention of training older adults in computer literacy and online chair yoga engagement, for decreasing pain levels and cognitive risk.This is a Rural Aging Interest Group Sponsored Symposium.

## CURRENT AND FUTURE SERVICE USE, SATISFACTION, AND NEED FOR SERVICES AS DEFINED BY RURAL AND FRONTIER OLDER ADULTS Nancy Karlin, University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado, United States

This study focused on differences for current service utilization and satisfaction, along with perceived future service use and need for rural versus frontier residing older adults.A sample of older adults (age 65+), stratified using United States government and State of Wyoming definitions for rural (n=70) and frontier (n=72) counties, were interviewed.Frontier respondents reported less education F (1, 141) = 10.19,p = .002,η2 = .068,monthly income F (1, 141) = 17.03, p = .001,η2 = .108with fewer financial resources F (1, 141) = 10.32,p = .002,η2 = .069,experience with technology F (1, 140) = 4.53, p = .035,η2 = .032,and potential for telehealth F (1, 140) = 19.27,p < .001,η2 = .112,along



Findings illustrate how AN communities can support Elders who experience cyclical migration patterns to ensure they age successfully in both locations.Future recommended research should explore cyclical migration patterns among other Indigenous populations with histories of migration.
