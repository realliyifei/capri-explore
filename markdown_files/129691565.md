102010. 2008. 201010.5194/acp-10-11565-2010A wrong data has occured in the published manuscript titled "An overview of the Amazonian Aerosol Characteriza-tion Experiment 2008 (AMAZE-08)". The error has occured in Sect. 2 on page 11417, line 3: "The principal measurement site of AMAZE-08 was tower TT34 (02 • 35.657 S, 060 • 12.557 W, 110 m a.s.l.) (Fig. 1)." 02 • 35.657 S should be corrected as: 02 • 35.675 S. Correspondence to: S. T. Martin Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.
