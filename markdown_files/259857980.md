Re The prescription of psychedelic therapies in Australia and New Zealand: A brief survey of psychiatrists.1We are in favour of psychiatrists knowing more about everything, including about the properties, effects and side effects of psychedelic use, as the authors advocate.As a discipline, we have much yet to learn.However, we do question whether they have made their case appropriately.Firstly, we note that their paper's title indicates that it is a survey of psychiatrists.This infers that their findings refer to specialist psychiatrists of which there are approximately 5600 in Australasia.But their data source was 44 psychiatrists and 14 trainees, so their potential available population would be nearly 8000 once trainee psychiatrists are added.Their opinions were therefore gathered from less than 0:8% of the possible denominator population.

Secondly, there is no information on the potential biases in this small sample.

Thirdly, what the authors share with the potential reader is that of the '44 fully trained psychiatrists and 14 trainees who provided information >65%' (?42 persons) 'agreed' that psychedelic therapies might address the shortfall in available effective psychiatric treatments, even though most considered they were not knowledgeable about these agents.This rather undermines the confidence one might have in even this small sample's expectations of these agents.

Should we regard such survey data as representative of anything?

Recently, Karan et al. (2022) 2 published an analysis of 2019 Queensland CCU benchmarking data, concluding that, despite similar consumer acuity, the staffing models had different treatment approaches.However, this study excluded consumers residing at a CCU <91 days.Therefore, we re-analysed the benchmarking data to explore the possibility of differences in consumer acuity based on the staffing model.

We identified significant differences between staffing models (see Supplementary Tables 3-4).These differences included symptomatic and disability measures (HoNOS and LSP-16), and the likelihood of inpatient referral.Post-hoc analyses found differences between the clinical and integrated staffing groups, with higher total HoNOS and LSP-16 scores and higher levels of inpatient referrals under the clinical than the integrated staffing model.

Our re-analysis suggests that clinical staffing model CCUs may work with consumers experiencing more severe impairment than those operating the integrated staffing model.Significant differences between the consumer profile under the partnership configuration and the other approaches were not identified.Possibly, reduced 24-hour clinical staff availability under the integrated model may limit rehabilitation access for people with the highest support needs.Alternatively, the integrated staffing model may limit these services from being used as a step-down from acute inpatient care.However, many other factors could account for the observed differences that cannot be considered based on the available data.These include systematic bias in ratings of the routine outcome measures between models (i.e., who is completing the HoNOS and LSP-16), different referral patterns, and differences in the broader mental health support system in which the CCUs operate.More research is urgently needed to ensure decisions about the staffing of CCUs are evidence-informed.

## RANZCP elections: What becomes of the disengaged?

Dear Editor, As a membership organisation that is responsible for the accreditation of medical specialist training and ongoing peer review in psychiatry for Australia and New Zealand, the RANZCP needs to represent its members, as well as to uphold standards of medical expertise to serve the healthcare of the community.The effectiveness of the RANZCP as a membership organisation depends on member engagement. 1 An objective and quantitative measure of membership engagement is voter turnout in organisational elections.

We comment regarding the voter turnout of the 2023 RANZCP election for President-Elect.The RANZCP reported that 37% of eligible members voted in 2023, while 35% voted in 2021, and 39.9% in 2019 (college emails).Low voter turnouts occurred despite the RANZCP sending reminders, candidate profiles and other measures to encourage voting.Therefore 63% of members, a clear majority, did not vote for their binational leader, who represents their discipline on the national and international stage, as in previous elections.

Our unsystematic search did not find any research literature on medical specialist college voting, or details on voter turnout for similar elections for other specialist colleges.Acknowledging that general population election voting rates are determined by many more factors than the RANZCP election, it remains apposite to consider that voter turnout of 37% is comparable to the Presidential voter turnout in the lowest ranked countries for voting (105-107), Bulgaria at 38.7%, the Central African Republic at 35.3% and Nigeria at 34.8%. 2 Without assuming that any similar socio-political issues exist, as an objective measure of membership engagement, such a low voter turnout represents very substantial disengagement.

Medico-political organisations, such as specialist medical colleges, like the RANZCP are most effective when members are engaged and active in volunteering.Disengagement means that the RANZCP is less representative of its members views and interests.Disengagement renders such organisations vulnerable to the perils of corporatisation, bureaucratisation and concentration of power. 3erefore, the RANZCP should investigate the member engagement and the reasons for voter disengagement, including:

1. Surveying members anonymously through peer-review groups, sections and faculties as to reasons for voting or notwith the caveat that disengaged members may not respond;

2. Quality audit of the governance of the President-Elect nomination, election campaigning, voting and communication policy
