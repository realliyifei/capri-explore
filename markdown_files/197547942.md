Speleothems from the Middle East: An Example of Water Limited Environments in the SISAL Database Regional Climate Spatial/Temporal Settings ME Time-Series ME Composite SISAL DB Overview

Goals• Highlight the applicability of speleothems from the Middle East (ME) to resolve regional-scale consistencies and inconsistencies between sub-regions (see map). • Test for spatial coherency between ME speleothems and additional climate recorders (i.e. Arctic ice sheets and Mediterranean surface temperatures). • the spatial distribution of carbonate bedrock is not continuous, so without regional continuity, improved entity density would improve regional analysis coherency.Results• High coverage since LGM, highest in Holocene. Median age resolution is ~7 years, varies from seasonal to centennial. • Proxy sensitivity for the Levant is highest in Soreq Cave. Deglaciation timing is not spatially coherent.Holocene values in almost all Levant entities converge, and they coherently record centennial to millennial perturbation.

The ME is divided to three sub-regions:

• Levant/Eastern Mediterranean • Fertile Crescent (FC)

• Arabian Peninsula (AP) -see Scroxton et al.


## Importance of the Middle East

• Climatic Heterogeneity: The transition between temperate Mediterranean climates (Levant) to hyperarid sub-tropical deserts in the southern part of the AP.

• Water-limited: climate projections predict severe drying, making it important to understand the controls of hydro-climate perturbations in the region.

• Quaternary archeological records: bottle-neck for early hominin dispersion out of Africa, "Neolithic Revolution", expansion and subsequent collapse of civilizations in the past.


## Spatial/Temporal Resolution

Home FWD Back 17 ME speleothem stable oxygen isotope (δ 18 Occ) records from 10 sites from the SISAL_v1 database.

These entities provide a record of past hydro-climatic variability for the last 300 ka.

The review focuses on the last~22 ka BP since the Last Glacial Maximum, with emphasis on Holocene major climate events -8.2ka, 4.2ka and 0.7ka. 


## ka

-Timing: the event in the composite is in agreement with NGIP composite, peak δ 18 O of EM marine record, sum of dry and cold periods and a minor glacial advance. -Amplitude: minimal in the composite -due to spatial coherence between samples evident from the large normalized-SD boxes. -Post-event 25y trendline suggests regional drying -in agreement with the end of sapropel 1 and the African humid period. 4.2 ka -Convergence: the signal appears as a coherent trough in the composite defining a maximum regional drying. Caution is required as multiple entities show gaps during this period. -Increase the temporal coverage and generate longer timeseries from the region.

As most of the records cover only the last 40-30 ka -Application of high temporal-resolution analysis methodologies.

To increase the resolution and resolve seasonal bias of the available geological paleorecords


## SISAL outlook for the Middle East

Numerous identified entities, which are still not incorporated in SISAL, suggest an excellent opportunity for the database.

Current efforts to upload new time-series would improve on existing application of tempo-spatial statistical analyses. E.g. synthesis and standardization techniques and Monte Carlo Principal Component coherence analysis (Deininger et al., 2016) Speleothems from the Middle East


## The Regional Multi-Record δ 18 Occ Composite

The available speleothem stable oxygen isotope ratio.

Holocene time-series are investigated via binning and normalizing (providing median, the 25th and 75th quantiles of the data) at 25year and 200-year time windows.

This methodology was previously used in the context of the PAGES 2k databases. Groups are temporary organizations that bring paleo-scientists together to target specific aspects of PAGES scientific agenda that cannot be addressed by a single team.


## Why speleothems?

 Good temporal coverage ( U/Th up to c. 600.000 years) → Potential to cover PMIP4 key periods.

 Well distributed globally. This product is designed for:

• Exploring regional and globalscale past changes in the hydrological cycle.

• Evaluating isotope-enabled climate simulations of the past. Sites identified but currently not in SISAL_v1 (see Figure 1)

-Could be resolved in by adding FC records (see idenified list) bin (box plot) / 25y-bin (running mean line) 2 ka (Late-Holocene cycles and Little Ice Age ) -Overall: Suggest leveling or change in the drying trend prevalent since 8.2 ka in the speleothem composite. -Timing: A long-term wet-dry cycle from ~2.5 ka is visible on the 25y mean, with a wet peak identifying the LIA. -Industrial: Large variability between records, minor drying trend since LIA → "too soon to tell" in 200y/25y resolution. -FC entities: Will help increase fidelity of the regional trend (e.g. Flohr et al., 2017).From a Holocene point of view -The speleothem composite provides a sensitive outlook on the last millennia (25y), while highlighting the regional heterogeneity (200y).Summary and Future ProspectsHome BackEmphasis for future speleothem research in the Middle East-Increase spatial coverage in the region.Specifically in the Fertile Crescent, Arabian Peninsula and Saharan belt where current site density is considerably lower than the Levant and the interplay of Atlantic-Mediterranean vs. ITCZ requires further investigation.


Additional six sites from Eastern Europe and Northern Turkey (seeKern  et al. 2019) are included here, as these sites are along the dominant Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EM) storm tracks.Speleothems from the Middle East

Controls on δ 18 Occ 

• Millennial/glacial scale variability in 
δ 18 Occ (long wavelength) is linked to the 
Mediterranean vapor source ("source 
effect", compared to marine δ 18 O). 

• Centennial / decadal (medium 
wavelength) variability is linked to the 
change in rainfall amount (high effective 
rainfall = low δ 18 Occ) superimposed on 
small scale changes in EM surface water 
(e.g. increased Nile flux) 

• Seasonal (where available) -evidence of 
mixing between light δ 18 O winter influx 
and the pore reservoir.

Observations 

LGM and deglaciation 
-Sensitivity: Soreq is the only Levant Cave 
which records variations between 30 ka and 
BA. Other records have lower temporal resolution. 
-Proxy signature: During the glacial absolute 
δ 18 Occ varies ~2‰ between sites and 
entities. 
-Deglaciation: The deglaciation slope is 
different between the various Levant records 

The deglaciation starts early in Soreq, and last in JWC 
which shows the sharpest slope. 

Holocene 
-Sensitivity: Most records resolve millennial to 
centennial events at a similar tempo and 
amplitude. 
-Proxy signature: Post-YD, the absolute δ 18 Occ 
of Levant records is remarkably similar.
