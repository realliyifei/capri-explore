Peste-des-petits-ruminants (PPR) is a notifiable, contagious and economically important transboundary viral disease of small ruminant causing high morbidity and mortality.It belongs to negative-sense, single-stranded RNA paramyxovirus of genus Morbillivirus.PPR occurs in populations of immunologically naive sheep and goats, illness and death can be high as >90%.The virus is commonly found in developing countries, especially in tropical countries where the disease is widespread.After the eradication of the rinderpest virus, which is closely relate to PPRV of small ruminants contaminated with SRMV are diagnosed having pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharges, necrotizing and erosive stomatitis, gastroenteritis, diarrhea and broncho pneumonia, whereas, gross pathology, histological findings along with laboratory confirmation of specific virus antigen, antibodies, genome in the clinical samples through a variety of serological and molecular diagnostic tests can be useful.In addition there should be social economic surveys, disease hot spot recognition and identification of role of additional species in disease transmission.SRMV control may be achieved by confinement of contaminated animals, subtraction of theoretically tainted fomites with control at import and export of sheep with goats from contaminated areas.PPR can be controlled through mass vaccination program.In the future, the preparation of a marker vaccine with a robust companion test may assist in serosurveillance for the detection of infection in vaccinated animals to control the disease.

## Introduction

Peste des petits ruminants (PPRVirus) is quick spreading viral disease that affects sheep and goat.Goats may be more severely affected than sheep by PPRV infection [1].During the acute stage of disease, animals show pyrexia (40 -42 0 C), despair, ulcers, vesicles erosion lying on tongue, smack its lips lacrimation, serous nasal discharge, abnormal breathing with coughing foulsmelling diarrhea and finally death [2].In severe cases mortality and morbidity may ranges from 90 to 100% [3].Clinical

West African goats have been found to be more susceptible than European, and within the former group, the kids are more susceptible to the disease [22].Cattle and pigs might be carrier to the virus without any clinical signs [23, 24].It has been reported that the camels can be seroconvert to the PPRV [25].Recent observations in Sudan suggested that the camels could be affected by PPR as they can show clinical expression of the disease and positive results were detected by serological tests that include RT-PCR and cell culture [26, 27].In one study, antibodies against PPR were detected in 3 % of the 628 tested camels in Ethiopia [28].Moreover, PPR is contagious due to the nature of the spread of the disease from kids to adult goats.Virus was inoculated from sheep to sheep and goats by using crude tissue material and tissue culture isolated from animals that died from Kata and SPC.Disease was transmitted through two passages in goats followed by one passage in cell culture then another one in goats [35, 36].

History In the early 1940's, it was a fatal disease of small ruminants with high mortality, first defined as Peste-des-petits-ruminants (PPR) in the Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire) in West Africa [7]. Similar syndrome was described in Dahomy (Benin) by Cathou (1944) under the name of "Peste des especes ovine etcaprine". The disease has been reported in Senegal and Ghana [8]. Furthermore, PPR Virus was initially isolated in Senegal in 1962 [9]. During 1950 a disease that affected mostly sheep [21]. Transmissiondistemper virus, Phocid morbilliviruses and Porpoise distemper virus [15]. These viruses share the similar genome association though ribonucleic acid (RNA) [16]. The morbilliviruses are a closely associated group of important human and animal pathogenic viruses [5]. Morbillivirus is a non-segmented, distinct strand, pleomorphic, negative sense RNA virus measuring 200nm in diameter [17]. PPR is one of the longest sequenced Morbillivirus genomes comprising of 16 kilo base pairs [18]. Geographical distribution PPR has progressively expanded to cover large regions in Africa, Southern Africa, Arabian Peninsula, Middle East and Asia. syndrome SPC (Stomatitis pneumo-enteritis complex) could pass from goat to goat by contact or by inoculation of susceptible goats with the infectious agent. They also reported that the disease could not be transmitted to cattle and rabbits inoculated via subcutaneous and cerebral routes [34].goats, was studied in Nigeria by Johnson and Natural transmissionPPRV was first reported in 1942 (Ivory Pigs can be infected with PPRV byRitchie in 1968.

Different control and preventive strategies can be used.At very first stage, separate the diseased animals from healthy animals to minimize the casual of transmission of PPR virus from diseased animals to healthy animals.Secondly slaughtering of apparent diseases animals and seropositive animals [67].Furthermore, vaccination of animals is a good option to minimize the risk of incidence in healthy animal population [68].Worldwide different immunization strategies against PPR has been used i.e. earlier immunization of small ruminants was done with lymph node and spleen materials containing contagious virus inactivated with 1.5-5 % chloroform, attenuated tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (TCRV) but now PPR homologous vaccine is available which is prepared by a new freeze-drying process and addition of stabilizing agents [69].Conclusion Peste des petits ruminants is a severe, highly infectious and fatal viral disease of small ruminants all around the world including Pakistan and generally circulated in sheep and goat rearing areas.PPR transmission occurs through contact with infected animals.Goats are more susceptible than sheep.Clinical signs of PPR should be confirmed by laboratory testing.Vaccination of animals against PPR has a positive impact to control virus outbreak in the country.Thus, Mass vaccination program should be carried out in affected areas to reduce the PPR infection among sheep and goats.
even in advanced cases particularly iftreatment is started early [64].Clinical cases of PPR disease in goats arepreferably treated symptomatically by the useof broad spectrum antibiotics, intestinalsedatives and fluid therapy to treatpneumonia, diarrhoea and restore body fluidionic balance [63]. Goats are treated withnorfloxacin together with oral and i/v-gri/96, which areadministration of electrolytes and a liverattenuated over serial passages in Vero cellsdetoxifying agent [65]. It was also observed[54]. The vaccines have been demonstrated tothat management of hyperimmune serum tobe highly effective and are suggested toanimals incubating the disease or in the earlyprovide lifelong immunity in both sheep andstages of the disease before the start ofgoats. These popular vaccines are used indiarrhea resulted in safety and recovery [66].many PPRV endemic countries [55]. ThoughControl and preventionuntil now no vaccine is available that canserologically distinguish vaccinated animalsfrom diseased ones, a so calledDifferentiating Infected from VaccinatedAnimals (DIVA) vaccine [56]. The availablePPR vaccines do not support the DIVAprinciple. Possible DIVA vaccines based onrecombinant viruses are good vaccinecandidates. One vaccine based onrecombinant adenoviruses has shown to bepromising but has not undergone extensive orlong term testing [57]. Thermo stablevaccines and other strategies for improvingthe stability of PPR vaccines are under study[58]. Some research has been done onsynthetic short interfering RNAs (siRNAs)which might kill the virus while preservingthe serological status of treated animals [59].TreatmentThere is no treatment for PPR but mortalityrates may be decreased by use of broadspectrum antibiotics and antiparasiticides.Oxytetracycline and Chlortetracycline aresuggested to inhibit secondary pulmonaryinfections [62]. Supportive care includingfluid therapy can also decrease deaths due todehydration and subsequent electrolyteimbalance [63]. Clinical cases of acute PPRcan be adequately and successfully treated
