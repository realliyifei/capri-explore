Thus far, several small studies and case reports on the use of topical immunomodulators in vitiligo have been published. We undertook a comprehensive literature review, searching for studies evaluating clinical response to tacrolimus topical therapy for vitiligo. A search was performed on PubMed/Medline using the term "vitiligo", combined with "topical" and "ointment". Our inclusion criteria were: use of tacrolimus ointment as monotherapy to treat vitiligo. We found 29 studies from 2002 to 2014. Overall, 709 patients were treated in 29 studies. Pooling the lesions, 50% repigmentation of vitiligo patches was never achieved before 2 months of treatment, with a peak after 6 months of therapy. The best results were obtained on lesions of the cephalic region, especially the face, with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment two times daily. The percentage of non-responsive patients ranged from 0% to 14%. Treatment was generally well-tolerated; only localized adverse effects were reported. Our objective was to verify the effectiveness and safety of tacrolimus ointment monotherapy. It has good efficacy and tolerability. At present, only small trials and case series are available in the literature. Further, standardized investigations on a larger number of patients are needed.

## INTRODUCTION

Vitiligo is characterized by the progressive disappearance of melanocytes, resulting in depigmentation of the skin and/or hair. The etiology of vitiligo is unknown. 1 Genetic studies support a non-Mendelian inheritance, suggesting that vitiligo is a multifactorial, polygenic disorder. The autoimmune theory remains the most widely accepted. Vitiligo has frequently been reported in association with autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus and alopecia areata.

Several studies have suggested that the presence of increased antimelanocyte antibodies and the imbalance of T-cell (CD4+/CD8+ and Tregs) subsets, along with their functional defects, may result in melanocyte destruction in vitiligo patients. 2 The disease affects both genders equally. It can appear at any age and the average age of onset is somewhat variable in different geographic regions. The mean onset age is reportedly 22 in the U.S. and India, 24 in Brazil and 25 in the UK. 3 Vitiligo treatment remains a challenge. Therapeutic options for vitiligo include: topical and systemic corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriol, phototherapy, excimer laser, and surgical methods such as skin⁄single-hair grafting, autologous cultured melanocyte or epidermal suspension transplantations.

Topical corticosteroids are most commonly used drug to treat vitiligo but there are concerns over side effects due to long-term use. Steroid application causes skin atrophy, telangiectasia, hypertrichosis and acne.

Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are used as topical immunomodulators. They inhibit calcineurin action, thus preventing T-cell activation and the production of various inflammatory cytokines.

Both have been used to treat other inflammatory and immunologic skin disorders, including vitiligo, with encouraging results. 4,5 Tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis with strong T-specific, immunosuppressant activity. The biological activity of tacrolimus takes effect after binding to the cytosolic 12kd macrophilin FK506 binding protein (FK-BP). The tacrolimus/FK-BP complex inhibits calcineurin-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor, the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). Hence, the expression of several inflammatory T-cell cytokines is inhibited. Indeed, topical tacrolimus downregulates proinflammatory cytokines, namely IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-c, TNF-a and granulocyte-stimulating factors. Lan et al. 6 reported that the proliferation of melanocytes was significantly enhanced by tacrolimus-treated keratinocyte supernatant. Further, they noted that the concentration of stem-cell factor and matrix metallopeptidase-9 activity in tacrolimus-treated keratinocyte supernatant increased significantly. They suggested that their results provided in vitro evidence demonstrating the positive effect of tacrolimus on melanocyte growth and migration.

Thus far, several small studies and case reports on the use of topical immunomodulators in vitiligo have been published.


## METHODS

To verify the effectiveness of tacrolimus alone, we selected studies that discussed tacrolimus ointment as monotherapy for vitiligo treatment.

A literature search on Medline/PubMed was performed for articles evaluating clinical response using tacrolimus as topical therapy for vitiligo. The keywords were: "vitiligo" combined with "topical" and "ointment".

Inclusion criteria were: 1) case study, review of literature, case report, clinical trial, open-label prospective study 2) tacrolimus used as monotherapy. The exclusion criterion was tacrolimus as a combination therapy.

The entire PubMed database was explored, without time restrictions. Each article was tabulated as follows: authors, year of study, type of study, number of patients, age (in years) and sex of patients, localization of disease, treatment protocol, adverse effects, outcome.

Studies discussing children and adults were included, along with studies describing topical treatment with both tacrolimus ointment 0.03% and tacrolimus ointment 0.1% . English and non-English-language papers were included.

The publications were screened manually and reviewed to identify reports on tacrolimus monotherapy. Three investigators independently reviewed and extracted data from the papers according to the predetermined criteria.


## RESULTS

We identified 117 full-text articles; 88 did not meet the inclusion criteria, leaving 29 studies available from 2002 to 2014. Nineteen were open-label trials, 3 were retrospective cohorts, 6 were case reports and 1 was a case series (Chart 1).

Overall, the treatments of 709 patients were described in 29 studies. The main treatment choice was tacrolimus ointment 0.1%, applied twice daily (19/29 studies, 65%) and once daily in 7 studies. Six studies examined treatment with tacrolimus 0.03% once daily. [7][8][9][10][11][12] Treatment length was variable, with a mean duration of 5.2 months (ranging from 2 to 18 months). All patients were advised to use sunscreen regularly and avoid intentional sun exposure during the day.

Response rates also varied. Pooling the lesions, 50% repigmentation of vitiligo patches was never achieved before 2 months of vitiligo treatment, with a peak after 6 months of therapy. 13 In all responder-patients undergoing treatment regimens, at least 50% repigmentation was achieved after 6 months of therapy. The best results were obtained on lesions in the cephalic regions, especially the face, applying tacrolimus ointment twice daily. [14][15][16] The percentage of non-responsive patients ranged from 0% to 14%. Only Kathuria et al. reported unsatisfactory results and limitations to the drug, with 50% repigmentation after 6 months of therapy in 5.3% of patients. 17 Treatment was generally well-tolerated; no adverse systemic effects were reported. The most frequent adverse effects were burning sensation and pruritus, local erythema or irritation, acne or folliculitis-like manifestations, dysesthesia, stinging, pickling, formication and soreness. 7,14,15,[18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] 


## DISCUSSION

Our review aimed to critically assess the studies evaluating monotherapy with tacrolimus ointment to treat vitiligo.

Selection bias and a lack of common outcome measures were among the issues that prevented a proper meta-analysis. Although this review is not a meta-analysis, we critically assessed the literature and tried to identify high-quality studies.

The main limits of this analysis are the low number of patients included in most studies and the high heterogeneity of the study populations. Nevertheless, the studies analyzed as a whole seem to show that tacrolimus ointment provides effective treatment. Substantial repigmentation of lesions (>50%) requires time and consistent application of the product, at least 2-3 months depending on the patient's age and race. 28,29,30 Treatment with topical tacrolimus is generally There was some perifollicular repigmentation in most of the other vitiligo lesions. After 9 months, 38% of lesions on the tacrolimus-treated side on the trunk showed repigmentation.

Four patients showed moderate to excellent repigmentation.

Partial repigmentation 71% of patients.

No repigmentation 14% of patients.

CONTINUED CONTINUATION safe and free of major local side effects. No serious adverse events occurred that required treatment to be stopped. In a single study, erythema and folliculitis-like manifestations on the treated area led 2 patients to discontinue therapy with tacrolimus ointment 0.1% twice a day. 26 In the open, randomized trial conducted by Stinco et al. 15 (total of 12 patients, age range 30-61, treatment with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice daily), 9 patients described a heat sensation on the face during the first days of application. One female patient related the appearance of soreness; another female patient reported pruritus on the eyelids associated with formication of the lips, while one female patient presented erythema of the bulbar conjunctiva. Five patients described redflushing on their faces after consuming small amounts of alcohol (a glass of beer or wine). All local side effects resolved within 2-3 weeks after the topical treatment regimen was reduced from two daily applications to one daily application.

Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment has been reserved for children <16 years and associated with hyperpigmentation, as well as hypertricosis, in the target area. 12,10,31 In In adult patients, treatment with tacrolimus 0.03% yielded similar results to tacrolimus ointment 0.1%.

Although tacrolimus monotherapy seems to have good efficacy and tolerability, only small trials and case series are available in the literature . 32,33,34,35 The largest study ever published in terms of the number of patients enrolled, only included 90 patients. 11 Hence, further, standardized investigations on a greater number of patients are needed.q

Adverse effects 

Nine patients, 7 female and 2 male, 
described a heat sensation on the face 
during the first days of application; in 
one case the application of the ointment 
was reduced to once a day for two weeks, 
leading to disappearance of the symp-
toms. One female patient related 
soreness; 1 female patient reported 
pruritus on the eyelids associated with 
formication of the lips, and 1 female 

patient presented erythema of the bulbar 
conjunctiva. Five patients described the 
appearance of redflushing on their face af-

ter consuming a small amount of alcohol 
(a glass of beer or wine). All side effects 
resolved within 2-3 weeks. 

15 adverse events : 
namely acne in one, pruritus in five, 
dysesthesia in six 

and stinging in three. 
Adverse events were observed in 28.6% 

of adult patients and 15% of children. 
These included burning sensation and 
erythema. 
Folliculitis 

Outcome 
Twice-daily treatment for 6 months induced 

some repigmentation in 10 out of 15 (67%) 
lesions. 
Once-daily application of tacrolimus result-

ed in some repigmentation in 7 out of 15 
(46%) lesions. 
treatment outcome was calculated for 

each anatomical site according to a scale 
ranging from 0 to 4 and classified as 
"absent" , " poor" (1-25%), "moderate" 
(26-50%), "good" (51-75%), and "excellent" 

(> 75%). 
All treated patients with vitiligo lesions 
localized on the face, neck and upper limbs 
obtained a variable repigmentation, from 

poor to excellent; for the other anatomical 
sites (hands/wrists, trunk and upper and 
feet/ankles) cases of lack of repigmentation 

were recorded. The only patient with lesions 
on the feet/ankles showed no signs of repig-
mentation. 

The best results of repigmentation were 
obtained for the face , followed by the neck, 
upper limbs and trunk and lower limbs, 
hands/wrists. 

We noted that although 28.3% of the pa-
tients showed no response at week 4, all of 
them showed variable degrees of repigmen-
tation at week 12. 
The overall response rate, defined as at least 
some repigmentation, was 76.09%. 
Successful response was defined as repig-
mentation of > 50%.

Localization 

Sixty-six patients had viti-

ligo lesions on the body, 65 
patients on the face 
Thirty-seven patients had 

1% of body surface area 
involved, followed by 11 pa-

tients with 2% involvement. 
Also, 3 and 4% of body 
surface area was involved 

in four and three patients, 
respectively. In 32 patients, 

single region was affected; 

20 patients had lesions on 
the face, especially the lips, 
eyelids, and ears. 
Face, neck and limbs 
Scalp, periorbital regions, 
elbows, thighs, legs, and feet 
Depigmented lesions on the 

face, trunk, and extremities

daily 2 months 
Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment 

twice daily with overnight 
hydrocolloid dressing 
Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% 

Twice a day 

36 weeks (9 months) 

Adverse effects 

Mild burning (2 patients) 
Hyperpigmentation over the periorbital 

macules. 
Initial mild prickling 
Erythema and folliculitis-like manifesta-

tions (2 patients discontinued the therapy 
because of side effects). 

Outcome 
Repigmentation was good in all patients. 

More than 75% repigmentation of body 
lesions was noted in 62.5% of subjects with 
Fizpatrick types 3-4, compared with only 

33.3 percent of Fizpatrick 1-2 and 21.7% of 
Fitzpatrick 5-6. 

Of the 55 patients, 36 showed response to 
treatment and 19 showed no response after 

3 months. 
Extremities and chest >50% repigmentation 

in 27% of cases. 
Six patients with lesions on the cephalic 
region showed >75% of repigmentation. 
Only 5.3% patients with tacrolimus 
had >50% repigmentation, showing the 
limitation of the drug.
