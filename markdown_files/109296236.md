carcasses for presence of Cysticercus bovis. The cultural aspects of a certain community towards cooking and eating habits are some of the factors responsible for the spread of T. saginata infections. This unhygienic practice by the population of the country has a great contribution to the spread of bovine cysticercosis in the communities. In Ethiopia, human tapeworm is a common infection linked to the common practice of eating raw or undercooked beef in many sections of the country's human population. Blind defecation, due to the lack of latrines, is a common practice, especially in the rural community of Ethiopia where more than 80% of the population resides. The traditional farming practices common in Ethiopia (free grazing of cattle) mainly allow the free access of cattle to the contaminated environment and perpetuate the transmission of cysticercosis, since cattle are infected by the ingestion of pasture / feed for animals or water contaminated with T. saginata eggs. The prevalence of human taeniasis due to T. saginata was reported in different regions of Ethiopia with range of 27.5% [12] to 70% based on questioner survey. T. saginata/C. bovis prevalence has been recorded from different regions and charted cities of Ethiopia: at Addis Ababa abattoir by Kebede et al.; in Southern Ethiopia by Regassa et al. , Northern Ethiopia by Getachew and Getachew and Ashiwani ; in Awassa municipal abattoir (Southern Nations' Nationalities' Peoples' Region) by Abunna et al. , in northwestern Ethiopia by Kebede. The questioner based survey revealed a higher prevalence of T. saginata infection than the hospital based studies, however questioner based survey result did not show the actual infection in the community. The hospital based studies are important to estimate the actual prevalence of T. saginata infection in the community. Moreover, patients who visited referral hospital came from different districts of north showa zone, in the central region of Ethiopia, our hospital based study may provide insight in to the region-wide distribution of T. saginata as well as other epidemiological data. Obtaining epidemiological data of a certain disease is essential before planning and implementation of control programs. Information resulting from hospital records has been taken as useful sources of data for the study of the actual distribution and epidemiological aspect of T. saginata. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of bovine cysticercosis and cyst characterization in view of its public health implication in the study abattoir and another objective was to evaluate the prevalence and possible trends of human T. saginata in and around Debre Birhan town based on hospital data over a period of 5 years [19].
