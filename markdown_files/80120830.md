Hormone therapy (HT) is the most effective treatment for menopause-related VMS. 1-4 It also prevents postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures including spinal and non-spinal fractures. HT is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of osteoporosis and for relief from VMS and vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) associated with menopause. 2,5 In women with an intact uterus who show perimenopausal symptoms, estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) is recommended because systemic estrogen-only therapy (ET) is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, hyperplasia, and irregular bleeding. 1,2,6,7 EPT is effective in the management of climacteric symptoms; however, it is associated with safety and tolerability concerns. 8 Randomized controlled trials by the WHI have revealed that EPT is associated with a high incidence of breast cancer and mortality. 3,9 On the contrary, a lower incidence of breast cancer was observed in postmenopausal women who had undergone hysterectomy and were using ET (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% confidential interval [CI], 0.62-0.95). 10Additionally, the incidence of coronary heart dis-Hormone therapy (HT) is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, and reduces both spinal and non-spinal postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures. However, a Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial revealed that progestin-containing HT is associated with higher incidences of breast cancer and coronary heart disease than those associated with placebo. Tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC) is a novel progestin-free HT option composed of conjugated estrogens (CE) and a selective estrogen receptor modulator. CE at a dose of 0.45 ㎎ combined with 20 ㎎ of bazedoxifene was the first TSEC medication approved in the United States and Korea for women with moderate to severe menopause-related vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and for preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis. This review summarizes the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TSEC as obtained from the five SMART clinical trials.

6 ease (CHD) significantly increased by 29% in women taking EPT compared to that in women in the placebo group. 3 However, the use of systemic ET did not increase the incidence of CHD in postmenopausal women who had undergone hysterectomy (HR, 0.91, 95% CI, 0.75-1.12). 11 Therefore, there has been a need for progestin-free treatment options with clinically proven efficacies and good safety profiles, which can protect the endometrium from negative estrogenic effects. 12 TSEC combines a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with one or more CE. TESC is a new approach to treating menopausal symptoms and postmenopausal osteoporosis, and is an alternative to EPT, that can be used to treat women with an intact uterus. 8,13 SERMs are compounds that act as estrogen receptor (ER) agonists in some tissues and as antagonists in others. Different SERMs provide different tissue-specific actions with varying levels of agonist and antagonist activities. 2,13 Bazedoxifene (BZA) is a third-generation SERM that is approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in Europe (Conbriza®) and Korea (Viviant®). BZA has shown favorable preclinical effects on the skeleton, in VMS, and on lipid profiles. BZA also helps to maintain mammary and uterine safety. 12,14 The rationale for selecting BZA as the SERM in TSEC is that BZA can offset the estrogenic stimulation of endometrial and breast tissues without the need for progestin. This is particularly useful for menopausal women with an intact uterus, without aggravating VMS. 15 Several preclinical studies have demonstrated that BZA effectively negates the adverse estrogenic effects of CE on the endometrium and the breast. [16][17][18][19][20] SMART trials, which consist of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-and active-controlled phase 3 trials, were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of CE/BZA in postmenopausal women with a uterus (

(4) Women with increased breast density on mammograms, which may impede mammographic detection of breast cancer.  12 have suggested that women in group (5) should be advised that data on the long-term effects of BZA/CE on the risk of developing breast cancer are not currently available. 


## CONCLUSION


the SMART-1 trial, a dose-related attenuation of the beneficial estrogenic effect on vaginal atrophy with increasing doses of BZA was observed. 21 Treatment with BZA (20 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) was significantly more effective in increasing the mean proportion of superficial and intermediate cells from baseline at most time points, while the mean proportion of parabasal cells decreased. Additionally, there was a significantly lower incidence of dyspareunia with BZA (20 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) during weeks 9 to 12. In the SMART-3 randomized trial, a total of 664 postmenopausal women aged 40-effects of the placebo. Improvements in vaginal dryness were also observed with both BZA/CE doses. In addition, treatment with BZA (20 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) for 12 weeks was shown to significantly improve sexual function and quality-of-life measures in symptomatic postmenopausal women. 28 However, the most bothersome symptoms and vaginal pH significantly improved with BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.625 ㎎, but not with BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.45 ㎎, compared with the effects associated with the placebo. BZA/CE has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of VVA in postmenopausal women. 29 4. BONE The SMART-1 trial included two substudies on osteoporosis: the Osteoporosis Prevention Ⅰ Substudy (substudy Ⅰ), and the Osteoporosis Prevention Ⅱ and Metabolic Substudy (substudy II). Substudy Ⅰ examined women at 40 international sites, who were postmenopausal for more than 5 years. On the other hand, substudy II involved women enrolled at 25 international sites, who were 1-5 years postmenopausal. 30 All participants were randomly assigned to one of eight treatment groups: BZA (10, 20, or 40 ㎎) with CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎), raloxifene (60 ㎎), or placebo. In both substudies, bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and total hip increased more significantly at all the BZA/CE doses compared with that achieved with the placebo. However, BMD at the lumbar spine increased more significantly for most BZA/CE doses compared with the effects associated with raloxifene. 30 Improvements in lumbar spine BMD were also significantly greater with all BZA/CE treatments than with the placebo at months 12 and 24. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the bone turnover markers (BTMs), osteocalcin and N-telopeptide. The BTMs decreased with all the doses of BZA/CE compared with those with the placebo, and with most of the BZA/CE doses compared to those of raloxifene.CE and BZA protect against loss of BMD in postmenopausal women when administered separately.29 


74) for CHD. The results suggested that CE 0.45 ㎎/BZA 20 ㎎ and CE 0.625 ㎎/BZA 20 ㎎ demonstrated a better cardiovascular safety profile for up to 2 years compared with that of the placebo, in generally healthy postmenopausal women. Changes in body weight in all the CE/BZA groups were small and not statistically different from those observed in the placebo group. 35 3. BREAST SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY An ancillary retrospective study in a subset of non-hysterectomized postmenopausal women enrolled in the SMART-1 trial showed that treatment with BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.45 ㎎ or BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.625 ㎎ for 24 months did not affect mammographic breast density. 36 In the SMART-5 study, BZA/CE demonstrated non-inferiority compared with that of the placebo for changes in breast density. 37 Mean mammographic breast density over one year decreased from baseline with BZA 20 ㎎/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) compared with that of the placebo (0.44%). On the other hand, CE 0.45 ㎎/MPA 1.5 ㎎ significantly increased breast density (1.60%) from the baseline compared with the effect associated with the placebo. . 37 The incidence of breast tenderness in the BZA/CE groups was similar to that in the placebo group, but significantly lower than that in the CE/MPA group in the SMART-4 and SMART-5 trials, respectively. 31,33,37 4. OTHER SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY CONCERNS Treatment with BZA (20 or 40 ㎎) or with CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) was associated with a lower incidence of bleeding or spotting events compared with that observed with the placebo. The studies also indicated that the cumulative amenorrhea profiles for subjects treated with BZA (20 or 40 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) were similar to those of subjects in the placebo group. 38 Only treatment with BZA 10 ㎎/CE 0.625 ㎎ was reported to be associated with slightly lower cumulative amenorrhea rates than those associated with the placebo during the first year of the trials. There was also a small but significantly higher incidence of bleeding or spotting events observed in patients who received BZA (10 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) than in those who received the placebo. In the SMART-5 trial, subjects treated with BZA (20 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) had cumulative amenorrhea rates similar to those who received the placebo. The cumulative amenorrhea rates were, , those treated with BZA 20 ㎎, or those in the placebo group. Treatment with BZA/CE showed largely beneficial or no effects on lipids and coagulation markers. 29 Pooled analysis of three SMART trials (SMART-1, -4, and -5) showed that there was a significant improvement in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). At 12 and 24 months, treatment with BZA/CE had resulted in significant reductions from baseline in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and the LDL-C/ HDL-C ratio compared with the effect associated with the placebo. 39 In the SMART-5 trial, BZA 20 ㎎/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) treatments were associated with small but significant effects on hemostatic variables including reductions in antithrombin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and fibrinogen activity.


TSEC is an effective and well-tolerated progestin-free alternative to conventional EPT. It is used for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS in postmenopausal women who have not undergone hysterectomy. TSEC is also used for the prevention of osteoporosis in such women. It has acceptable endometrial, breast, cardiovascular, and overall safety and tolerability profiles. BZA/CE may be the appropriate treatment of choice for symptomatic postmenopausal women who cannot tolerate the side effects of progestin. BZA/CE can also be given to women who decline EPT due to concerns about an increased risk of breast cancer development. However, long-term studies on the safety of BZA/CE treatment, including those on the risks for developing cardiovascular diseases and VTE due to the treatment need to be conducted. In addition, further comparative randomized controlled trials on the differences in efficacies of BZA/CE and EPT treatments are needed, in order to make selection of the more appropriate treatment easier.

## Table 1 )
1. From these trials, CE 0.45 ㎎/BZA 20 ㎎ became the first TSEC to be approved in the United States (Duavee®), the Europe Union, and Korea (Duavive®). 12 This review summarizes the current knowledge of the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TSEC published from the five SMART trials. CLINICAL EFFICACY OF BZA/CE IN SMART TRIALS 1. HOT FLUSHES A total of 3,397 healthy, postmenopausal women aged 40 to 75 years with an intact uterus were enrolled in the SMART-1 trial. Analysis of the SMART-1 trial showed that all the BZA (10, 20, or 40 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) doses provided significant relief from moderate and severe hot flushes compared to that provided by the placebo at most time points. 21 At week 12, the adjusted mean percentage reduction in the average daily number of hot flushes was 51.7-85.7% from baseline in the BZA/CE treatment group, while that for the placebo-and raloxifene-treatment groups were 17.1% and 44.1% respectively. However, the Clinical Efficacy and Safety of TSEC decrease in the daily number of hot flushes re ported with BZA (40 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) was not as significant as that noted with BZA (10 or 20 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) at most time points. In the SMART-2 trial, postmenopausal women with moderate to severe hot flushes (≥ 7/day or 50/week) were randomized to BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.45 ㎎, BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.625 ㎎, or placebo, once daily for 12 weeks. 22 Compared with the placebo, both doses of CE/BZA resulted in a significant reduction in the number and severity of hot flushes at weeks 4 and 12 (P < 0.001) from baseline. Treatment with 20 ㎎/CE 0.45 ㎎ BZA and 20 ㎎/CE 0.625 ㎎ BZA reduced the mean daily number of hot flushes from baseline by 74% and 80%, respectively, at week 12, compared with a 51% reduction for the placebo. In addition, both doses of BZA/CE reduced the mean daily severity score of hot flushes from baseline by 38% and 52%, respectively, at week 12 compared with a 17% reduction for the placebo. A significant reduction in the number and severity of hot flushes was observed during weeks 3 to 12 in both BZA/CE groups compared with those of the placebo. scale. 22 Participants treated with BZA/CE had significant improvements in individual and total MENQOL scores from baseline. The sleep/HRQoL substudy of the SMART-5 trial revealed that the BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.625 ㎎ group showed significant improvement in total MENQOL scores compared with those of the placebo at 3 and 12 months,whereas the BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.45 ㎎ group showed significant improvements at 12 months only.25 7 




1 trial, higher doses of CE com-bined with BZA resulted in increases in lumbar 

spine BMD. However, it was observed that TSEC 

with higher doses of BZA resulted in decrease in 

lumbar spine BMD. In the SMART-5 trial, increase 

in lumbar spine BMD as a result of treatment with 

CE 0.45 ㎎/MPA 1.5 ㎎ was significantly greater 

than that for BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.45 ㎎ at 12 months. 31 

CE is a more potent antiresorptive agent than BZA. 

The authors therefore suggested that attenuation 

of BMD responses should be expected if BZA is 

given together with CE, since both drugs bind to 

the same receptor. 31 

CLINICAL SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF 

CE/BZA IN THE SMART TRIALS 
1. ENDOMETRIAL SAFETY 

The SMART-1 trial included a 24-month fol-

low-up period. During this period, BZA 20 ㎎ 

proved to be the least efficacious in the pre-

vention of endometrial hyperplasia, when it was 

administered together with CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎). 32 

Over the 24 months, the incidence of endometrial 

hyperplasia due to BZA (20 or 40 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 

0.62 ㎎) was < 1%, which was within the predefined 

acceptable limit of ≤ 2%. However, the results 

were not significantly different from those ob-

tained with the placebo. On the contrary, the in-

cidence rate of endometrial hyperplasia at month 

24 was 7.14% with 10 ㎎/CE 0.625 ㎎ BZA and 

2.53% with 10 ㎎/CE 0.45 ㎎ BZA.32 Additionally, 

endometrial thickness with BZA (20 or 40 ㎎)/CE 

(0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) was not significantly different 

from that observed in the placebo group. These 

results suggested that treatment with proges-

tin-free therapy for menopausal symptoms in 

women with an intact uterus may be a new option. 

In the SMART-5 trial, subjects received daily oral 

BZA (20 ㎎)/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎), BZA 20 ㎎, CE 

0.45 ㎎/MPA 1.5 ㎎, or placebo. At 12 months, en-

dometrial hyperplasia incidence was less than 1% 

and this was similar among the groups with low 

rates of atypia. 31 In addition, the number of pro-

liferative endometrial cases at 12 months was low 

(< 1%), and also similar among the groups. Women 

treated with BZA/CE and CE/MPA showed sig-

nificantly greater increases in endometrial thick-

ness from baseline at 12 months compared to 

those of the placebo group. The adjusted mean 

changes in endometrial thickness from baseline 

were 0.17 ㎜ for BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.45 ㎎ (P < 0.05), 

0.51 ㎜ for BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.625 ㎎ (P < 0.001), and 

0.78 ㎜ for CE/MPA (P < 0.001), as opposed to 

0.09 ㎜ for placebo. Endometrial polyps were con-

firmed by endometrial biopsies. The number of 

women who developed polyps in the BZA 20 ㎎/CE 

0.45 ㎎ and CE/MPA groups was significantly high-

er than that in the placebo group. 31 

2. CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY 

From 12 to 24 months during follow-up, serious 

cardiovascular and treatment-emerent adverse 

events were observed in the women treated with 

BZA/CE, as compared with those who received 

the placebo. 21,29,31,33 CE and BZA increase the risk 

of venous thromboembolism (VTE); however, no 

added risk of VTE was observed when the two 

drugs were co-administered in the trials. 12 By the 

twelfth month during follow-up, there were no 

reports of VTE associated with BZA 20 ㎎/CE 0.45 

or 0.625 ㎎ treatments. There was however one 

report of superficial phlebitis in the CE 0.45 ㎎ 

/BZA 20 ㎎ group, and another report of cere-

brovascular accident (CVA) in the CE 0.625 ㎎/BZA 

20 ㎎ group. 34 

Actually, cardiovascular events such as VTE, 

CVA, or CHD were rare in this young population 

of postmenopausal women in the 2-year duration 

of the SMART studies. Accordingly, statistical 

power to evaluate VTE and cardiovascular risks 

was limited by the small number of such events 




Treatment with BZA 20 ㎎/CE (0.45 or 0.625 ㎎) also resulted in an increase in plasminogen activity at 12 months, higher than that observed with the placebo treatment. 34APPROPRIATE CANDIDATES FOR TSEC THERAPYBZA/CE is an effective and well-tolerated alternative to EPT for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS and for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus.2 However, choosing between the two treatments is a very difficult task, since there are few direct comparisons between the efficacies of EPT and TSEC. Palacios et al.12 have suggested that appropriate candidates for BZA/CE therapy instead of EPT in healthy postmenopausal women suffering from moderate to severe VMS with a intact uterus Women who experience other intolerable side effects of progestin-containing therapy including nausea, hirsutism, headache, dizziness, weight gain, and cyclical mild depression. Postmenopausal women with mood symptoms similar to those of premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder are also suitable candidates.include: 

(1) Women who experience bothersome vaginal 

bleeding or breast pain/tenderness. 

(2)
