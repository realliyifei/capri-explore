We reviewed the Chinese and English literature for the efficacy and safety data of valsartan monotherapy or combination therapy in Chinese hypertensive patients. According to the data of ten randomized controlled trials, valsartan monotherapy was as efficacious as another angiotensin receptor blocker or other classes of antihypertensive drugs, excepting the slightly inferior diastolic blood pressure-lowering effect in comparison with calcium channel blockers. According to the data of six randomized controlled trials, valsartan combination, with hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, or nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system, was more efficacious than monotherapy of valsartan, amlodipine, or nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system. According to these trials, valsartan had an acceptable tolerability, regardless of whether it was used as monotherapy or in combination therapy. Nonetheless, several rare side effects have been reported, indicating that it should still be used with caution. This is of particular importance given that there are millions of hypertensive patients, worldwide, currently exposed to the drug.

## Introduction

Since the first Chinese hypertension guidelines were published in 1999, 1 angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has been among the five classes of antihypertensive drugs recommended for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive therapy. Subsequent Chinese hypertensive guidelines, published in 2005 2 and 2011, 3 respectively, made similar recommendations for the choice of antihypertensive drugs. According to the 2012 Intercontinental Marketing Services report, valsartan, among several available agents in the class, is the most prescribed ARB for the management of hypertension in the People's Republic of China. 4 Valsartan is currently used as an agent of monotherapy or free-combination antihypertensive therapy and as a component of single-pill combination with hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine as well.

In spite of its wide use in the People's Republic of China, valsartan has never been studied in any hard-outcome study in this country, except for the 33 Chinese patients enrolled in the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial. 5 Nonetheless, several randomized controlled trials were conducted to study blood pressure-lowering efficacy and safety of valsartan monotherapy versus other antihypertensive drugs [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] or combination therapy versus the component drugs. [17][18][19][20][21] In addition, several case reports on rare side effects have been published in the Chinese literature. [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] In the present review, we first summarized the results of the comparative therapeutic studies that investigated efficacy and safety of valsartan monotherapy or combination 


## Selection of studies

We searched randomized controlled trials and side effect case reports involving valsartan via PubMed (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and VIP (http://www.cqvip.com/) for the English-and Chinese-language literature, respectively. For inclusion, a randomized controlled trial had to have been conducted in Chinese hypertensive patients and published in a peer-reviewed journal in the period from January 1, 1999 (from which time valsartan entered the Chinese market) to May 31, 2013; had a randomized parallel-group or cross-over design; compared valsartan monotherapy or combination therapy with placebo or other antihypertensive drugs; and assessed blood pressure at baseline and during follow-up. A case report must have been on a side effect attributable to the use of valsartan in the People's Republic of China and published in a peer-reviewed journal before May 31, 2013. We excluded trials in Chinese patients with a disease other than hypertension, such as heart failure or albuminuria.


## Efficacy of valsartan monotherapy in Chinese hypertensive patients

We identified eleven trials that compared valsartan monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (benazepril 6 and enalapril 7,8 ); another ARB (olmesartan 9,10 ); calcium channel blockers ([CCBs] amlodipine, [11][12][13] benidipine, 14 and lacidipine 15 ); or a diuretic (indapamide). 16 Table 1 shows the characteristics of these trials and the randomized patients. These trials had a sample size of 42 subjects 7 to 260 subjects, 11 and follow-up time of 1 week 15 to 48 weeks. 14 All these trials individually had insufficient power to show superiority, equivalence, or noninferiority at a difference of 2-3 mmHg systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Nonetheless, the pooled analyses were able to provide sufficient power for all trials (n=1,232) 6-16 as well as for the subgroup of trials that compared valsartan with CCBs (n=760), [11][12][13][14][15] but not for the subgroups of trials that compared valsartan with ACE inhibitors (n=201) [6][7][8] or another ARB (n=151). 9,10 Overall, valsartan had similar blood pressure-lowering efficacy as the other classes of antihypertensive drugs or olmesartan, for systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure (P$0.18) (Figure 1). There was significant heterogeneity across trials for diastolic blood pressure (P#0.001) but not for systolic blood pressure (P=0.99). In drug-class-specific subgroup analyses, valsartan tended to be less efficacious than CCBs in reducing diastolic blood pressure (mean difference −2.41 mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −4.88 to 0.06 mmHg; P=0.056), with no significant heterogeneity across trials (P=0.13). [11][12][13][14][15] Since the follow-up times of these trials varied substantially, and valsartan may require a few weeks or even months to exert its full antihypertensive effect, we performed subgroup analysis in the three trials that had a follow-up time of at least 24 weeks. 7,13,14 The results of this subgroup analysis were confirmatory: indeed, valsartan was similarly efficacious as enalapril in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P$0.73), but tended to be less efficacious than CCBs in reducing diastolic (mean difference −3.52 mmHg; 95% CI: −7.01 to 0.01 mmHg; P=0.051) but not systolic blood pressure (P=0.32).

In addition, blood pressure-lowering efficacy of various classes of antihypertensive drugs, including valsartan, may be dependent on dietary sodium intake, which is known to be higher in northern than in southern People's Republic of China. We therefore performed subgroup analysis in trials conducted in northern 6,8,9,11,14 versus southern People's Republic of China. 7,10,12,13,15,16 The number of trials allowed comparison between northern and southern People's Republic of China for the treatment effects of all trials [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] and the trials of CCBs. [11][12][13][14][15] Valsartan was similarly efficacious as CCBs or all the other antihypertensive drugs in northern and southern People's Republic of China (P$0.19), except that valsartan was significantly less efficacious in reducing diastolic blood pressure than CCBs (mean difference −4.86 mmHg; 95% CI: −7.53 to −2.19 mmHg; P,0.001) and all the other antihypertensive drugs (mean difference −2.50 mmHg; 95% CI: −4.59 to −0.40 mmHg; P=0.02) in southern People's Republic of China. However, the treatment effects between northern and southern People's Republic of China in reducing diastolic blood pressure differed significantly only in the trials of CCBs (P=0.02) but not all trials (P=0.60).


## Efficacy of valsartan combination therapy in Chinese hypertensive patients

We identified six trials ( Table 1) that compared valsartan single-pill (with hydrochlorothiazide 17,18 or amlodipine 19,20 ) or free (with nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system [GITS] 21 ) combination therapy with valsartan, [17][18][19]21 amlodipine, 19 or nifedipine GITS monotherapy. 20 All trials had a two-group parallel comparison, except one that compared the single-pill combination of valsartan and amlodipine with two different dosage groups of valsartan (80 and 160 mg/ day). 19 These trials had a sample size of 123 subjects 18  (12)/73 (8) 140 (11) (10) 152 (8)/94 (7) 152 (8) Overall, valsartan combination, on average, showed reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures 2-6 mmHg more than monotherapy (Figure 2). If the superiority in blood

These interesting observations warrant further investigation.


## Side effects profile in randomized controlled clinical trials

In some, [6][7][8][9][10][11][17][18][19][20][21] though not all, 12-16 of the aforementioned randomized controlled trials, information on adverse events and serious adverse events was systematically collected and reported (Table 2). In the monotherapy trials, 6-11 the incidence rate of adverse events with valsartan was lower than with ACE inhibitors (pooled odds ratio associated with ACE inhibition 3.51; 95% CI: 1.45-9.25; P=0.0035) [6][7][8] and similar to the rate with another ARB (P=0.80) 9,10 and amlodipine (P=0.99). 11 There was no adverse event that was typically overrepresented in the valsartan group, regardless of the follow-up time.

In the combination therapy trials, 17-21 the incidence rate of drug-related adverse events was higher with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination than with valsartan monotherapy (pooled odds ratio associated with the combination 1.71; 95% CI: 1.05-2.82; P=0.029) 17,18 and lower with valsartan/ amlodipine combination (5.7%) than with nifedipine GITS (15.6%; odds ratio associated with nifedipine GITS 3.07; 95% CI: 1.65-5.99; P,0.001). 20 However, the incidence rate of the drug-related adverse events was similar between valsartan/amlodipine combination and valsartan or amlodipine monotherapy (P$0.59) 19 and between valsartan/nifedipine GITS combination and valsartan monotherapy (P=0.99). 21 The adverse events reported in the combination groups to a large extent reflected a component of the combination other than valsartan, such as hyperuricemia and hypokalemia associated with hydrochlorothiazide, 17 palpitations and flushing associated with nifedipine GITS, 21 and peripheral edema associated with amlodipine 19,20 and nifedipine GITS. 21 In addition, one randomized study specifically investigated the hematologic effect of valsartan (n=30) versus benazepril (n=30). 22 In this study, valsartan significantly (P,0.001) decreased serum concentrations of erythropoietin (mean ± standard deviation from 14.2±3.2 to 12.1±2.9 U/L) and hemoglobin from baseline (from 144.3±13.8 to 135.2±14.8 g/L), whereas these hematologic measurements did not change with benazepril (P.0.05). This observation also warrants further investigation.  


## Side effects profile in clinical practice

Because of the limited number of patients in a randomized controlled trial, rare side effects are usually difficult to detect; however, in clinical practice, with millions of users of a drug, rare side effects can be discovered. We reviewed case reports that described side effects probably or possibly related to the use of valsartan, and identified eight publications (Table 3). [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30] There was one case in each of these eight reports. Of these eight cases, seven had a single clinical manifestation (angioedema, cough, drug eruption, hematuria, hypotension, muscle pain, or urticaria), and one had multiple clinical manifestations (urticaria, vertigo, muscle pain, and upper respiratory tract infection). Angioedema, drug eruption, and urticaria can be similarly attributable to hypersensitivity to valsartan.

## Conclusion

Valsartan monotherapy was as efficacious as any another ARB or other classes of antihypertensive drugs, except in the case of the slightly inferior diastolic blood pressurelowering effect in comparison with CCBs. However, valsartan combination therapy, either with amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, or nifedipine GITS was more efficacious than monotherapy of amlodipine or valsartan. Valsartan had acceptable tolerability, regardless of whether it was used as monotherapy or in combination therapy. Nonetheless, several rare side effects have been reported, indicating that valsartan should still be used with caution. This point is of particular importance given the millions of hypertensive patients currently exposed to the drug. In addition, all trials included in the present review were conducted exclusively or predominantly in ethnic Han Chinese. More research is required in ethnic minority Chinese populations, especially those with different lifestyle.
