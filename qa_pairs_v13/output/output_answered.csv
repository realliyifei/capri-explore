How do BERT's embeddings differ from conventional static embeddings?","BERT's embeddings are contextualized, meaning that the representation of each input token varies depending on its specific context of occurrence, unlike conventional static embeddings which assign a fixed vector to each word regardless of context (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Pennington et al., 2014). BERT's contextualized embeddings are the output vectors from a given Transformer layer, often the final one. These embeddings form distinct clusters that correspond to different word senses, supporting the distributional hypothesis. However, the representation of the same word can change based on its position within a sentence, influenced by BERT's Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objective. Studies have shown that as one moves to higher layers in BERT, the embeddings become more context-specific. Additionally, BERT embeddings tend to occupy a narrow cone in vector space, meaning that random words are more likely to have a higher cosine similarity than if the embeddings were uniformly distributed across all directions, an effect that becomes more pronounced in higher layers of the model (Wiedemann et al., 2019; Mickus et al., 2019; Ethayarajh, 2019).","Questions:

The corresponding labels are obtained through a (semi-)automatic process from an external source of information. For named entity recognition (NER), a list of location names might be obtained from a dictionary and matches of tokens in the text with entities in the list are automatically labeled as locations. Distant supervision was introduced by Mintz et al. (2009) for relation extraction (RE) with extensions on multi-instance (Riedel et al., 2010) and multi-label learning (Surdeanu et al., 2012). It is still a popular approach for information extraction tasks like NER and RE where the external information can be obtained from knowledge bases, gazetteers, dictionaries and other forms of structured knowledge sources (Luo et al., 2017;Hedderich and Klakow, 2018;Deng and Sun, 2019;Alt et al., 2019;Ye et al., 2019;Lange et al., 2019a;Nooralahzadeh et al., 2019;Le and Titov, 2019;Cao et al., 2019;Lison et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2021a). The automatic annotation ranges from simple string matching  to complex pipelines including classifiers and manual steps (Norman et al., 2019). This distant supervision using information from external knowledge sources can be seen as a subset of the more general approach of labeling rules. These encompass also other ideas like reg-ex rules or simple programming functions (Ratner et al., 2017;Zheng et al., 2019;Adelani et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2020;Lison et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020;Karamanolakis et al., 2021).

For topic classification, heuristics can be used in combination with inputs from other classifiers like NER (Bach et al., 2019) or from entity lists (Hedderich et al., 2020). For some classification tasks, the labels can be rephrased with simple rules into sentences. A pretrained language model then judges the label sentence that most likely follows the unlabeled input (Opitz, 2019;). An unlabeled review, for instance, might be continued with ""It was great/bad"" for obtaining binary sentiment labels.

(p7.2) Open Issues: The popularity of distant supervision for NER and RE might be due to these tasks being particularly suited. There, auxiliary data like entity lists is readily available and distant supervision often achieves reasonable results with simple surface form rules. It is an open question whether a task needs to have specific properties to be suitable for this approach. The existing work on other tasks and the popularity in other fields like image classification (Xiao et al., 2015;Li et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2018;Mahajan et al., 2018; suggests, however, that distant supervision could be leveraged for more NLP tasks in the future.

(p7.3) Distant supervision methods heavily rely on auxiliary data. In a low-resource setting, it might be difficult to obtain not only labeled data but also such auxiliary data. Kann et al. (2020) find a large gap between the performance on high-resource and low-resource languages for POS tagging pointing to the lack of high-coverage and error-free dictionaries for the weak supervision in low-resource languages. This emphasizes the need for evaluating such methods in a realistic setting and avoiding to just simulate restricted access to labeled data in a high-resource language.

(p7.0) In contrast to data augmentation, distant or weak supervision uses unlabeled text and keeps it unmodified. The corresponding labels are obtained through a (semi-)automatic process from an external source of information. For named entity recognition (NER), a list of location names might be obtained from a dictionary and matches of tokens in the text with entities in the list are automatically labeled as locations. Distant supervision was introduced by Mintz et al. (2009) for relation extraction (RE) with extensions on multi-instance (Riedel et al., 2010) and multi-label learning (Surdeanu et al., 2012). It is still a popular approach for information extraction tasks like NER and RE where the external information can be obtained from knowledge bases, gazetteers, dictionaries and other forms of structured knowledge sources (Luo et al., 2017;Hedderich and Klakow, 2018;Deng and Sun, 2019;Alt et al., 2019;Ye et al., 2019;Lange et al., 2019a;Nooralahzadeh et al., 2019;Le and Titov, 2019;Cao et al., 2019;Lison et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2021a). The automatic annotation ranges from simple string matching  to complex pipelines including classifiers and manual steps (Norman et al., 2019). This distant supervision using information from external knowledge sources can be seen as a subset of the more general approach of labeling rules. These encompass also other ideas like reg-ex rules or simple programming functions (Ratner et al., 2017;Zheng et al., 2019;Adelani et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2020;Lison et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020;Karamanolakis et al., 2021).

(p7.1) While distant supervision is popular for information extraction tasks like NER and RE, it is less prevalent in other areas of NLP. Nevertheless, distant supervision has also been successfully em-  (2020) build a discourse-structure dataset using guidance from sentiment annotations. For topic classification, heuristics can be used in combination with inputs from other classifiers like NER (Bach et al., 2019) or from entity lists (Hedderich et al., 2020). For some classification tasks, the labels can be rephrased with simple rules into sentences. A pretrained language model then judges the label sentence that most likely follows the unlabeled input (Opitz, 2019;). An unlabeled review, for instance, might be continued with ""It was great/bad"" for obtaining binary sentiment labels.

(p7.2) Open Issues: The popularity of distant supervision for NER and RE might be due to these tasks being particularly suited. There, auxiliary data like entity lists is readily available and distant supervision often achieves reasonable results with simple surface form rules. It is an open question whether a task needs to have specific properties to be suitable for this approach. The existing work on other tasks and the popularity in other fields like image classification (Xiao et al., 2015;Li et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2018;Mahajan et al., 2018; suggests, however, that distant supervision could be leveraged for more NLP tasks in the future.

(p7.3) Distant supervision methods heavily rely on auxiliary data. In a low-resource setting, it might be difficult to obtain not only labeled data but also such auxiliary data. Kann et al. (2020) find a large gap between the performance on high-resource and low-resource languages for POS tagging pointing to the lack of high-coverage and error-free dictionaries for the weak supervision in low-resource languages. This emphasizes the need for evaluating such methods in a realistic setting and avoiding to just simulate restricted access to labeled data in a high-resource language.

(p7.4) While distant supervision allows obtaining labeled data more quickly than manually annotating every instance of a dataset, it still requires human interaction to create automatic annotation techniques or to provide labeling rules. This time and effort could also be spent on annotating more gold label data, either naively or through an active learning scheme. Unfortunately, distant supervision papers rarely provide information on how long the creation took, making it difficult to compare these approaches. Taking the human expert into the focus connects this research direction with humancomputer-interaction and human-in-the-loop setups (Klie et al., 2018;Qian et al., 2020).","A Survey on Recent Approaches for Natural Language Processing in Low-Resource Scenarios

In order to understand the task of stance detection, we first provide definitions of stance and the stance-taking process. Biber and Finegan (1988) define stance as the expression of a speaker's standpoint and judgement towards a given proposition. Further, Du Bois (2007)) define stance as ""a public act by a social actor, achieved dialogically through overt communicative means, of simultaneously evaluating objects, positioning subjects (self and others), and aligning with other subjects, with respect to any salient dimension of the sociocultural field"", showing that the stance-taking process is affected not only by personal opinions, but also by other external factors such as cultural norms, roles in the institution of the family, etc. Here, we adopt the general definition of stance detection by Küçük and Can (2020): ""for an input in the form of a piece of text and a target pair, stance detection is a classification problem where the stance of the author of the text is sought in the form of a category label from this set: Favor, Against, Neither. Occasionally, the category label of Neutral is also added to the set of stance categories (Mohammad et al., 2016), and the target may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the text"" (Augenstein et al., 2016;Mohammad et al., 2016). Note that the stance detection definitions and the label inventories vary somewhat, depending on the target application (see Section 3).

Finally, stance detection can be distinguished from several other closely related NLP tasks: (i) biased language detection, where the existence of an inclination or tendency towards a particular perspective within a text is explored, (ii) emotion recognition, where the goal is to recognise emotions such as love, anger, etc. in the text, (iii) perspective identification, which aims to find the pointof-view of the author (e.g., Democrat vs. Republican) and the target is always explicit, (iv) sarcasm detection, where the interest is in satirical or ironic pieces of text, often written with the intent of ridicule or mockery, and (v) sentiment analysis, which checks the polarity of a piece of text.",What distinguishes stance detection from related NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or sarcasm detection?,1.

(2019) note that ""data augmentation is typically performed in an adhoc manner with little understanding of the underlying theoretical principles"", and claim the typical explanation of DA as regularization to be insufficient. Overall, there indeed appears to be a lack of research on why exactly DA works. Existing work on this topic is mainly surface-level, and rarely investigates the theoretical underpinnings and principles. We discuss this challenge more in §6, and highlight some of the existing work below. Bishop (1995) show training with noised examples is reducible to Tikhonov regularization (subsumes L2). Rajput et al. (2019) show that DA can increase the positive margin for classifiers, but only when augmenting exponentially many examples for common DA methods. Dao et al. (2019) think of DA transformations as kernels, and find two ways DA helps: averaging of features and variance regularization. Chen et al. (2020d) show that DA leads to variance reduction by averaging over orbits of the group that keep the data distribution approximately invariant.']","What is data augmentation?

What are the primary challenges and considerations in applying data augmentation techniques in NLP?","Data augmentation (DA) in natural language processing (NLP) involves methods to increase the diversity of training data without the need for additional data collection. This is achieved through modifications of existing data or the creation of synthetic data, with the goal of acting as a regularizer to mitigate overfitting in machine learning model training. While DA is more straightforward in computer vision (CV) with techniques like cropping and flipping, NLP presents unique challenges due to its discrete input space, making it less clear how to generate effective augmented examples that maintain desired invariances.

The primary challenges in applying DA techniques in NLP include the difficulty of generating text that captures the necessary invariances and the balance between making augmented data neither too similar nor too divergent from the original data to avoid overfitting or underperformance. Effective DA in NLP must navigate trade-offs between ease of implementation and the potential for performance improvement. Rule-based techniques, while simpler to implement, often yield only incremental improvements. In contrast, model-based approaches can introduce greater data variation and potentially offer significant performance boosts but may be more complex and costly to develop.

Moreover, the distribution of augmented data is crucial; it should be balanced to ensure it is representative of the domain without leading to overfitting or poor generalization. Some researchers have proposed methods like a KL-Divergence-based unsupervised procedure to select among DA heuristics efficiently, addressing the cost and time-intensive nature of comparing multiple heuristics.

Despite its widespread use, there is a noted lack of deep understanding of the theoretical principles underpinning DA's effectiveness. Some studies suggest that training with noised examples can be akin to Tikhonov regularization, and DA can improve classifier margins or reduce variance through specific transformations, indicating that DA's benefits might stem from averaging features and variance regularization. However, the theoretical foundations and principles of DA in NLP remain an area requiring further exploration.","Questions:

Despite its widespread use, there is a noted lack of deep understanding of the theoretical principles underpinning DA's effectiveness. Some studies suggest that training with noised examples can be akin to Tikhonov regularization, and DA can improve classifier margins or reduce variance through specific transformations, indicating that DA's benefits might stem from averaging features and variance regularization. However, the theoretical foundations and principles of DA in NLP remain an area requiring further exploration.","Data augmentation (DA) in natural language processing (NLP) involves increasing the diversity of training data without the need for additional data collection. This is achieved through methods that either modify existing data slightly or generate new, synthetic data. The primary goal is to use augmented data as a regularizer to help reduce overfitting in machine learning models. While DA is well-established in computer vision (CV) with techniques like cropping and flipping, applying DA in NLP presents unique challenges due to the discrete nature of text. This requires generating effective augmented examples that maintain the desired invariances.

Several DA techniques for NLP have been proposed, ranging from simple rule-based manipulations to more complex generative approaches. These techniques aim to balance ease of implementation with the potential to improve model performance. Rule-based methods are straightforward but tend to offer only incremental improvements, whereas model-based techniques, though potentially more costly to implement, can introduce a greater variety of data and achieve significant performance enhancements. However, developing and utilizing model-based techniques tailored for specific downstream tasks can be challenging.

An ideal DA approach should ensure that the distribution of augmented data is neither too similar nor too divergent from the original data to avoid increased overfitting or poor performance due to non-representative training examples. Achieving this balance is crucial for effective DA. Additionally, there is a need for a better understanding of DA's theoretical foundations, as current interpretations, such as viewing DA as a form of regularization, may be insufficient. Research into the theoretical aspects of DA, including its role in variance reduction and feature averaging, is ongoing but still at a relatively early stage.","Questions:

Cabrio and Villata (2018) provide an elaborate overview of the AM framework in their data-driven analysis of the state of the art after five years of significant developments in the field of AM. Generally speaking, given a collection of natural language texts, the task at hand is implemented in two stages: Argument extraction The system first identifies the documents which contain the argumentative structure and the specific textual spans in which argumentation is encoded. Once the textual boundaries are defined, subportions of the argumentative spans are assigned to a set of pre-established argument components (e.g. claims, premises, rebuttal, etc.). A variety of models were used for this including Näive Bayes (Moens et al., 2007), SVMs (Mochales andMoens, 2011), RNNs (Niculae et al., 2017;Eger et al., 2017), Pre-trained Language Models (Chakrabarty et al., 2019;Lugini and Litman, 2020), and other supervised-learning techniques (Ein-Dor et al., 2020).

Relation assignment The goal of the second stage is to model the relations between the argumentative spans identified in the first stage. These relations can exist between different arguments (support, attack) as well as within an argument (connecting the premises with the claim). Recent approaches to argumentative relation classification investigate for example relational models (Trautmann et al., 2020) or inject background knowledge by leveraging features from different knowledge bases (Kobbe et al., 2019). Detecting these relations is necessary to model the overall structure of the argumentation (discourse/debate). As this structure can be complex, the task is difficult, involving high-level knowledge representation and reasoning issues. After the relations are detected, the discourse structure can then be mapped to a graph representation, called argumentation graph, with the arguments as nodes and relations as edges.

To simplify the problem, some approaches reduce the graph to a tree-structure representation (Peldszus and Stede, 2015;Stab and Gurevych, 2017). Different methods to generate the structure have been investigated, e.g. SVMs (Habernal and Gurevych, 2017;Niculae et al., 2017) or textual entailment (Cabrio and Villata, 2013;Cocarascu et al., 2020). Modeling the relations and argumentation flow within a debate is an important factor when defining the notion of argument quality, which will be presented in Section 3.

Consider the following example taken from an online debate about compulsory vaccinations 3 which demonstrates the framework quite clearly. Given a statement presenting background and context, participants are asked to discuss the question ""Does public health demand vaccinations?"" (Claims are in bold, and premises are underlined.) A1: A vaccine is the best way to prevent an outbreak of a disease or to reduce its negative effects. Vaccinated people become immune to a certain pathogen and do not develop a disease. Although there are occasionally side effects, these affect only a tiny number of people compared to the protection offered to the vast majority.

A2: Many vaccines have serious and sometimes deadly side effects. With many vaccines the immunity is not lifelong. Sometimes the vaccines itself can cause a serious disease to develop as a side effect. If governments know that compulsory mass vaccination is likely to cause death or permanent disability in even a few cases, it is immoral for them to make it compulsory.

Here, the argumentative text boundaries are first determined from the natural language discussion and the argument components (claims and premises) are extracted. Then, the relations between the two arguments are as follows: A 1 supports the argument while A 2 attacks it. However, consider another example, extracted from an online debate platform Kialo 4 . Here, the participants' contribution and the structure mirror a more direct and conversational dynamic to argumentation.

A1: Marvel Universe is better than DC Universe.

A2: Stan Lee's vision contains clarity and purpose, while DC is simply interested in churning entertainment to the masses.

A3: Stan Lee no-longer has control over any of marvel, which can cloud the purpose of Marvel due to it being owned by Disney.

A4: This is especially true due to his unfortunate passing.

A5: DC has been more apt to recycle parts of Intellectual Property, they even made an entire movie using the ideas of the 1960's characters and comics.

The seemingly simple example of an online exchange shows how a more conversational environment provides vaguer boundaries of argumentation structure and components. Each argument is more direct, not necessarily consisting of a claimpremise configuration, and the strength and productive quality of each argument is particularly relative to the context, each contribution affecting the argument differently either at a local or global level. Note, however, that the relations between arguments and claim are still relatively clear (e.g. A 2 supports while A 5 attacks the main claim in A 1 ; A 3 attacks A 2 directly; and A 4 closes any further 4 https://www.kialo.com/explore/ featured discussion on A 3 's premise).

Clearly, the environment and type of platform under consideration have a significant impact on a system's capacity to implement such a framework and on the degree of complexity found in the components and relations to extract, assign, and predict. Working in the realm of overtly argumentative text (such as persuasive essays (Stab and Gurevych, 2017)), while challenging of course, can be quite standardized.

Framework
##
Cabrio and Villata (2018) provide an elaborate overview of the AM framework in their data-driven analysis of the state of the art after five years of significant developments in the field of AM. Generally speaking, given a collection of natural language texts, the task at hand is implemented in two stages: Argument extraction The system first identifies the documents which contain the argumentative structure and the specific textual spans in which argumentation is encoded. Once the textual boundaries are defined, subportions of the argumentative spans are assigned to a set of pre-established argument components (e.g. claims, premises, rebuttal, etc.). A variety of models were used for this including Näive Bayes (Moens et al., 2007), SVMs (Mochales andMoens, 2011), RNNs (Niculae et al., 2017;Eger et al., 2017), Pre-trained Language Models (Chakrabarty et al., 2019;Lugini and Litman, 2020), and other supervised-learning techniques (Ein-Dor et al., 2020).
Relation assignment The goal of the second stage is to model the relations between the argumentative spans identified in the first stage. These relations can exist between different arguments (support, attack) as well as within an argument (connecting the premises with the claim). Recent approaches to argumentative relation classification investigate for example relational models (Trautmann et al., 2020) or inject background knowledge by leveraging features from different knowledge bases (Kobbe et al., 2019). Detecting these relations is necessary to model the overall structure of the argumentation (discourse/debate). As this structure can be complex, the task is difficult, involving high-level knowledge representation and reasoning issues. After the relations are detected, the discourse structure can then be mapped to a graph representation, called argumentation graph, with the arguments as nodes and relations as edges.
To simplify the problem, some approaches reduce the graph to a tree-structure representation (Peldszus and Stede, 2015;Stab and Gurevych, 2017). Different methods to generate the structure have been investigated, e.g. SVMs (Habernal and Gurevych, 2017;Niculae et al., 2017) or textual entailment (Cabrio and Villata, 2013;Cocarascu et al., 2020). Modeling the relations and argumentation flow within a debate is an important factor when defining the notion of argument quality, which will be presented in Section 3.
Consider the following example taken from an online debate about compulsory vaccinations 3 which demonstrates the framework quite clearly. Given a statement presenting background and context, participants are asked to discuss the question ""Does public health demand vaccinations?"" (Claims are in bold, and premises are underlined.) A1: A vaccine is the best way to prevent an outbreak of a disease or to reduce its negative effects. Vaccinated people become immune to a certain pathogen and do not develop a disease. Although there are occasionally side effects, these affect only a tiny number of people compared to the protection offered to the vast majority.
A2: Many vaccines have serious and sometimes deadly side effects. With many vaccines the immunity is not lifelong. Sometimes the vaccines itself can cause a serious disease to develop as a side effect. If governments know that compulsory mass vaccination is likely to cause death or permanent disability in even a few cases, it is immoral for them to make it compulsory.

What are the stages involved in the argument mining framework and how are they implemented?","Cabrio and Villata (2018) provide a detailed overview of the argument mining (AM) framework, highlighting its implementation in two main stages. The first stage, argument extraction, involves identifying documents with argumentative structures and pinpointing the specific textual spans where argumentation occurs. This includes defining the textual boundaries and assigning subportions of these spans to predefined argument components such as claims, premises, and rebuttals. Various models, including Näive Bayes (Moens et al., 2007), SVMs (Mochales and Moens, 2011), RNNs (Niculae et al., 2017; Eger et al., 2017), Pre-trained Language Models (Chakrabarty et al., 2019; Lugini and Litman, 2020), and other supervised learning techniques (Ein-Dor et al., 2020), have been employed for this purpose.

The second stage, relation assignment, aims to model the relations between the argumentative spans identified in the first stage. This involves classifying relations that can either support or attack between different arguments, or connect premises with the claim within an argument. Recent methods for classifying these argumentative relations include relational models (Trautmann et al., 2020) and leveraging features from various knowledge bases (Kobbe et al., 2019) to inject background knowledge.

Modeling these relations and the flow of argumentation is crucial for defining argument quality.

Examples from online debates illustrate how the framework operates in practice, showing the process of determining argumentative text boundaries, extracting argument components, and assigning relations between arguments.

How do code-switching and borrowing differ in linguistic integration?","Code-switching involves an active alternation between different grammatical systems, whereas borrowing typically does not entail such alternation. It is challenging to distinguish between a single word insertion being a case of borrowing or code-switching without analyzing how these elements integrate into the grammar of the recipient language. Most instances of lone-item insertions are classified as nonce borrowings, which are one-time borrowings. Complex code-switching might not always be recognized as switching; it can range from being pragmatic and intentional to serving no specific pragmatic purpose, or even forming the single linguistic code of a community, such as in the cases of Michif Cree or Gurinji Kriol, which may appear structurally similar to code-switching but are considered a single language. Surzhyk, spoken by Russian-Ukrainian bilinguals, exemplifies a linguistic phenomenon that blurs the lines between code-switching and mixed languages due to the high bilingual proficiency of its speakers and the indeterminate direction of switching. Loan translation and transfer involve adopting the semantics and grammatical structures of one language while using the lexicon of another. For instance, in Turkish spoken in the Netherlands, the verb ""yapmak"" adopts the Dutch meaning similar to ""doen,"" indicating the completion of primary school in Istanbul. Similarly, grammatical constructions, such as verb particles, can be transferred from one language to another without borrowing the actual words, as seen in the adoption of Germanic verb particles into French spoken in Brussels and Ontario, where phrases translate directly from Dutch and English equivalents, respectively, diverging from standard French usage in France.","Questions:

Loan translation and transfer involve adopting semantics and grammatical constructions from one language while using words from another, as seen in the Turkish spoken in the Netherlands where the verb ""yapmak"" adopts the Dutch meaning of ""doen"" (Dogruöz and Backus, 2009). Similarly, grammatical constructions can be transferred from one language to another without borrowing the words, exemplified by the transfer of verb particles from Germanic languages into French, affecting variations of French spoken in Brussels and Ontario, which incorporate particles not found in standard French (Treffers-Daller, 2012).","Questions:

How do code-switching and borrowing differ in linguistic integration?

Answer:

Code-switching involves an active alternation between grammatical systems, whereas borrowing does not necessarily integrate into the grammar of the receiving language in the same way. Most lone-item insertions, upon analysis, are identified as nonce borrowings rather than code-switching, indicating a one-time borrowing event (Sankoff et al., 1990). Complex code-switching may not always be recognized as switching; for instance, Auer (1999) outlines a continuum from prototypical code-switching, which is pragmatic and intentional, to language mixing, which serves no pragmatic purpose, and mixed languages, which are considered the single code of a community and can be modeled as a single language, such as Michif Cree or Gurinji Kriol.

How do NLP models maintain robustness under natural distribution shifts?

Answer:

Research on NLP model robustness under natural distribution shifts focuses on performance when data comes from a different, naturally occurring distribution (Hendrycks et al., 2021). This concept is distinct from domain adaptation (Patel et al., 2015; Wilson and Cook, 2020) and transfer learning (Pan and Yang, 2010), aligning more closely with domain generalization (Muandet et al., 2013; Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz, 2021) or out-of-distribution generalization (Hendrycks et al., 2020a), where models are expected to generalize to unforeseen distribution shifts without adaptation.

Starting from the raw text, the first step consists in identifying the entities and eventually assigning them a type. Entities involve either nominals or named entities, and hence it is either Named Entity Recognition (NER) or, more broadly, Mention Detection (MD). 5 After entities are identified, approaches start to be more blurry as studies have approached RE via different angles.', 'One way is to take two steps, Relation Identification (RI) and subsequent Relation Classification (RC) , as illustrated in Figure 2. This means to first identify from all the possible entity pairs the ones which are in some kind of relation via a binary classification task (RI). As the proportion of positive samples over the negative is usually extremely unbalanced towards the latter (Gormley et al., 2015), a priori heuristics are generally applied to reduce the possible combinations (e.g., entity pairs involving distant entities, or entity type pairs not licensed by the relations are not even considered). The last step (RC) is usually a multi-class classification to assign a relation type r to the positive samples from the previous step. Some studies merge RI and RC (Seganti et al., 2021) into one step, by adding a no-relation (no-rel) label. Other studies instead reduce the task to RC, and assume there exists a relation between two entities and the task is to determine the type (without a no-rel label). Regardless, RI is influenced by the RC setup: Relations which are not in the RC label set are considered as negative samples in the RI phase. Some studies address this approximation by distinguishing between the no-rel and the None-Of-The-Above (NOTA) relation (Gao et al., 2019). Note that, in our definition, the NOTA label differs from no-rel in the sense that a relation holds between the two entities, but its type is not in the considered RC label set. 6 What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction? RE studies rarely address the whole pipeline. We 5 Some studies divide the entity extraction into two substeps: identification (often called MD), and subsequent classification into entity types. 6 Some studies name such relation Other (Hendrickx et al., 2010). analyze all the ACL papers published in the last five years which contain the Relation Extraction keyword in the title and determine which sub-task is performed (NER/MD, RI, RC). Table 2 shows such investigation. We leave out from this analysis (a) papers which make use of distant supervision or which somehow involve knowledge bases, (b) shared task papers, (c) the bioNLP field, (d) temporal RE, and (e) Open RE. The result shows that gold entities are usually assumed for RE, presumably given the complexity of the NER/MD task on its own. Most importantly, for end-to-end models, recent work has shown that ablations for steps like NER are lacking (Taillé et al., 2020).

Entities involve either nominals or named entities, and hence it is either Named Entity Recognition (NER) or, more broadly, Mention Detection (MD). 5 After entities are identified, approaches start to be more blurry as studies have approached RE via different angles.

One way is to take two steps, Relation Identification (RI) and subsequent Relation Classification (RC) , as illustrated in Figure 2. This means to first identify from all the possible entity pairs the ones which are in some kind of relation via a binary classification task (RI). As the proportion of positive samples over the negative is usually extremely unbalanced towards the latter (Gormley et al., 2015), a priori heuristics are generally applied to reduce the possible combinations (e.g., entity pairs involving distant entities, or entity type pairs not licensed by the relations are not even considered). The last step (RC) is usually a multi-class classification to assign a relation type r to the positive samples from the previous step. Some studies merge RI and RC (Seganti et al., 2021) into one step, by adding a no-relation (no-rel) label. Other studies instead reduce the task to RC, and assume there exists a relation between two entities and the task is to determine the type (without a no-rel label). Regardless, RI is influenced by the RC setup: Relations which are not in the RC label set are considered as negative samples in the RI phase. Some studies address this approximation by distinguishing between the no-rel and the None-Of-The-Above (NOTA) relation (Gao et al., 2019). Note that, in our definition, the NOTA label differs from no-rel in the sense that a relation holds between the two entities, but its type is not in the considered RC label set. 6 What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction?

1. What are the main components of the relation extraction process in NLP?

Answer:

(p2.0) Conceptually, RE involves a pipeline of steps (see Figure 2). Starting from the raw text, the first step consists in identifying the entities and eventually assigning them a type. Entities involve either nominals or named entities, and hence it is either Named Entity Recognition (NER) or, more broadly, Mention Detection (MD). 5 After entities are identified, approaches start to be more blurry as studies have approached RE via different angles.

(p2.1) One way is to take two steps, Relation Identification (RI) and subsequent Relation Classification (RC) , as illustrated in Figure 2. This means to first identify from all the possible entity pairs the ones which are in some kind of relation via a binary classification task (RI). As the proportion of positive samples over the negative is usually extremely unbalanced towards the latter (Gormley et al., 2015), a priori heuristics are generally applied to reduce the possible combinations (e.g., entity pairs involving distant entities, or entity type pairs not licensed by the relations are not even considered). The last step (RC) is usually a multi-class classification to assign a relation type r to the positive samples from the previous step. Some studies merge RI and RC (Seganti et al., 2021) into one step, by adding a no-relation (no-rel) label. Other studies instead reduce the task to RC, and assume there exists a relation between two entities and the task is to determine the type (without a no-rel label). Regardless, RI is influenced by the RC setup: Relations which are not in the RC label set are considered as negative samples in the RI phase. Some studies address this approximation by distinguishing between the no-rel and the None-Of-The-Above (NOTA) relation (Gao et al., 2019). Note that, in our definition, the NOTA label differs from no-rel in the sense that a relation holds between the two entities, but its type is not in the considered RC label set. 6 What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction? RE studies rarely address the whole pipeline. We 5 Some studies divide the entity extraction into two substeps: identification (often called MD), and subsequent classification into entity types. 6 Some studies name such relation Other (Hendrickx et al., 2010). analyze all the ACL papers published in the last five years which contain the Relation Extraction keyword in the title and determine which sub-task is performed (NER/MD, RI, RC). Table 2 shows such investigation. We leave out from this analysis (a) papers which make use of distant supervision or which somehow involve knowledge bases, (b) shared task papers, (c) the bioNLP field, (d) temporal RE, and (e) Open RE. The result shows that gold entities are usually assumed for RE, presumably given the complexity of the NER/MD task on its own. Most importantly, for end-to-end models, recent work has shown that ablations for steps like NER are lacking (Taillé et al., 2020). Our analysis further shows that it is difficult to determine the RI setup. While RC is always performed, the situation is different for RI (or no-rel). Sometimes RI is clearly not done (i.e., the paper assumes a scenario in which every instance contains at least one relation), but most of the times it is either not clear from the paper, or done in a simplified scenario (e.g., datasets which already clear out most of the no-rel entity pair instances). As this blurriness hampers fair evaluation, we propose that studies clearly state which step they include, i.e., whether the work focus is on RC, RI+RC or the full RE pipeline and how special cases (no-rel and NOTA) are handled. These details are utterly important as they impact both model estimation and evaluation.

(p2.2) Pipeline or Joint Model? The traditional RE pipeline is, by definition of pipeline, prone to error propagation by sub-tasks. Joint entity and relation extraction approaches have been proposed in order to alleviate this problem (Miwa and Bansal, 2016;Zhang et al., 2017a;Bekoulis et al., 2018a,b;Wang and Lu, 2020;Wang et al., 2021). However, Taillé et al. (2020) recently discussed the challenge of properly evaluating such complex models. They surveyed the evaluation metrics of recently published works on end-to-end RE referring to the Strict, Boundaries, Relaxed evaluation setting pro-  posed by Bekoulis et al. (2018a). They observe unfair comparisons and overestimations of end-toend models, and claim the need for more rigorous reports of evaluation settings, including detailed datasets statistics. While some recent work shifts to joint models, it is still an open question which approach (joint or pipeline) is the most robust.

What are the primary strategies for uncertainty sampling in active learning for NLP?","The primary strategies for uncertainty sampling in active learning for natural language processing (NLP) include entropy-based, least-confidence, and margin-sampling strategies. These strategies are favored for their ability to identify instances where the model's predictions are most uncertain.

Least-confidence sampling, proposed by Culotta and McCallum (2005), prioritizes instances for which the model has the lowest confidence in its prediction. Margin-sampling, discussed by Scheffer et al. (2001) and Schein and Ungar (2007), selects instances based on the smallest difference between the model's two most probable predictions.
