Attention to [CLS] is easy to interpret as attention to an aggregated sentence-level representation, but BERT also attends a lot to [SEP] and punctuation.

[SEP] gets increased attention starting in layer 5, but its importance for prediction drops.

How do BERT's self-attention heads contribute to understanding its model behavior?,"Questions:

1. How do BERT's self-attention heads contribute to understanding its model behavior?

Answer:

(p7.0) Attention is widely considered to be useful for understanding Transformer models, and several studies proposed classification of attention head types:

(p7.1) • attending to the word itself, to previous/next words and to the end of the sentence (Raganato and Tiedemann, 2018);

(p7.2) • attending to previous/next tokens,    (Kovaleva et al., 2019) According to Clark et al. (2019), ""attention weight has a clear meaning: how much a particular word will be weighted when computing the next representation for the current word"". However, Kovaleva et al. (2019) showed that most selfattention heads do not directly encode any nontrivial linguistic information, since less than half of them had the ""heterogeneous"" pattern 2 . Much of the model encoded the vertical pattern (attention to [CLS], [SEP], and punctuation tokens), consistent with the observations by Clark et al. (2019). This apparent redundancy must be related to the overparametrization issue (see section 7).

(p7.3) Attention to [CLS] is easy to interpret as attention to an aggregated sentence-level representation, but BERT also attends a lot to [SEP] and punctuation. Clark et al. (2019) hypothesize that periods and commas are simply almost as frequent as [CLS] and [SEP], and the model learns to rely on them. They suggest also that the function of [SEP] might be one of ""no-op"", a signal to ignore the head if its pattern is not applicable to the current case.

(p7.4) [SEP] gets increased attention starting in layer 5, but its importance for prediction drops. If this hypothesis is correct, attention probing studies that excluded the [SEP] and [CLS] tokens (as e.g.  and Htut et al. (2019)) should perhaps be revisited.

(p7.5) Proceeding to the analysis of the ""heterogeneous"" self-attention pattern, a number of studies looked for specific BERT heads with linguistically interpretable functions.

(p7.6) Some BERT heads seem to specialize in certain types of syntactic relations. Htut et al.

Different methods to generate the structure have been investigated, e.g. SVMs (Habernal and Gurevych, 2017;Niculae et al., 2017) or textual entailment (Cabrio and Villata, 2013;Cocarascu et al., 2020). Modeling the relations and argumentation flow within a debate is an important factor when defining the notion of argument quality, which will be presented in Section 3.

Consider the following example taken from an online debate about compulsory vaccinations 3 which demonstrates the framework quite clearly. Given a statement presenting background and context, participants are asked to discuss the question ""Does public health demand vaccinations?"" (Claims are in bold, and premises are underlined.) A1: A vaccine is the best way to prevent an outbreak of a disease or to reduce its negative effects. Vaccinated people become immune to a certain pathogen and do not develop a disease. Although there are occasionally side effects, these affect only a tiny number of people compared to the protection offered to the vast majority.

A2: Many vaccines have serious and sometimes deadly side effects. With many vaccines the immunity is not lifelong. Sometimes the vaccines itself can cause a serious disease to develop as a side effect. If governments know that compulsory mass vaccination is likely to cause death or permanent disability in even a few cases, it is immoral for them to make it compulsory.

Here, the argumentative text boundaries are first determined from the natural language discussion and the argument components (claims and premises) are extracted. Then, the relations between the two arguments are as follows: A 1 supports the argument while A 2 attacks it. However, consider another example, extracted from an online debate platform Kialo 4 . Here, the participants' contribution and the structure mirror a more direct and conversational dynamic to argumentation.

A1: Marvel Universe is better than DC Universe.

A2: Stan Lee's vision contains clarity and purpose, while DC is simply interested in churning entertainment to the masses.

A3: Stan Lee no-longer has control over any of marvel, which can cloud the purpose of Marvel due to it being owned by Disney.

A4: This is especially true due to his unfortunate passing.

A5: DC has been more apt to recycle parts of Intellectual Property, they even made an entire movie using the ideas of the 1960's characters and comics.

The seemingly simple example of an online exchange shows how a more conversational environment provides vaguer boundaries of argumentation structure and components. Each argument is more direct, not necessarily consisting of a claimpremise configuration, and the strength and productive quality of each argument is particularly relative to the context, each contribution affecting the argument differently either at a local or global level. Note, however, that the relations between arguments and claim are still relatively clear (e.g. A 2 supports while A 5 attacks the main claim in A 1 ; A 3 attacks A 2 directly; and A 4 closes any further 4 https://www.kialo.com/explore/ featured discussion on A 3 's premise).

Clearly, the environment and type of platform under consideration have a significant impact on a system's capacity to implement such a framework and on the degree of complexity found in the components and relations to extract, assign, and predict. Working in the realm of overtly argumentative text (such as persuasive essays (Stab and Gurevych, 2017)), while challenging of course, can be quite standardized. The language use is generally in line with natural language expectations and often standard (e.g. claim, premise and stance are clear), the structure and collective goal of the debate are rather controlled and topic-specific, and the collection of participants involved is often a closed or an easilyclassified set (e.g. in parliamentary debates, news forums, etc.).",What are the stages involved in the argument mining framework and how do they function?,1.

1. What are the stages involved in the argument mining framework and how do they function?

Answer:

(p2.0) Cabrio and Villata (2018) provide an elaborate overview of the AM framework in their data-driven analysis of the state of the art after five years of significant developments in the field of AM. Generally speaking, given a collection of natural language texts, the task at hand is implemented in two stages: Argument extraction The system first identifies the documents which contain the argumentative structure and the specific textual spans in which argumentation is encoded. Once the textual boundaries are defined, subportions of the argumentative spans are assigned to a set of pre-established argument components (e.g. claims, premises, rebuttal, etc.). A variety of models were used for this including Näive Bayes (Moens et al., 2007), SVMs (Mochales andMoens, 2011), RNNs (Niculae et al., 2017;Eger et al., 2017), Pre-trained Language Models (Chakrabarty et al., 2019;Lugini and Litman, 2020), and other supervised-learning techniques (Ein-Dor et al., 2020).

(p2.1) Relation assignment The goal of the second stage is to model the relations between the argumentative spans identified in the first stage. These relations can exist between different arguments (support, attack) as well as within an argument (connecting the premises with the claim). Recent approaches to argumentative relation classification investigate for example relational models (Trautmann et al., 2020) or inject background knowledge by leveraging features from different knowledge bases (Kobbe et al., 2019). Detecting these relations is necessary to model the overall structure of the argumentation (discourse/debate). As this structure can be complex, the task is difficult, involving high-level knowledge representation and reasoning issues. After the relations are detected, the discourse structure can then be mapped to a graph representation, called argumentation graph, with the arguments as nodes and relations as edges.

This approach is shown to perform well for classifying argument stance and detecting evidence, but not for predicting argument quality scores. Multilingual stance detection in political social media text (Vamvas and Sennrich, 2020) is also investigated in Lai et al.

This is a general issue in NLP research that extends to performance bias in favor of standard dialects for example in English (Blodgett et al., 2016) and bias that could target certain user groups instead of protecting them as was shown for Hate Speech Detection (Davidson et al., 2019).

1. What are the main challenges in scaling up argument mining on social media and multilingual contexts?

Answer:

(p3.0) In social media While overtly argumentative text, like those described above, represents the natural domain of application for AM, social media constitute a powerful source of large amounts of data (billions of words) despite facing particular challenges in AM.

(p3.1) Social media plays an increasingly significant role in modern political and social discourse, yet resources built for conducting AM on this type of data structure remain limited for clear reasons. These platforms inherently collect and spread a wide range of content, including personal opinions, facts, fake news, and additional information of interest to users. Distinguishing between personal opinion, fact, and fake news, for example, is not always straightforward, as seen in recent work on fake news detection (Kotonya and Toni, 2020). Further, the language used on such platforms is infamously chaotic and often non-standard in comparison to the language use in more structured environments, like parliamentary debates. The combination of these aspects introduces the unique challenge of implementing AM to particularly heterogeneous, poorly annotated data.

(p3.2) Recent work has aimed to tackle such challenges in social media. Dusmanu et al. (2017) apply a supervised classification approach to identify arguments on Twitter, focusing on the tasks of facts recognition and source identification. They study the feasibility of the approaches proposed to address these tasks on a set of tweets related to the Grexit and Brexitnews topics. Habernal and Gurevych (2017) provide an extensive analysis of the steps and the modeling strategies necessary to analyze social media data (e.g. forum posts) in terms of their argumentative structure, while Simpson and Gurevych (2018) tackle the issue of the scalability of AM algorithms.

(p3.3) Despite the rising attention and developments to AM in social media, one of the major challenges currently facing the field is the lack of consensus on how exactly to analyse argumentative user-generated texts such as online comments (Bauwelinck and Lefever, 2020). On the one hand, the amount of annotations available for the scale of this heterogeneous data remains limited. Recent work by Schaefer and Stede (2020), among others, have aimed to construct large Twitter corpora annotated for argument components, including argumentative spans within tweets. On the other hand, annotation guidelines are not necessarily clear, and the theoretical motivations underlying the proposed guidelines used to generate labelled corpora rarely include motivation for the use of a particular theoretical basis. Bauwelinck and Lefever (2020) introduce a pilot study and aim to provide a clear justification of the theories and definitions underlying the design of a set of guidelines.

(p3.4) The linguistic, structural, and logistic complexity and ""openness"" of such platforms clearly present unique challenges. However, being able to work well with argumentative text from social media and discussion forums is essential considering the continuously growing impact on the political and social framework of modern times.

Section 2.1); a complex task that aims to predict the relations holding between the arguments defined in the first stage. Being able to model the relations between arguments and components within the structure, for example in argument graphs (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016), allows us to actually work with the argumentative text in an applicationbased setting, understand the stance and context of arguments, and develop a story for the consequential impact of arguments on the discourse, among other things. Generally speaking, we can use this task as an approach to analyze argument quality (AQ). However, within the AM community, an open question concerns the adequate definition and operationalization of the notion of AQ. Despite this, to move forward with the task of AQ analysis and to create large corpora with crowd-sourced annotations, some approaches rely on the relative assessment of quality: Given two arguments, which is more convincing? (Habernal and Gurevych, 2016;Toledo et al., 2019;Gretz et al., 2020) Thus the natural way of quantifying the success of an argument is in terms of its persuasiveness. Indeed, plenty of previous work has explored the many factors which contribute to the persuasiveness of a message: the linguistic features employed by the authors (Persing and Ng, 2017), the semantic type of claims and premises (Hidey et al., 2017), the different sources of evidence produced to support an argument (Addawood and Bashir, 2016), the effects of the personality traits and prior beliefs on persuasiveness (Lukin et al., 2017;Durmus and Cardie, 2018;Al Khatib et al., 2020), the interaction with other participants (Ji et al., 2018;Egawa et al., 2020), the use of argument invention when debating about unknown topics (Bilu et al., 2019), the structure of the arguments (Li et al., 2020), and the effect of the style of the text in achieving persuasion (El Baff et al., 2020).', 'Persuasiveness is, however, not the only way to define whether an argument is good -at least not from a deliberation point of view.

Other aspects of AQ have become the subject of AM research such as the relevance and impact of arguments (Durmus et al., 2019), the verifiability (Park and Cardie, 2018), local acceptability (Yang et al., 2019) and the best ""deliberative move"" (Al-Khatib et al., 2018).', 'We argue that this shift is necessary for two reasons: (1) Working with real-world applications of AM naturally forces us into the more heterogeneous realm of data structures, such as social media, in which language, structure, and content are less uniform and confined to the classic notion of logical debate; and (2) In order to encourage deliberation from an open audience of citizens, we need to redefine our concept of AQ and productive discourse such that there is equal worth and participation granted to each contributor of the argument.', 'Deliberative Quality We therefore propose adapting the definition of quality to integrate the abundant research on the topic from the field of Social Sciences.

The focus here is not on the quality of the individual contributions. Instead, an overall quality of the discourse is determined by the fact that the individual quality dimensions are distributed among different contributions (e.g some participants do more rational reasoning, others share personal experiences). We would like to integrate those aspects that focus on inclusivity and cooperation.', 'Similar to Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), social scientists have developed a taxonomy, the discourse quality index (DQI), that describes the different desirable aspects of a discourse (Steenbergen et al., 2003). This taxonomy has been used to analyze the quality of deliberation in different contexts, ranging from more formal contexts, such as parliamentary debates (Steiner et al., 2005), to informal discussions in online forums (Trénel, 2004). Both implementations integrate logical coherence as one dimension, cogency in Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), justification in the DQI. Some aspects of inclusivity are also being touched upon in the rhetorical and dialectical dimension of Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), such as using appropriate language (Appropriateness) or whether an argument supports conflict resolution (global relevance). We concentrate on the following dimensions from the DQI, which particularly focus on the collaborative aspect of discourse.', '• Respect: this dimension includes respectful tone, respect for other social groups/backgrounds, and openness towards other opinions.', '• Equality / Participation: it is not desirable that some dominant participants make the bulk of contributions while many others remain passive.

We argue that this shift is necessary for two reasons: (1) Working with real-world applications of AM naturally forces us into the more heterogeneous realm of data structures, such as social media, in which language, structure, and content are less uniform and confined to the classic notion of logical debate; and (2) In order to encourage deliberation from an open audience of citizens, we need to redefine our concept of AQ and productive discourse such that there is equal worth and participation granted to each contributor of the argument.

Summing up The overview of the definitions of AQ along with the discussion of the potential of the integration of Deliberative Quality features into an AM framework has one strong take-home message:

The need for the scope of the investigation to go beyond (a) the persuasiveness of a an argumentative text (speeches, forum posts, tweets), and (b) their relation to the immediate preceding discourse. Instead, we pointed out the need to also assess the potential of the impact of that argumentative text on the upcoming discourse: this dimension of quality, inherently related to the interpretation of argumentation as a cooperation challenge, is currently lacking in current approaches to AQ.","(p4.0) The second stage in the framework of AM is defined as relation assignment (c.f.

This new definition has been the basis for the creation of new corpora from different domains , where feature-based (Wachsmuth and Werner, 2020) and neural models were tested for automatic prediction . Other aspects of AQ have become the subject of AM research such as the relevance and impact of arguments (Durmus et al., 2019), the verifiability (Park and Cardie, 2018), local acceptability (Yang et al., 2019) and the best ""deliberative move"" (Al-Khatib et al., 2018).

(p4.3) We argue that this shift is necessary for two reasons: (1) Working with real-world applications of AM naturally forces us into the more heterogeneous realm of data structures, such as social media, in which language, structure, and content are less uniform and confined to the classic notion of logical debate; and (2) In order to encourage deliberation from an open audience of citizens, we need to redefine our concept of AQ and productive discourse such that there is equal worth and participation granted to each contributor of the argument.

(p4.4) Deliberative Quality We therefore propose adapting the definition of quality to integrate the abundant research on the topic from the field of Social Sciences. Here, the quality of a discourse has been investigated in the context of deliberation with the focus on inclusivity: how can the interplay of the different participants in the discourse lead to an optimal outcome for the collective? The focus here is not on the quality of the individual contributions. Instead, an overall quality of the discourse is determined by the fact that the individual quality dimensions are distributed among different contributions (e.g some participants do more rational reasoning, others share personal experiences). We would like to integrate those aspects that focus on inclusivity and cooperation.

(p4.5) Similar to Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), social scientists have developed a taxonomy, the discourse quality index (DQI), that describes the different desirable aspects of a discourse (Steenbergen et al., 2003). This taxonomy has been used to analyze the quality of deliberation in different contexts, ranging from more formal contexts, such as parliamentary debates (Steiner et al., 2005), to informal discussions in online forums (Trénel, 2004). Both implementations integrate logical coherence as one dimension, cogency in Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), justification in the DQI. Some aspects of inclusivity are also being touched upon in the rhetorical and dialectical dimension of Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), such as using appropriate language (Appropriateness) or whether an argument supports conflict resolution (global relevance). We concentrate on the following dimensions from the DQI, which particularly focus on the collaborative aspect of discourse.

(p4.6) • Respect: this dimension includes respectful tone, respect for other social groups/backgrounds, and openness towards other opinions.

(p4.7) • Equality / Participation: it is not desirable that some dominant participants make the bulk of contributions while many others remain passive. All participants should have equal opportunities to contribute and all topics, including those that DQI (Steenbergen et al., 2003)  • Interactivity: beyond simply sharing opinions, acknowledging other viewpoints and interacting with other participants through listening and responding lead to new perspectives arising -compromises can emerge.

(p4.8) • Testimoniality / Report of personal accounts:

(p4.9) sharing stories and personal narratives as an alternative form of communication can involve more people in the discourse, especially those who cannot identify themselves with rational argumentation. It can also make other participants aware of other perspectives as it generally increases empathy. Especially when traditional or universal norms need to be questioned, narratives are particularly well suited, as their ambiguity and vagueness creates room for interpretation. This is particularly important when new ideas or perspectives are introduced, since they cannot yet be rationally articulated. Table 1 establishes a direct comparison between discourse quality dimensions of the DQI (Steenbergen et al., 2003;Steiner et al., 2005) and argument quality dimensions as defined in Wachsmuth et al. (2017b). Apart from the potential theoretical insights, the existing guidelines can be applied to annotate new or enrich existing corpora for AM. Despite the small size, the data already annotated based on the DQI can be made usable and extended for NLP. In addition, some of the quality dimensions can be further quantified or approximated using statistical methods. For example, interactivity or equality can be assessed with frequency-based methods, such as frequency of posts by distinct participants and response rate.

(p4.10) Summing up The overview of the definitions of AQ along with the discussion of the potential of the integration of Deliberative Quality features into an AM framework has one strong take-home message:

(p4.11) The need for the scope of the investigation to go beyond (a) the persuasiveness of a an argumentative text (speeches, forum posts, tweets), and (b) their relation to the immediate preceding discourse. Instead, we pointed out the need to also assess the potential of the impact of that argumentative text on the upcoming discourse: this dimension of quality, inherently related to the interpretation of argumentation as a cooperation challenge, is currently lacking in current approaches to AQ.","[['b6', 'b9', 'b23', 'b36', None, 'b27', 'b47'], [], ['b56', 'b33', None, 'b55', 'b61'], [], [], ['b50', 'b55', 'b46', 'b45'], [], ['b45'], [], ['b46', 'b55', 'b45'], [], []]","[['b6', 'b9', 'b23', 'b36', None, 'b27', 'b47'], [], ['b56', 'b33', None, 'b55', 'b61'], [], [], ['b50', 'b55', 'b46', 'b45'], [], ['b45'], [], ['b46', 'b55', 'b45'], [], []]",20,"1. The second stage in the framework of AM is defined as relation assignment (c.f. Section 2.1); a complex task that aims to predict the relations holding between the arguments defined in the first stage.
2. Being able to model the relations between arguments and components within the structure, for example in argument graphs (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016), allows us to actually work with the argumentative text in an applicationbased setting, understand the stance and context of arguments, and develop a story for the consequential impact of arguments on the discourse, among other things.
3. Generally speaking, we can use this task as an approach to analyze argument quality (AQ).
4. However, within the AM community, an open question concerns the adequate definition and operationalization of the notion of AQ.
5. Despite this, to move forward with the task of AQ analysis and to create large corpora with crowd-sourced annotations, some approaches rely on the relative assessment of quality: Given two arguments, which is more convincing?
6. (Habernal and Gurevych, 2016;Toledo et al., 2019;Gretz et al., 2020)
7. Thus the natural way of quantifying the success of an argument is in terms of its persuasiveness.
8. Indeed, plenty of previous work has explored the many factors which contribute to the persuasiveness of a message: the linguistic features employed by the authors (Persing and Ng, 2017), the semantic type of claims and premises (Hidey et al., 2017), the different sources of evidence produced to support an argument (Addawood and Bashir, 2016), the effects of the personality traits and prior beliefs on persuasiveness (Lukin et al., 2017;Durmus and Cardie, 2018;Al Khatib et al., 2020), the interaction with other participants (Ji et al., 2018;Egawa et al., 2020), the use of argument invention when debating about unknown topics (Bilu et al., 2019), the structure of the arguments (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016)0, and the effect of the style of the text in achieving persuasion (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016)1.
9. Persuasiveness is, however, not the only way to define whether an argument is good -at least not from a deliberation point of view.
10. A good contribution to a debate is one which uncovers a previously unnoticed aspect of a problem, thus generating a perturbation in the discourse (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016)2.
11. Or else, a good contribution is one that settles an issue, by stating the differences between opposing views and allowing the discourse to stabilize in a series of clusters (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016)3.
12. Most recent research projects (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016)4 aim to address the challenge of redefining the notion of AQ, away from persuasiveness and towards a more ""situated"" definition which has to do with the needs of argumentation in a real-world scenario.
13. This new definition has been the basis for the creation of new corpora from different domains , where feature-based (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016)5 and neural models were tested for automatic prediction .

Other aspects of AQ have become the subject of AM research such as the relevance and impact of arguments (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016)6, the verifiability (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016)7, local acceptability (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016)8 and the best ""deliberative move"" (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016)9.
15. We argue that this shift is necessary for two reasons: (AQ)0 Working with real-world applications of AM naturally forces us into the more heterogeneous realm of data structures, such as social media, in which language, structure, and content are less uniform and confined to the classic notion of logical debate; and

1. What factors influence the persuasiveness of an argument in argument mining?

Answer:

(p4.0) The second stage in the framework of AM is defined as relation assignment (c.f. Section 2.1); a complex task that aims to predict the relations holding between the arguments defined in the first stage. Being able to model the relations between arguments and components within the structure, for example in argument graphs (Besnard and Hunter, 2014; Craven and Toni, 2016), allows us to actually work with the argumentative text in an applicationbased setting, understand the stance and context of arguments, and develop a story for the consequential impact of arguments on the discourse, among other things. Generally speaking, we can use this task as an approach to analyze argument quality (AQ). However, within the AM community, an open question concerns the adequate definition and operationalization of the notion of AQ. Despite this, to move forward with the task of AQ analysis and to create large corpora with crowd-sourced annotations, some approaches rely on the relative assessment of quality: Given two arguments, which is more convincing? (Habernal and Gurevych, 2016;Toledo et al., 2019;Gretz et al., 2020) Thus the natural way of quantifying the success of an argument is in terms of its persuasiveness. Indeed, plenty of previous work has explored the many factors which contribute to the persuasiveness of a message: the linguistic features employed by the authors (Persing and Ng, 2017), the semantic type of claims and premises (Hidey et al., 2017), the different sources of evidence produced to support an argument (Addawood and Bashir, 2016), the effects of the personality traits and prior beliefs on persuasiveness (Lukin et al., 2017;Durmus and Cardie, 2018;Al Khatib et al., 2020), the interaction with other participants (Ji et al., 2018;Egawa et al., 2020), the use of argument invention when debating about unknown topics (Bilu et al., 2019), the structure of the arguments (Li et al., 2020), and the effect of the style of the text in achieving persuasion (El Baff et al., 2020).

(p4.1) Persuasiveness is, however, not the only way to define whether an argument is good -at least not from a deliberation point of view. A good contribution to a debate is one which uncovers a previously unnoticed aspect of a problem, thus generating a perturbation in the discourse (controversies can be productive!). Or else, a good contribution is one that settles an issue, by stating the differences between opposing views and allowing the discourse to stabilize in a series of clusters (convergence on just one position is not necessarily a good outcome).

(p4.2) Most recent research projects (Wachsmuth et al., 2017b) aim to address the challenge of redefining the notion of AQ, away from persuasiveness and towards a more ""situated"" definition which has to do with the needs of argumentation in a real-world scenario. This new definition has been the basis for the creation of new corpora from different domains , where feature-based (Wachsmuth and Werner, 2020) and neural models were tested for automatic prediction . Other aspects of AQ have become the subject of AM research such as the relevance and impact of arguments (Durmus et al., 2019), the verifiability (Park and Cardie, 2018), local acceptability (Yang et al., 2019) and the best ""deliberative move"" (Al-Khatib et al., 2018).

(p4.3) We argue that this shift is necessary for two reasons: (1) Working with real-world applications of AM naturally forces us into the more heterogeneous realm of data structures, such as social media, in which language, structure, and content are less uniform and confined to the classic notion of logical debate; and (2) In order to encourage deliberation from an open audience of citizens, we need to redefine our concept of AQ and productive discourse such that there is equal worth and participation granted to each contributor of the argument.

(p4.4) Deliberative Quality We therefore propose adapting the definition of quality to integrate the abundant research on the topic from the field of Social Sciences. Here, the quality of a discourse has been investigated in the context of deliberation with the focus on inclusivity: how can the interplay of the different participants in the discourse lead to an optimal outcome for the collective? The focus here is not on the quality of the individual contributions. Instead, an overall quality of the discourse is determined by the fact that the individual quality dimensions are distributed among different contributions (e.g some participants do more rational reasoning, others share personal experiences). We would like to integrate those aspects that focus on inclusivity and cooperation.

(p4.5) Similar to Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), social scientists have developed a taxonomy, the discourse quality index (DQI), that describes the different desirable aspects of a discourse (Steenbergen et al., 2003). This taxonomy has been used to analyze the quality of deliberation in different contexts, ranging from more formal contexts, such as parliamentary debates (Steiner et al., 2005), to informal discussions in online forums (Trénel, 2004). Both implementations integrate logical coherence as one dimension, cogency in Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), justification in the DQI. Some aspects of inclusivity are also being touched upon in the rhetorical and dialectical dimension of Wachsmuth et al. (2017b), such as using appropriate language (Appropriateness) or whether an argument supports conflict resolution (global relevance). We concentrate on the following dimensions from the DQI, which particularly focus on the collaborative aspect of discourse.

(p4.6) • Respect: this dimension includes respectful tone, respect for other social groups/backgrounds, and openness towards other opinions.

(p4.7) • Equality / Participation: it is not desirable that some dominant participants make the bulk of contributions while many others remain passive. All participants should have equal opportunities to contribute and all topics, including those that DQI (Steenbergen et al., 2003)  • Interactivity: beyond simply sharing opinions, acknowledging other viewpoints and interacting with other participants through listening and responding lead to new perspectives arising -compromises can emerge.

(p4.8) • Testimoniality / Report of personal accounts:

(p4.9) sharing stories and personal narratives as an alternative form of communication can involve more people in the discourse, especially those who cannot identify themselves with rational argumentation. It can also make other participants aware of other perspectives as it generally increases empathy. Especially when traditional or universal norms need to be questioned, narratives are particularly well suited, as their ambiguity and vagueness creates room for interpretation. This is particularly important when new ideas or perspectives are introduced, since they cannot yet be rationally articulated. Table 1 establishes a direct comparison between discourse quality dimensions of the DQI (Steenbergen et al., 2003;Steiner et al., 2005) and argument quality dimensions as defined in Wachsmuth et al. (2017b). Apart from the potential theoretical insights, the existing guidelines can be applied to annotate new or enrich existing corpora for AM. Despite the small size, the data already annotated based on the DQI can be made usable and extended for NLP. In addition, some of the quality dimensions can be further quantified or approximated using statistical methods. For example, interactivity or equality can be assessed with frequency-based methods, such as frequency of posts by distinct participants and response rate.

(p4.10) Summing up The overview of the definitions of AQ along with the discussion of the potential of the integration of Deliberative Quality features into an AM framework has one strong take-home message:

(p4.11) The need for the scope of the investigation to go beyond (a) the persuasiveness of a an argumentative text (speeches, forum posts, tweets), and (b) their relation to the immediate preceding discourse. Instead, we pointed out the need to also assess the potential of the impact of that argumentative text on the upcoming discourse: this dimension of quality, inherently related to the interpretation of argumentation as a cooperation challenge, is currently lacking in current approaches to AQ.","Towards Argument Mining for Social Good: A Survey##

The use of a single Spanish word in an English tweet (ex. 2) is not as syntactically complicated as the integration in ex. 1. In fact, it may not signal multilingualism at all, simply borrowing. Many words, particularly anglicisms, circulate globally: marketing, feedback, gay.', ""2. This is a good baile! 'This is a good dance party!'

But, to produce example (1), the speaker has to know what word order and case marker to use, and which languages they should be drawn from. NLP scholars are not always concerned with the difference between examples (1) and (2) so that, with some exceptions (Bhat et al., 2016), grammatical work in NLP tends to rely heavily on the notion of a matrix language model advanced by Joshi (1982) and later adapted by Myers-Scotton (1997) as the Matrix Language Frame (MLF) model. The MLF holds that one language provides the grammatical frame into which words or phrases from another are embedded and its scope of application is a clause.

Testing such theories in NLP experiments would require syntactically parsed corpora that are rare for mixed language data (Partanen et al., 2018). In sum, working together, theoretical and computational linguists could create better tools for processing C-S than those currently available.

(p1.5) 3 Why do speakers code-switch?

(p1.6) In addition to focusing on the linguistic aspects and constraints on C-S, linguists are also interested in the social and cognitive motivations for switching across languages. What a (multilingual) speaker is trying to achieve by switching languages can affect its structural outcome. Linguists recognize that pragmatic, interactional, and socio-indexical functions may condition C-S patterns. For instance, Myslín and Levy (2015) demonstrate that Czech-English speakers switch to English for highinformation content words in prominent prosodic positions when speaking Czech. Other uses of C-S with structural traces include signalling an in-group identity through backflagging (Muysken, 1995) or emblematic tag-switching (Poplack, 1980). These are words or phrases that are used at the edge of clauses (e.g., Spanish ojalá or English so). Other functions, among these, quoting a speaker, getting the attention of an interlocutor, or reiterating an utterance to soften or intensify a message will also be indicated via C-S in predictable linguistic constructions, such as with verbs of 'saying', vocative expressions, and sequential translation equivalents (Gumperz, 1982;Zentella, 1997).

(p1.7) According to Clyne (1991), there are eight factors (e.g. topic, type of interaction, interlocutors, role relationship, communication channel) that can influence C-S choices. Lavric (2007) explains C-S choices in line with politeness theory, focusing on prestige and face-saving moves in multilingual conversations. Heller (1992) takes a macro-social view, arguing that French-English C-S in Quebec may signal a political choice among both dominant and subordinate groups. Gardner-Chloros and Edwards (2004) suggest that social factors influence language choice, with different generations of speakers from the same community exhibiting very different C-S patterns. Similarly Sebba (1998) argues that as speakers cognitively construct equivalence between morphemes, words, and phrases across their languages, communities of the same languages may do this differently. Evidence from computational studies suggests that C-S is speaker-dependent (Vu et al., 2013). Gender and identity also play a role for C-S practices in English and Greek Cypriot community in London (Finnis, 2014). From a computational perspective, Papalexakis et al. (2014) investigated the factors that influence C-S choices (Turkish-Dutch) in computer mediated interaction and how to predict them 1656 automatically.","A Survey of Code-switching: Linguistic and Social Perspectives for Language Technologies##

1. What linguistic considerations are crucial in analyzing code-switching phenomena?

Answer:

(p1.0) For linguists, the specific ways in which languages are switched matters. The use of a single Spanish word in an English tweet (ex. 2) is not as syntactically complicated as the integration in ex. 1. In fact, it may not signal multilingualism at all, simply borrowing. Many words, particularly anglicisms, circulate globally: marketing, feedback, gay.

(p1.1) 2. This is a good baile! 'This is a good dance party!' (Solorio and Liu, 2008) To produce example (2), the speaker needs to know only one Spanish word. But, to produce example (1), the speaker has to know what word order and case marker to use, and which languages they should be drawn from. NLP scholars are not always concerned with the difference between examples (1) and (2) so that, with some exceptions (Bhat et al., 2016), grammatical work in NLP tends to rely heavily on the notion of a matrix language model advanced by Joshi (1982) and later adapted by Myers-Scotton (1997) as the Matrix Language Frame (MLF) model. The MLF holds that one language provides the grammatical frame into which words or phrases from another are embedded and its scope of application is a clause. Thus, it would not apply to the alternational English-Afrikaans C-S in example (3) as each clause is in a separate language (Dulm, 2007).

(p1.2) 3. I love Horlicks maar hierś niks 'I love Horlicks but there's nothing there '

(p1.3) Although it dominates computational approaches to C-S, the MLF is contested on empirical and theoretical grounds. The consistent identification of a matrix language is not always possible, the criteria for defining it are ambiguous, and its scope is limited (Meakins, 2012;Bhat et al., 2016;Adamou, 2016;MacSwan, 2000;Auer and Muhamedova, 2005). Bullock et al. (2018) computationally show that different ways of determining the matrix language only reliably converge over sentences with simple insertions as in example (2).

(p1.4) For many linguists, the MLF is not the only way, or even an adequate way, to theorize C-S. The Equivalence Constraint (Poplack, 1980) captures the fact that C-S tends to occur at points where the linear structures of the contributing languages coincide, as when the languages involved share word order. Other syntactic theories are built on the differences between lexical and functional elements, including the Government Constraint (DiSciullo et al., 1986) and the Functional Head Constraint (Belazi et al., 1994). Incorporating the latter in NLP experiments has been shown to improve the accuracy of computational and speech models (Li and Fung, 2014;Bhat et al., 2016). Functional elements include negative particles and auxiliaries, which are respectively classified as Adverbs and Verbs (lexical classes), in some NLP tag sets (Al-Ghamdi et al., 2016). This means that NLP experiments often use annotations that are too coarse to be linguistically informative with regard to C-S.

While C-S implies active alternation between grammatical systems, borrowing does not. It is difficult to know if a lone word insertion (e.g. example (2)) constitutes a borrowing or a C-S without considering how the items are integrated into the grammar of the receiving language (Poplack et al., 1988). When such analyses are done, most lone-item insertions are analyzable as one-time borrowings, called nonce borrowings (Sankoff et al., 1990). Similarly, what looks like complex C-S may not be perceived as switching at all. Auer (1999) distinguishes a continuum of mixing types: prototypical C-S is pragmatic and intentional, Language Mixing serves no pragmatic purpose, and Mixed Languages are the single code of a community. These can look structurally identical, but the latter can be modeled as a single language (e.g. languages like Michif Cree (Bakker, 1997) or Gurinji Kriol (Meakins, 2012)) rather than the intertwining of two.

C-S among immigrant community members have also been widely studied in Germany (e.g. Turkish-German C-S by Keim (2008) and Ç etinoglu (2017), Russian-German C-S by Khakimov (2016)). In the Netherlands, C-S studies include Turkish-Dutch C-S by Backus (2010) and Dutch-Morroccan C-S by Nortier (1990). In Belgium, Meeuws and Blommaert (1998) studied the French-Lingala-Swahili C-S among immigrants of Zaire and Treffers-Daller (1994) studied French-Dutch C-S in Brussels. In Spain, Jieanu (2013) describes the Romanian-Spanish C-S among the Romanian immigrants. In addition to the C-S analyses within spoken interactions of immigrant communities across Europe, there are also studies about C-S within computer mediated communication as well. These studies include Greek-German C-S by Androutsopoulos (2015) in Germany, Turkish-Dutch C-S by Papalexakis et al. (2014), Papalexakis and Dogruöz (2015) and a comparison of Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch C-S by Dorleijn and Nortier (2009) in the Netherlands. Similarly, Marley (2011) compared French-Arabic C-S within computer mediated interaction across Moroccan communities in France and the UK.

(p3.4) In addition to daily communication, some linguists are also interested in the C-S observed in historical documents. While Swain (2002) explored Latin-Greek C-S by Cicero (Roman Statesman), Dunkel (2000) analyzed C-S in his communication with Atticus (Roman philosopher who studied in Athens) in the Roman Empire. Argenter (2001) reports cases of language mixing within the Catalan Jewish community (in Spain) in the 14th and 15th centuries and Rothman (2011) highlights the C-S between Italian, Slavic and Turkish in the historical documents about Ottoman-Venetian relations.

(p3.5) Within the media context, Martin (1998) investigated English C-S in written French advertising, and Onysko (2007) investigated the English C-S in German written media through corpus analyses.

(p3.3) C-S is commonly observable across immigrant contexts in Europe.

Wei and Milroy (1995) analyzed the C-S between English and Chinese from a conversational analysis point of view based on the interactions of bilingual (Chinese-English) families in Northeastern England. In addition, Ożańska-Ponikwia (2016) investigated the Polish-English C-S in the UK as well. C-S among immigrant community members have also been widely studied in Germany (e.g. Turkish-German C-S by Keim (2008) and Ç etinoglu (2017), Russian-German C-S by Khakimov (2016)). In the Netherlands, C-S studies include Turkish-Dutch C-S by Backus (2010) and Dutch-Morroccan C-S by Nortier (1990). In Belgium, Meeuws and Blommaert (1998) studied the French-Lingala-Swahili C-S among immigrants of Zaire and Treffers-Daller (1994) studied French-Dutch C-S in Brussels. In Spain, Jieanu (2013) describes the Romanian-Spanish C-S among the Romanian immigrants. In addition to the C-S analyses within spoken interactions of immigrant communities across Europe, there are also studies about C-S within computer mediated communication as well. These studies include Greek-German C-S by Androutsopoulos (2015) in Germany, Turkish-Dutch C-S by Papalexakis et al.

(p3.4) In addition to daily communication, some linguists are also interested in the C-S observed in historical documents.

C-S across Languages: European Context##
The contexts in which people acquire and use multiple languages in Europe are diverse. Some acquire their languages simultaneously from birth, while others acquire them sequentially, either naturally or via explicit instruction. Multilingualism is the norm in many zones where local residents may speak different languages to accommodate their interlocutors. Speakers who use local dialects or minoritized varieties may also be engaged in C-S when switching between their variety and a dominant one (Mills and Washington, 2015;Blom and Gumperz, 1972). C-S in bilingual language acquisition of children has been studied across language contact contexts in Europe. In Germany, Herkenrath (2012) and Pfaff (1999) focused on Turkish-German C-S and Meisel (1994) on German-French C-S of bilingual children. From a comparative perspective, Poeste et al. (2019) analyzed C-S among bilingual, trilingual, and multilingual children growing up in Spain and Germany. In the Netherlands, Bosma and Blom (2019) focused on C-S among bilingual Frisian-Dutch children. In addition to analyzing C-S in children's speech, Juan-Garau and Perez-Vidal (2001) and Lanza (1998) investigated C-S in the interaction patterns between bilingual children and their parents (i.e. Spanish-Catalan and English-Norwegian respectively).##

Most strategies either add slightly modified copies of existing data or create synthetic data, aiming for the augmented data to act as a regularizer and reduce overfitting when training ML models (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019;Hernández-García and König, 2020). DA has been commonly used in CV, where techniques like cropping, flipping, and color jittering are a standard component of model training. In NLP, where the input space is discrete, how to generate effective augmented examples that capture the desired invariances is less obvious.

(p1.1) What are the goals and trade-offs? Despite challenges associated with text, many DA techniques for NLP have been proposed, ranging from rule-based manipulations (Zhang et al., 2015) to more complicated generative approaches (Liu et al., 2020b). As DA aims to provide an alternative to collecting more data, an ideal DA technique should be both easy-to-implement and improve model performance. Most offer trade-offs between these two.

(p1.2) Rule-based techniques are easy-to-implement but usually offer incremental performance improvements (Li et al., 2017;Wei and Zou, 2019;Wei et al., 2021b). Techniques leveraging trained models may be more costly to implement but introduce more data variation, leading to better performance boosts. Model-based techniques customized for downstream tasks can have strong effects on performance but be difficult to develop and utilize.

(p1.3) Further, the distribution of augmented data should neither be too similar nor too different from the original. This may lead to greater overfitting or poor performance through training on examples not representative of the given domain, respectively. Effective DA approaches should aim for a balance.

(p1.4) Kashefi and Hwa (2020) devise a KL-Divergence-based unsupervised procedure to preemptively choose among DA heuristics, rather than a typical ""run-all-heuristics"" comparison, which can be very time and cost intensive.

(p1.5) Interpretation of DA Dao et al. (2019) note that ""data augmentation is typically performed in an adhoc manner with little understanding of the underlying theoretical principles"", and claim the typical explanation of DA as regularization to be insufficient. Overall, there indeed appears to be a lack of research on why exactly DA works. Existing work on this topic is mainly surface-level, and rarely investigates the theoretical underpinnings and principles. We discuss this challenge more in §6, and highlight some of the existing work below. Bishop (1995) show training with noised examples is reducible to Tikhonov regularization (subsumes L2). Rajput et al. (2019) show that DA can increase the positive margin for classifiers, but only when augmenting exponentially many examples for common DA methods. Dao et al. (2019) think of DA transformations as kernels, and find two ways DA helps: averaging of features and variance regularization. Chen et al. (2020d) show that DA leads to variance reduction by averaging over orbits of the group that keep the data distribution approximately invariant.","A Survey of Data Augmentation Approaches for NLP##

In SOON (Zhu et al., 2021a), an agent receives a long, complex coarse-to-fine instruction which gradually narrows down the search scope.

(p3.3) Navigation+Object Interaction For some tasks, the target object might be hidden (e.g., the spoon in a drawer), or need to change status (e.g., a sliced apple is requested but only a whole apple is available). In these scenarios, it is necessary to interact with the objects to accomplish the task (e.g., opening the drawer or cutting the apple). Interactive Question Answering (IQA) requires the agent to navigate and sometimes to interact with objects to answer a given question. Based on indoor scenes in AI2-THOR (Kolve et al., 2017), Shridhar et al. (2020) propose the ALFRED dataset, where agents are provided with both coarse-grained and fine-grained instructions complete household tasks in an interactive visual environment. CHAI (Misra et al., 2018) requires the agent to navigate and simply interact with the environments."

The dataset is called ScienceIE and consists of 500 journal articles from the Computer Science, Material Sciences and Physics fields. The year after, Gábor et al. (2018) proposed a corpus for RC and RE made of abstracts of scientific papers from the ACL Anthology for SemEval-2018 Task 7. The data will be described in further detail in Section 4.1. Following the same line, Luan et al. (2018) published SCIERC, which is a scientific RE dataset further annotated for coreference resolution. It contains abstracts from scientific AI-related conferences. From the existing three scientific RE datasets summarized in Table 1, in our empirical investigation we focus on two (SemEval-2018 and SCIERC). We leave out ScienceIE as it focuses on keyphrase extraction and it contains two generic relations only.

(p1.4) The Wikipedia domain has been first introduced in 2013. Google released GoogleRE, 4 a RE corpus consisting of snippets from Wikipedia. More recently, Kassner et al. (2021) proposed mLAMA, a multilingual version (53 languages) of GoogleRE with the purpose of investigating knowledge in pretrained language models. The multi-lingual dimension is gaining more interest for RE. Following this trend, Seganti et al. (2021) presented SMiLER, a multilingual dataset (14 languages) from Wikipedia with relations belonging to nine domains.

(p1.5) Previous datasets were restricted to the same label collection in the training set and in the test set. To address this gap and make RE experimental scenarios more realistic, Han et al. (2018) -2007- Girju et al. (2007 Sentences from the web 7 SemEval-2010 Hendrickx et al. (2010) Sentences from the web 10 TACRED Zhang et al. (2017b) Newswire and web text 42 FSL TACRED Sabo et al. (2021) TACRED   Back to the news domain, Zhang et al. (2017b) published a large-scale RE dataset built over newswire and web text, by crowdsourcing relation annotations for sentences with named entity pairs. This resulted in the TACRED dataset with over 100k instances, which is particularly well-suited for neural models. Sabo et al. (2021) used TA-CRED to make a FSL RC dataset and compared it to FewRel 1.0 and FewRel 2.0, aiming at a more realistic scenario (i.e., non-uniform label distribution, inclusion of pronouns and common nouns).

(p1.6) All datasets so far present a sentence level annotation. To address this, Yao et al. (2019) published DocRED, a document-level RE dataset from Wikipedia and Wikidata. The difference with a traditional sentence-level corpus is that both the intraand inter-sentence relations are annotated, increasing the challenge level. In addition to RE, DocRED annotates coreference chains. DWIE by Zaporojets et al. (2021) is another document-level dataset, specifically designed for multi-task IE (Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Relation Extraction, and Entity Linking).

(p1.7) Lastly, there are works focusing on creating datasets for specific RE aspects. Cheng et al. (2021), for example, proposed a Chinese documentlevel RE dataset for hard cases in order to move towards even more challenging evaluation setups.

(p1.8) Domains in RE Given our analysis, we observe a shift in target domains: from news text in seminal works, over web texts, to emerging corpora in the scientific domain and the most recent focus on Wikipedia. Similarly, we observe the emerging trend for FSL.

(p1.9) Different datasets lend themselves to study different aspects of the task. Concerning crossdomain RE, we propose to distinguish three setups:

(p1.10) 1. Data from different domains, but same relation types, which are general enough to be present in each domain (limited and often confined to the ACE dataset) (e.g., Plank and Moschitti, 2013).

1. How have relation extraction datasets evolved in terms of domain diversity and annotation levels?

Answer:

(p1.0) RE has been broadly studied in the last decades and many datasets were published. We survey widely used RE datasets in chronological order, and broadly classify them into three domains based on the data source: (1) news and web, (2) scientific publications and (3) Wikipedia. An overview of the datasets is given in Table 1. Our empirical target here focuses on the scientific domain as so far it has received no attention in the cross-domain direction; a similar investigation on overlaps in data, annotation, and model transferability between datasets in other domains is interesting future work. The CoNLL 2004 dataset (Roth and Yih, 2004) is one of the first works. It contains annotations for named entities and relations in news articles. In the same year, the widely studied ACE dataset was published by Doddington et al. (2004). It contains annotated entities, relations and events in broadcast transcripts, newswire and newspaper data in English, Chinese and Arabic. The corpus is divided into six domains.

(p1.1) Another widely used dataset is The New York Times (NYT) Annotated Corpus, 3 first presented by Riedel et al. (2010). It contains over 1.8 million articles by the NYT between 1987 and 2007. NYT has been created with a distant supervision approach (Mintz et al., 2009), using Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008 as knowledge base. Two further versions of it followed recently: Zhu et al. (2020b) (NYT-H) and Jia et al. (2019) published manually annotated versions of the test set in order to perform a more accurate evaluation.

(p1.2) 3 http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/ecml/ RE has also been part of the SemEval shared tasks for four times so far. The two early Se-mEval shared tasks focused on the identification of semantic relations between nominals (Nastase et al., 2021). For SemEval-2007Task 4, Girju et al. (2007 released a dataset for RC into seven generic semantic relations between nominals. Three years later, for SemEval-2010 Task 8, Hendrickx et al. (2010) revised the annotation guidelines and published a corpus for RC, by providing a much larger dataset (10k instances, in comparison to 1.5k of the 2007 shared task).

(p1.3) Since 2017, three RE datasets in the scientific domain emerged, two of the three as SemEval shared tasks. In SemEval-2017 Task 10 Augenstein et al. (2017) proposed a dataset for the identification of keyphrases and considered two generic relations (HYPONYM-OF and SYNONYM-OF). The dataset is called ScienceIE and consists of 500 journal articles from the Computer Science, Material Sciences and Physics fields. The year after, Gábor et al. (2018) proposed a corpus for RC and RE made of abstracts of scientific papers from the ACL Anthology for SemEval-2018 Task 7. The data will be described in further detail in Section 4.1. Following the same line, Luan et al. (2018) published SCIERC, which is a scientific RE dataset further annotated for coreference resolution. It contains abstracts from scientific AI-related conferences. From the existing three scientific RE datasets summarized in Table 1, in our empirical investigation we focus on two (SemEval-2018 and SCIERC). We leave out ScienceIE as it focuses on keyphrase extraction and it contains two generic relations only.

(p1.4) The Wikipedia domain has been first introduced in 2013. Google released GoogleRE, 4 a RE corpus consisting of snippets from Wikipedia. More recently, Kassner et al. (2021) proposed mLAMA, a multilingual version (53 languages) of GoogleRE with the purpose of investigating knowledge in pretrained language models. The multi-lingual dimension is gaining more interest for RE. Following this trend, Seganti et al. (2021) presented SMiLER, a multilingual dataset (14 languages) from Wikipedia with relations belonging to nine domains.

(p1.5) Previous datasets were restricted to the same label collection in the training set and in the test set. To address this gap and make RE experimental scenarios more realistic, Han et al. (2018) -2007- Girju et al. (2007 Sentences from the web 7 SemEval-2010 Hendrickx et al. (2010) Sentences from the web 10 TACRED Zhang et al. (2017b) Newswire and web text 42 FSL TACRED Sabo et al. (2021) TACRED   Back to the news domain, Zhang et al. (2017b) published a large-scale RE dataset built over newswire and web text, by crowdsourcing relation annotations for sentences with named entity pairs. This resulted in the TACRED dataset with over 100k instances, which is particularly well-suited for neural models. Sabo et al. (2021) used TA-CRED to make a FSL RC dataset and compared it to FewRel 1.0 and FewRel 2.0, aiming at a more realistic scenario (i.e., non-uniform label distribution, inclusion of pronouns and common nouns).

(p1.6) All datasets so far present a sentence level annotation. To address this, Yao et al. (2019) published DocRED, a document-level RE dataset from Wikipedia and Wikidata. The difference with a traditional sentence-level corpus is that both the intraand inter-sentence relations are annotated, increasing the challenge level. In addition to RE, DocRED annotates coreference chains. DWIE by Zaporojets et al. (2021) is another document-level dataset, specifically designed for multi-task IE (Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Relation Extraction, and Entity Linking).

(p1.7) Lastly, there are works focusing on creating datasets for specific RE aspects. Cheng et al. (2021), for example, proposed a Chinese documentlevel RE dataset for hard cases in order to move towards even more challenging evaluation setups.

Starting from the raw text, the first step consists in identifying the entities and eventually assigning them a type. Entities involve either nominals or named entities, and hence it is either Named Entity Recognition (NER) or, more broadly, Mention Detection (MD). 5 After entities are identified, approaches start to be more blurry as studies have approached RE via different angles.', 'One way is to take two steps, Relation Identification (RI) and subsequent Relation Classification (RC) , as illustrated in Figure 2. This means to first identify from all the possible entity pairs the ones which are in some kind of relation via a binary classification task (RI). As the proportion of positive samples over the negative is usually extremely unbalanced towards the latter (Gormley et al., 2015), a priori heuristics are generally applied to reduce the possible combinations (e.g., entity pairs involving distant entities, or entity type pairs not licensed by the relations are not even considered). The last step (RC) is usually a multi-class classification to assign a relation type r to the positive samples from the previous step. Some studies merge RI and RC (Seganti et al., 2021) into one step, by adding a no-relation (no-rel) label. Other studies instead reduce the task to RC, and assume there exists a relation between two entities and the task is to determine the type (without a no-rel label). Regardless, RI is influenced by the RC setup: Relations which are not in the RC label set are considered as negative samples in the RI phase. Some studies address this approximation by distinguishing between the no-rel and the None-Of-The-Above (NOTA) relation (Gao et al., 2019). Note that, in our definition, the NOTA label differs from no-rel in the sense that a relation holds between the two entities, but its type is not in the considered RC label set. 6 What Do You Mean by Relation Extraction? RE studies rarely address the whole pipeline. We 5 Some studies divide the entity extraction into two substeps: identification (often called MD), and subsequent classification into entity types. 6 Some studies name such relation Other (Hendrickx et al., 2010). analyze all the ACL papers published in the last five years which contain the Relation Extraction keyword in the title and determine which sub-task is performed (NER/MD, RI, RC). Table 2 shows such investigation. We leave out from this analysis (a) papers which make use of distant supervision or which somehow involve knowledge bases, (b) shared task papers, (c) the bioNLP field, (d) temporal RE, and (e) Open RE. The result shows that gold entities are usually assumed for RE, presumably given the complexity of the NER/MD task on its own. Most importantly, for end-to-end models, recent work has shown that ablations for steps like NER are lacking (Taillé et al., 2020). Our analysis further shows that it is difficult to determine the RI setup. While RC is always performed, the situation is different for RI (or no-rel). Sometimes RI is clearly not done (i.e., the paper assumes a scenario in which every instance contains at least one relation), but most of the times it is either not clear from the paper, or done in a simplified scenario (e.g., datasets which already clear out most of the no-rel entity pair instances). As this blurriness hampers fair evaluation, we propose that studies clearly state which step they include, i.e., whether the work focus is on RC, RI+RC or the full RE pipeline and how special cases (no-rel and NOTA) are handled. These details are utterly important as they impact both model estimation and evaluation.', 'Pipeline or Joint Model? The traditional RE pipeline is, by definition of pipeline, prone to error propagation by sub-tasks. Joint entity and relation extraction approaches have been proposed in order to alleviate this problem (Miwa and Bansal, 2016;Zhang et al., 2017a;Bekoulis et al., 2018a,b;Wang and Lu, 2020;Wang et al., 2021). However, Taillé et al. (2020) recently discussed the challenge of properly evaluating such complex models.

While some recent work shifts to joint models, it is still an open question which approach (joint or pipeline) is the most robust. Zhong and Chen (2021) found that when incorporating modern pretrained language models (e.g., BERT) using separate encoders can surpass existing joint models.

For this reason and because of our final goal, which is a closer look to sub-domains in the scientific field, we follow the pipeline approach and, following most work from Table 2, we here restrict the setup by focusing on the RC task."

Predicting performance can be another indicator for querying.

Recently, methods have been proposed to learn another model to select instances that lead to the fewest errors, usually measured on a held-out development set.

1. How can active learning models predict their performance in NLP tasks?

Answer:

(p6.0) Predicting performance can be another indicator for querying. Ideally, the selected instances should be the ones that most reduce future errors if labeled and added to the training set. This motivates the expected error reduction strategy (Roy and McCallum, 2001), which chooses instances that lead to the least expected error if added to retrain a model. This strategy can be computationally costly since retraining is needed for each candidate.

(p6.1) Recently, methods have been proposed to learn another model to select instances that lead to the fewest errors, usually measured on a held-out development set. Reinforcement learning and imitation learning have been utilized to train such policy models (Bachman et al., 2017;Fang et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018a,b). This learning-to-select strategy may have some constraints. First, it requires labeled data (maybe from another domain) to train the policy. To mitigate this reliance, Vu et al. (2019) use the current task model as an imperfect annotator for AL simulations. Moreover, the learning signals may be unstable for complex tasks, as Koshorek et al. (2019) show for semantic tasks.

(p6.2) A similar and simpler idea is to select the most erroneous or ambiguous instances with regard to the current task model, which can also be done with another performance-prediction model. Yoo and Kweon (2019) directly train a smaller model to predict the instance losses for CV tasks, which have been also adopted for NLP (Cai et al., 2021;. In a similar spirit,  employ a neural model to judge the correctness of the model prediction for SRL and Brantley et al.

In the computer vision community, this is a popular approach where, e.g., rotating an image is invariant to the classification of an image's content. For text, on the token level, this can be done by replacing words with equivalents, such as synonyms (Wei and Zou, 2019), entities of the same type (Raiman and Miller, 2017;Dai and Adel, 2020) or words that share the same morphology (Gulordava et al., 2018;Vania et al., 2019). Such replacements can also be guided by a language model that takes context into consideration (Fadaee et al., 2017;Kobayashi, 2018)."", 'To go beyond the token level and add more diversity to the augmented sentences, data augmentation can also be performed on sentence parts. Operations that (depending on the task) do not change the label include manipulation of parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018;Vania et al., 2019;Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplification of sentences by removal of sentence parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018) and inversion of the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020). For whole sentences, paraphrasing through backtranslation can be used. This is a popular approach in machine translation where target sentences are back-translated into source sentences (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011;Hoang et al., 2018). An important aspect here is that errors in the source side/features do not seem to have a large negative effect on the generated target text the model needs to predict. It is therefore also used in other text generation tasks like abstract summarization (Parida and Motlicek, 2019) and table-to-text generation (Ma et al., 2019). Back-translation has also been leveraged for text classification (Xie et al., 2020;Hegde and Patil, 2020). This setting assumes, however, the availability of a translation system. Instead, a language model can also be used for augmenting text classification datasets (Kumar et al., 2020;Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020). It is trained conditioned on a label, i.e., on the subset of the task-specific data with this label. It then generates additional sentences that fit this label. Ding et al. (2020) extend this idea for token level tasks.', 'Adversarial methods are often used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020;Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020). They can, however, also be utilized to augment NLP datasets (Yasunaga et al., 2018;Morris et al., 2020). Instead of manually crafted transformation rules, these methods learn how to apply small perturbations to the input data that do not change the meaning of the text (according to a specific score). This approach is often applied on the level of vector representations. For instance, Grundkiewicz et al. (2019) reverse the augmentation setting by applying transformations that flip the (binary) label. In their case, they introduce errors in correct sentences to obtain new training data for a grammar correction task.', 'Open Issues: While data augmentation is ubiquitous in the computer vision community and while most of the above-presented approaches are taskindependent, it has not found such widespread use in natural language processing.

In the computer vision community, this is a popular approach where, e.g., rotating an image is invariant to the classification of an image's content. For text, on the token level, this can be done by replacing words with equivalents, such as synonyms (Wei and Zou, 2019), entities of the same type (Raiman and Miller, 2017;Dai and Adel, 2020) or words that share the same morphology (Gulordava et al., 2018;Vania et al., 2019).

To go beyond the token level and add more diversity to the augmented sentences, data augmentation can also be performed on sentence parts. Operations that (depending on the task) do not change the label include manipulation of parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018;Vania et al., 2019;Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplification of sentences by removal of sentence parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018) and inversion of the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020).

New instances can be obtained based on existing ones by modifying the features with transformations that do not change the label. In the computer vision community, this is a popular approach where, e.g., rotating an image is invariant to the classification of an image's content. For text, on the token level, this can be done by replacing words with equivalents, such as synonyms (Wei and Zou, 2019), entities of the same type (Raiman and Miller, 2017;Dai and Adel, 2020) or words that share the same morphology (Gulordava et al., 2018;Vania et al., 2019). Such replacements can also be guided by a language model that takes context into consideration (Fadaee et al., 2017;Kobayashi, 2018).##
To go beyond the token level and add more diversity to the augmented sentences, data augmentation can also be performed on sentence parts.

Adversarial methods are often used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020;Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020).

1. What strategies are employed for data augmentation in NLP to enhance model robustness?

Answer:

(p6.0) New instances can be obtained based on existing ones by modifying the features with transformations that do not change the label. In the computer vision community, this is a popular approach where, e.g., rotating an image is invariant to the classification of an image's content. For text, on the token level, this can be done by replacing words with equivalents, such as synonyms (Wei and Zou, 2019), entities of the same type (Raiman and Miller, 2017;Dai and Adel, 2020) or words that share the same morphology (Gulordava et al., 2018;Vania et al., 2019). Such replacements can also be guided by a language model that takes context into consideration (Fadaee et al., 2017;Kobayashi, 2018).

(p6.1) To go beyond the token level and add more diversity to the augmented sentences, data augmentation can also be performed on sentence parts. Operations that (depending on the task) do not change the label include manipulation of parts of the dependency tree (Şahin and Steedman, 2018;Vania et al., 2019;Dehouck and Gómez-Rodríguez, 2020), simplification of sentences by removal of sentence parts (Şahin and Steedman, 2018) and inversion of the subject-object relation (Min et al., 2020). For whole sentences, paraphrasing through backtranslation can be used. This is a popular approach in machine translation where target sentences are back-translated into source sentences (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011;Hoang et al., 2018). An important aspect here is that errors in the source side/features do not seem to have a large negative effect on the generated target text the model needs to predict. It is therefore also used in other text generation tasks like abstract summarization (Parida and Motlicek, 2019) and table-to-text generation (Ma et al., 2019). Back-translation has also been leveraged for text classification (Xie et al., 2020;Hegde and Patil, 2020). This setting assumes, however, the availability of a translation system. Instead, a language model can also be used for augmenting text classification datasets (Kumar et al., 2020;Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020). It is trained conditioned on a label, i.e., on the subset of the task-specific data with this label. It then generates additional sentences that fit this label. Ding et al. (2020) extend this idea for token level tasks.

(p6.2) Adversarial methods are often used to find weaknesses in machine learning models (Jin et al., 2020;Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020). They can, however, also be utilized to augment NLP datasets (Yasunaga et al., 2018;Morris et al., 2020). Instead of manually crafted transformation rules, these methods learn how to apply small perturbations to the input data that do not change the meaning of the text (according to a specific score). This approach is often applied on the level of vector representations. For instance, Grundkiewicz et al. (2019) reverse the augmentation setting by applying transformations that flip the (binary) label. In their case, they introduce errors in correct sentences to obtain new training data for a grammar correction task.

(p6.3) Open Issues: While data augmentation is ubiquitous in the computer vision community and while most of the above-presented approaches are taskindependent, it has not found such widespread use in natural language processing. A reason might be that several of the approaches require an indepth understanding of the language. There is not yet a unified framework that allows applying data augmentation across tasks and languages. Recently, Longpre et al. (2020) hypothesised that data augmentation provides the same benefits as pretraining in transformer models. However, we argue that data augmentation might be better suited to leverage the insights of linguistic or domain experts in low-resource settings when unlabeled data or hardware resources are limited."

For named entity recognition (NER), a list of location names might be obtained from a dictionary and matches of tokens in the text with entities in the list are automatically labeled as locations. Distant supervision was introduced by Mintz et al. (2009) for relation extraction (RE) with extensions on multi-instance (Riedel et al., 2010) and multi-label learning (Surdeanu et al., 2012). It is still a popular approach for information extraction tasks like NER and RE where the external information can be obtained from knowledge bases, gazetteers, dictionaries and other forms of structured knowledge sources (Luo et al., 2017;Hedderich and Klakow, 2018;Deng and Sun, 2019;Alt et al., 2019;Ye et al., 2019;Lange et al., 2019a;Nooralahzadeh et al., 2019;Le and Titov, 2019;Cao et al., 2019;Lison et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2021a). The automatic annotation ranges from simple string matching  to complex pipelines including classifiers and manual steps (Norman et al., 2019). This distant supervision using information from external knowledge sources can be seen as a subset of the more general approach of labeling rules. These encompass also other ideas like reg-ex rules or simple programming functions (Ratner et al., 2017;Zheng et al., 2019;Adelani et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2020;Lison et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020;Karamanolakis et al., 2021).",How does distant supervision enhance information extraction in low-resource NLP tasks?,1.

1. How does distant supervision enhance information extraction in low-resource NLP tasks?

Answer:

(p7.0) In contrast to data augmentation, distant or weak supervision uses unlabeled text and keeps it unmodified. The corresponding labels are obtained through a (semi-)automatic process from an external source of information. For named entity recognition (NER), a list of location names might be obtained from a dictionary and matches of tokens in the text with entities in the list are automatically labeled as locations.

These encompass also other ideas like reg-ex rules or simple programming functions (Ratner et al., 2017;Zheng et al., 2019;Adelani et al., 2020;Hedderich et al., 2020;Lison et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2020;Karamanolakis et al., 2021).

(p7.1) While distant supervision is popular for information extraction tasks like NER and RE, it is less prevalent in other areas of NLP. Nevertheless, distant supervision has also been successfully em-  (2020) build a discourse-structure dataset using guidance from sentiment annotations. For topic classification, heuristics can be used in combination with inputs from other classifiers like NER (Bach et al., 2019) or from entity lists (Hedderich et al., 2020). For some classification tasks, the labels can be rephrased with simple rules into sentences. A pretrained language model then judges the label sentence that most likely follows the unlabeled input (Opitz, 2019;). An unlabeled review, for instance, might be continued with ""It was great/bad"" for obtaining binary sentiment labels.

(p7.2) Open Issues: The popularity of distant supervision for NER and RE might be due to these tasks being particularly suited. There, auxiliary data like entity lists is readily available and distant supervision often achieves reasonable results with simple surface form rules. It is an open question whether a task needs to have specific properties to be suitable for this approach. The existing work on other tasks and the popularity in other fields like image classification (Xiao et al., 2015;Li et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2018;Mahajan et al., 2018; suggests, however, that distant supervision could be leveraged for more NLP tasks in the future.

(p7.3) Distant supervision methods heavily rely on auxiliary data. In a low-resource setting, it might be difficult to obtain not only labeled data but also such auxiliary data. Kann et al. (2020) find a large gap between the performance on high-resource and low-resource languages for POS tagging pointing to the lack of high-coverage and error-free dictionaries for the weak supervision in low-resource languages. This emphasizes the need for evaluating such methods in a realistic setting and avoiding to just simulate restricted access to labeled data in a high-resource language.

(p7.4) While distant supervision allows obtaining labeled data more quickly than manually annotating every instance of a dataset, it still requires human interaction to create automatic annotation techniques or to provide labeling rules. This time and effort could also be spent on annotating more gold label data, either naively or through an active learning scheme. Unfortunately, distant supervision papers rarely provide information on how long the creation took, making it difficult to compare these approaches. Taking the human expert into the focus connects this research direction with humancomputer-interaction and human-in-the-loop setups (Klie et al., 2018;Qian et al., 2020).","A Survey on Recent Approaches for Natural Language Processing in Low-Resource Scenarios##

Robustness, despite its specific definitions in various lines of research, can typically be unified as follows: denote the input as x, and its associated gold label for the main task as y, assume a model f is trained on (x, y) ∼ D and its prediction over x as f (x); now given test data (x , y ) ∼ D = D, we can measure a model's robustness by its performance on D , e.g., using the model's robust accuracy (Tsipras et al., 2019;, defined as E (x ,y )∼D [f (x ) = y ]. Existing literature on robustness in NLP can be roughly categorized by how D is constructed: by synthetically perturbing the input (Section 2.1), or D is naturally occurring with a distribution shift (Section 2.2).##

1. How is robustness defined and measured in NLP models?

Answer:

(p1.0) Robustness, despite its specific definitions in various lines of research, can typically be unified as follows: denote the input as x, and its associated gold label for the main task as y, assume a model f is trained on (x, y) ∼ D and its prediction over x as f (x); now given test data (x , y ) ∼ D = D, we can measure a model's robustness by its performance on D , e.g., using the model's robust accuracy (Tsipras et al., 2019;, defined as E (x ,y )∼D [f (x ) = y ]. Existing literature on robustness in NLP can be roughly categorized by how D is constructed: by synthetically perturbing the input (Section 2.1), or D is naturally occurring with a distribution shift (Section 2.2).

(p1.1) The above definition works for a range of NLP tasks like text classification and sequence labeling where y is defined over a fixed set of discrete labels. For tasks like text generation, robustness is less well defined and can manifest as positional bias (Jung et al., 2019;Kryscinski et al., 2019), or hallucination (Maynez et al., 2020;Parikh et al., 2020;. One major challenge here is a lack of robust metrics in evaluating the quality of the generated text (Sellam et al., 2020;, i.e., we need a reliable metric to determine the relationship between f (x ) and y when both are open-ended texts."

This topic has been widely explored in computer vision under the concept of adversarial robustness, which measures models' performances against carefully crafted noises generated deliberately to deceive the model to predict wrongly, pioneered by (Szegedy et al., 2013;Goodfellow et al., 2015), and later extended to NLP, such as (Ebrahimi et al., 2018;Alzantot et al., 2018;Li et al., 2019;Feng et al., 2018;Kuleshov et al., 2018;Jia et al., 2019;Zang et al., 2020;Pruthi et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019e;Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020;Tan et al., 2020a,b;Schwinn et al., 2021;Li et al., 2021;Boucher et al., 2022) and multilingual adversaries . The generation of adversarial examples primarily builds upon the observation that we can generate samples that are meaningful to humans (e.g., by perturbing the samples with changes that are imperceptible to humans) while altering the prediction of the models for this sample. In this regard, human's remarkable ability in understanding a large set of synonyms (Li et al., 2020) or interesting characteristics in ignoring the exact order of letters  are often opportunities to create adversarial examples. A related line of work such as data-poisoning (Wallace et al., 2021) and weight-poisoning (Kurita et al., 2020) exposes NLP models' vulnerability against attacks during the training process. One can refer to more comprehensive reviews and broader discussions on this topic in Zhang et al. (2020c) and Morris et al. (2020b). Assumptions around Label-preserving and Semantic-preserving Most existing work in vision makes a relatively simplified assumption that the gold label of x remains unchanged under a bounded perturbation over x, i.e., y = y, and a model's robust behaviour should be f (x ) = y (Szegedy et al., 2013;Goodfellow et al., 2015). A similar line of work in NLP follows the same label-preserving assumption with small text perturbations like token and character swapping (Alzantot et al., 2018;Jin et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2019;Ebrahimi et al., 2018), paraphrasing (Iyyer et al., 2018;Gan and Ng, 2019), semantically equivalent adversarial rules (Ribeiro et al., 2018), and adding distractors (Jia and Liang, 2017). However, this label-preserving assumption might not always hold, e.g., Wang et al. (2021b) studied several existing text perturbation techniques and found that a significant portion of perturbed examples are not label-preserving (despite their label-preserving assumptions), or the resulting labels have a high disagreement among human raters (i.e., can even fool humans). Morris et al. (2020a) also call for more attention to the validity of perturbed examples for a more accurate robustness evaluation.

(p2.1) Another line of work aims to perturb the input x to x in small but meaningful ways that explicitly change the gold label, i.e., y = y, under which case the robust behaviour of a model should be f (x ) = y and f (x ) = y (Gardner et al., 2020;Kaushik et al., 2019;Schlegel et al., 2021). We believe these two lines of work are complementary to each other, and both should be explored in future research to measure models' robustness more comprehensively.

(p2.2) One alternative notion is whether the perturbation from x to x is ""semantic-preseving"" (Alzantot et al., 2018;Jin et al., 2020;Ren et al., 2019) or ""semantic-modifying"" (Shi and Huang, 2020;Jia and Liang, 2017). Note this is slightly different from the above label-preserving assumptions, as it is defined over the perturbations on (x, x ) rather than making an assumption on (y, y ), e.g., semantic-modifying perturbations can be either label-preserving (Jia and Liang, 2017;Huang, 2020) or label-changing (Gardner et al., 2020;Kaushik et al., 2019).","Measure and Improve Robustness in NLP Models: A Survey##

One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance. Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead. In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help. Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful. All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance. In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general. This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.', ""Mohtarami et al.

In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree. The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings. For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT. Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets. Alhindi et al.

To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted. The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021).

Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information. Atanasova et al. (2022) introduced the task of evidence sufficiency prediction to more reliably predict the NOT ENOUGH INFO class.', 'Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021). Such models do not require a retrieval step, as they use the knowledge stored in language models. However, they are prone to biases in the patterns used, e.g., they can predict date instead of city/country and vice-versa when using ""born in/on"". Moreover, the insufficient context can seriously confuse them, e.g., for short claims with uncommon words such as ""Sarawak is a ..."", where it is hard to detect the entity type. Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).', 'Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer."" vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club."", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers."" (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm."" is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.', 'Threaded Stance In the setting of conversational threads (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), in contrast to the single-task setup, which ignores or does not provide further context, important knowledge can be gained from the structure of user interactions.', ""These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours). A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017). Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets. More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020). Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1). Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph. Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection. Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task. Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification . Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019)."", 'A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0. Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1. Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class. On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).', 'Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.', 'Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness. However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.', 'Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance. Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models. They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets. Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.  They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios. Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance. Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1. The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc. Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets.']","In this section, we discuss various ways to use stance detection for mis-and disinformation detection, and list the state-of-the-art results in Table 2.

(NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm."" is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.

Threaded Stance In the setting of conversational threads (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), in contrast to the single-task setup, which ignores or does not provide further context, important knowledge can be gained from the structure of user interactions.

These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours). A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017). Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets. More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020). Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1). Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph. Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection. Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task. Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification . Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019).

A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0. Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1. Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class. On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).

Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.

Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness. However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.

Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance. Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models. They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets. Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.  They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios. Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance. Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1. The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc. Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets.","(p6.0) In this section, we discuss various ways to use stance detection for mis-and disinformation detection, and list the state-of-the-art results in Table 2.

(p6.1) Fact-Checking as Stance Detection Here, we discuss approaches for stance detection in the context of mis-and disinformation detection, where veracity is modelled as stance detection as outlined in Section 3.1. One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance. Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead. In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help. Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful. All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance. In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general. This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.

(p6.2) Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents. Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t. the target claim.

(p6.3) More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.

(p6.4) Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help. In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree. The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings. For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT. Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets. Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).

(p6.5) Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER . To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted. The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021). Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score. Yet, the retrieval model is also important, e.g., using the gold evidence set adds 1.4 points. Liu et al. (2020b); Zhong et al. (2020) replaced the retrieval model with a BERT-based one, in addition to using an improved mechanism to propagate the information between nodes in the graph, boosting the score to 70. Recently, Ye et al. (2020) experimented with a retriever that incorporates co-reference in distantsupervised pre-training, namely, CorefRoBERTa.  added external knowledge to build a contextualized semantic graph, setting a new SOTA on Snopes. Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information. Atanasova et al. (2022) introduced the task of evidence sufficiency prediction to more reliably predict the NOT ENOUGH INFO class.

(p6.6) Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021). Such models do not require a retrieval step, as they use the knowledge stored in language models. However, they are prone to biases in the patterns used, e.g., they can predict date instead of city/country and vice-versa when using ""born in/on"". Moreover, the insufficient context can seriously confuse them, e.g., for short claims with uncommon words such as ""Sarawak is a ..."", where it is hard to detect the entity type. Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).

(p6.7) Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer."" vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club."", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers."" (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm."" is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.

In this section, we discuss various ways to use stance detection for mis-and disinformation detection, and list the state-of-the-art results in Table 2.

Fact-Checking as Stance Detection Here, we discuss approaches for stance detection in the context of mis-and disinformation detection, where veracity is modelled as stance detection as outlined in Section 3.1. One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance. Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead. In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help. Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful. All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance. In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general. This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.

Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents. Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t. the target claim.

More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help. In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree. The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings. For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT. Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets. Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).

Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER . To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted. The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021). Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score. Yet, the retrieval model is also important, e.g., using the gold evidence set adds 1.4 points. Liu et al. (2020b); Zhong et al. (2020) replaced the retrieval model with a BERT-based one, in addition to using an improved mechanism to propagate the information between nodes in the graph, boosting the score to 70. Recently, Ye et al. (2020) experimented with a retriever that incorporates co-reference in distantsupervised pre-training, namely, CorefRoBERTa.  added external knowledge to build a contextualized semantic graph, setting a new SOTA on Snopes. Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information. Atanasova et al. (2022) introduced the task of evidence sufficiency prediction to more reliably predict the NOT ENOUGH INFO class.

Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021). Such models do not require a retrieval step, as they use the knowledge stored in language models. However, they are prone to biases in the patterns used, e.g., they can predict date instead of city/country and vice-versa when using ""born in/on"". Moreover, the insufficient context can seriously confuse them, e.g., for short claims with uncommon words such as ""Sarawak is a ..."", where it is hard to detect the entity type. Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).

Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer."" vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club."", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers."" (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm."" is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.

Threaded Stance In the setting of conversational threads (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), in contrast to the single-task setup, which ignores or does not provide further context, important knowledge can be gained from the structure of user interactions.

These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours). A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017). Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets. More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020). Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1). Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph. Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection. Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task. Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification . Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019).

A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0. Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1. Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class. On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).

Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.

Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness. However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.

Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance. Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models. They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets. Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.  They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios. Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance. Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1. The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc. Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets.",How does stance detection contribute to mis-and disinformation detection?,1.

(p6.9) These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours). A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017). Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets. More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020). Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1). Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph. Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection. Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task. Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification . Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019).

(p6.10) A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0. Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1. Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class. On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).

(p6.11) Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.

(p6.12) Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness. However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.

(p6.13) Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance. Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models. They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets. Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.  They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios. Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance. Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1. The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc. Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets.","A Survey on Stance Detection for Mis-and Disinformation Identification##

In this section, we discuss various ways to use stance detection for mis-and disinformation detection, and list the state-of-the-art results in Table 2.

Fact-Checking as Stance Detection Here, we discuss approaches for stance detection in the context of mis-and disinformation detection, where veracity is modelled as stance detection as outlined in Section 3.1.

Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents.

More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help.

Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER .

Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021).

Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer.""

Threaded Stance In the setting of conversational threads (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), in contrast to the single-task setup, which ignores or does not provide further context, important knowledge can be gained from the structure of user interactions.

1. What are the recent advancements in stance detection for combating mis-and disinformation?

Answer:

(p6.0) In this section, we discuss various ways to use stance detection for mis-and disinformation detection, and list the state-of-the-art results in Table 2.

(p6.1) Fact-Checking as Stance Detection Here, we discuss approaches for stance detection in the context of mis-and disinformation detection, where veracity is modelled as stance detection as outlined in Section 3.1. One such line of research is the Fake News Challenge, which used weighted accuracy as an evaluation measure (FNC score), to mitigate the impact of class imbalance. Subsequently, Hanselowski et al. (2018a) criticized the FNC score and F1-micro, and argued in favour of F1-macro (F1) instead. In the competition, most teams used hand-crafted features such as words, word embeddings, and sentiment lexica (Riedel et al., 2017;Hanselowski et al., 2018a). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that the most important group of features were the lexical ones, followed by features from topic models, while sentiment analysis did not help. Ghanem et al. (2018) investigated the importance of lexical cues, and found that report and negation are most beneficial, while knowledge and denial are least useful. All these models struggle to learn the Disagree class, achieving up to 18 F1 due to major class imbalance. In contrast, Unrelated is detected almost perfectly by all models (over 99 F1). Hanselowski et al. (2018a) showed that these models exploit the lexical overlap between the headline and the document, but fail when there is a need to model semantic relations or complex negation, or to understand propositional content in general. This can be attributed to the use of n-grams, topic models, and lexica.

(p6.2) Mohtarami et al. (2018) investigated memory networks, aiming to mitigate the impact of irrelevant and noisy information by learning a similarity matrix and a stance filtering component, and taking a step towards explaining the stance of a given claim by extracting meaningful snippets from evidence documents. Like previous work, their model performs poorly on the Agree/Disagree classes, due to the unsupervised way of training the memory networks, i.e., there are no gold snippets justifying the document's stance w.r.t. the target claim.

(p6.3) More recently, transfer learning with pre-trained Transformers has been explored (Slovikovskaya and Attardi, 2020), significantly improving the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.

(p6.4) Guderlei and Aßenmacher (2020) showed the most important hyper-parameter to be learning rate, while freezing layers did not help. In particular, using the pre-trained Transformer RoBERTa improved F1 from 18 to 58 for Disagree, and from 50 to 70 for Agree. The success of these models is also seen in cross-lingual settings. For Arabic, Khouja (2020) achieved 76.7 F1 for stance detection on the ANS dataset using mBERT. Similarly, Hardalov et al. (2022) applied pattern-exploiting training (PET) with sentiment pre-training in a cross-lingual setting showing sizeable improvements on 15 datasets. Alhindi et al. (2021) showed that language-specific pre-training was pivotal, outperforming the state of the art on AraStance (52 F1) and Arabic FC (78 F1).

(p6.5) Some formulations include an extra step for evidence retrieval, e.g., retrieving Wikipedia snippets for FEVER . To evaluate the whole fact-checking pipeline, they introduced the FEVER score -the proportion of claims for which both correct evidence is returned and a correct label is predicted. The top systems that participated in the FEVER competition Hanselowski et al. More recent approaches used bi-directional attention (Li et al., 2018), a GPT language model (Malon, 2018;, and graph neural networks (Zhou et al., 2019;Atanasov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020b;Zhong et al., 2020;Weinzierl et al., 2021;Si et al., 2021). Zhou et al. (2019) showed that adding graph networks on top of BERT can improve performance, reaching 67.1 FEVER score. Yet, the retrieval model is also important, e.g., using the gold evidence set adds 1.4 points. Liu et al. (2020b); Zhong et al. (2020) replaced the retrieval model with a BERT-based one, in addition to using an improved mechanism to propagate the information between nodes in the graph, boosting the score to 70. Recently, Ye et al. (2020) experimented with a retriever that incorporates co-reference in distantsupervised pre-training, namely, CorefRoBERTa.  added external knowledge to build a contextualized semantic graph, setting a new SOTA on Snopes. Si et al. (2021) and Ostrowski et al. (2021) improved multi-hop reasoning using a model with eXtra Hop attention (Zhao et al., 2020), a capsule network aggregation layer, and LDA topic information. Atanasova et al. (2022) introduced the task of evidence sufficiency prediction to more reliably predict the NOT ENOUGH INFO class.

(p6.6) Another notable idea is to use pre-trained language models as fact-checkers based on a masked language modelling objective (Lee et al., 2020), or to use the perplexity of the entire claim with respect to the target document (Lee et al., 2021). Such models do not require a retrieval step, as they use the knowledge stored in language models. However, they are prone to biases in the patterns used, e.g., they can predict date instead of city/country and vice-versa when using ""born in/on"". Moreover, the insufficient context can seriously confuse them, e.g., for short claims with uncommon words such as ""Sarawak is a ..."", where it is hard to detect the entity type. Finally, the performance of such models remains well below supervised approaches; even though recent work shows that few-shot training can improve results (Lee et al., 2021).

(p6.7) Error analysis suggests that the main challenges are (i) confusing semantics at the sentence level, e.g., ""Andrea Pirlo is an American professional footballer."" vs. ""Andrea Pirlo is an Italian professional footballer who plays for an American club."", (ii) sensitivity to spelling errors, (iii) lack of relation between the article and the entities in the claim, (vi) dependence on syntactic overlaps, e.g., ""Terry Crews played on the Los Angeles Chargers."" (NotE-noughInfo) is classified as refuted, given the sentence ""In football, Crews played ... for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and Washington Redskins, ..."", (v) embedding-level confusion, e.g., numbers tend to have similar embeddings, ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 bpm."" is not classified as refuted based on the evidence sentence ""The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 bpm."", and similarly for months.

(p6.9) These approaches are mostly applied as part of a larger system, e.g., for detecting and debunking rumours (see Section 3.2, Rumours). A common pattern is to use tree-like structured models, fed with lexicon-based content formatting (Zubiaga et al., 2016a) or dictionary-based token scores (Aker et al., 2017). Kumar and Carley (2019) replaced CRFs with Binarised Constituency Tree LSTMs, and used pre-trained embeddings to encode the tweets. More recently, Tree (Ma and Gao, 2020) and Hierarchical (Yu et al., 2020) Transformers were proposed, which combine post-and threadlevel representations for rumour debunking, improving previous results on RumourEval '17 (Yu et al., 2020). Kochkina et al. (2017Kochkina et al. ( , 2018 split conversations into branches, modelling each branch with branched-LSTM and hand-crafted features, outperforming other systems at RumourEval '17 on stance detection (43.4 F1). Li et al. (2020) deviated from this structure and modelled the conversations as a graph. Tian et al. (2020) showed that pre-training on stance data yielded better representations for threaded tweets for downstream rumour detection. Yang et al. (2019) took a step further and curated per-class pre-training data by adapting examples, not only from stance datasets, but also from tasks such as question answering, achieving the highest F1 (57.9) on the RumourEval '19 stance detection task. Li et al. (2019a,b) additionally incorporated user credibility information, conversation structure, and other content-related features to predict the rumour veracity, ranking 3rd on stance detection and 1st on veracity classification . Finally, the stance of a post might not be expressed directly towards the root of the thread, thus the preceding posts must be also taken into account (Gorrell et al., 2019).

(p6.10) A major challenge for all rumour detection datasets is the class distribution (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Gorrell et al., 2019), e.g., the minority class denying is extremely hard for models to learn, as even for strong systems such as Kochkina et al. (2017) the F1 for it is 0. Label semantics also appears to play a role as the querying label has a similar distribution, but much higher F1. Yet another factor is thread depth, as performance drops significant at higher depth, especially for the supporting class. On the positive side, using multitask learning and incorporating stance detection labels into veracity detection yields a huge boost in performance (Gorrell et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020).

(p6.11) Another factor, which goes hand in hand with the threaded structure, is the temporal dimension of posts in a thread (Lukasik et al., 2016;Veyseh et al., 2017;Dungs et al., 2018;. In-depth data analysis (Zubiaga et al. (2016a,b); Kochkina et al. (2017); ; Ma and Gao (2020); Li et al. (2020); among others) shows interesting patterns along the temporal dimension: (i) source tweets (at zero depth) usually support the rumour and models often learn to detect that, (ii) it takes time for denying tweets to emerge, afterwards for false rumors their number increases quite substantially, (iii) the proportion of querying tweets towards unverified rumors also shows an upward trend over time, but their overall number decreases.

(p6.12) Multi-Dataset Learning (MDL) Mixing data from different domains and sources can improve robustness. However, setups that combine mis-and disinformation identification with stance detection, outlined in Section 3, vary in their annotation and labelling schemes, which poses many challenges.

(p6.13) Earlier approaches focused on pre-training models on multiple tasks, e.g., Fang et al. (2019) achieved state-of-the-art results on FNC-1 by finetuning on multiple tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, etc., which are weakly related to stance. Recently, Schiller et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of stance detection models. They leveraged a pre-trained multi-task deep neural network, MT-DNN (Liu et al., 2019), and continued its training on all datasets simultaneously using multitask learning, showing sizeable improvements over models trained on individual datasets. Hardalov et al. (2021) (Schick and Schütze, 2021) in a cross-lingual setting, combining datasets with different label inventories by modelling the task as a cloze question answering one.  They showed that MDL helps for low-resource and substantively for full-resource scenarios. Moreover, transferring knowledge from English stance datasets and noisily generated sentiment-based stance data can further boost performance. Table 2 shows the state-of-theart (SOTA) results for each dataset discussed in Section 3 and Table 1. The datasets vary in their task formulation and composition in terms of size, number of classes, class imbalance, topics, evaluation measures, etc. Each of these factors impacts the performance, leading to sizable differences in the final score, as discussed in Section 4, and hence rendering the reported results hard to compare directly across these datasets."

Dataset Size A major limitation holding back the performance of machine learning for stance detection is the size of the existing stance datasets, the vast majority of which contain at most a few thousand examples. Contrasted with the related task of Natural Language Inference, where datasets such as SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) of more than half a million samples have been collected, this is far from optimal. Moreover, the small dataset sizes are often accompanied with skewed class distribution with very few examples from the minority classes, including many of the datasets in this study (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Pomerleau and Rao, 2017;Baly et al., 2018b;Gorrell et al., 2019;Lillie et al., 2019;Alhindi et al., 2021).

This can lead to a significant disparity for label performance (see Section 4). Several techniques have been proposed to mitigate this, such as sampling strategies (Nie et al., 2019), weighting classes (Veyseh et al., 2017), 3 crafting artificial examples from auxiliary tasks Hardalov et al., 2022), or training on multiple datasets (Schiller et al., 2021;Hardalov et al., 2021Hardalov et al., , 2022.

Data Mixing A potential way of overcoming limitations in terms of dataset size and focus is to combine multiple datasets. Yet, as we previously discussed (see Section 3), task definitions and label inventories vary across stance datasets. Further, large-scale studies of approaches that leverage the relationships between label inventories, or the similarity between datasets are still largely lacking. One promising direction is the use of label embeddings (Augenstein et al., 2018), as they offer a convenient way to learn interactions between disjoint label sets that carry semantic relations. One such first study was recently presented by Hardalov et al. (2021), which explored different strategies for leveraging inter-dataset signals and label interactions in both in-(seen targets) and out-of-domain (unseen targets) settings. This could help to overcome challenges faced by models trained on smallsize datasets, and even for smaller minority classes.

Multilinguality Multi-linguality is important for several reasons: (i) the content may originate in various languages, (ii) the evidence or the stance may not be expressed in the same language, thus (iii) posing a challenge for fact-checkers, who might not be speakers of the language the claim was originally made in, and (iv) it adds more data that can be leveraged for modelling stance. Currently, only a handful of datasets for factuality and stance cover languages other than English (see Table 1), and they are small in size and do not offer a cross-lingual setup. Recently, Vamvas and Sennrich (2020) proposed such a setup for three languages for stance in debates, Schick andSchütze (2021) explored few-shot learning, andHardalov et al. (2022) extended that paradigm with sentiment and stance pre-training and evaluated on twelve languages from various domains. Since cultural norms and expressed linguistic phenomena play a crucial role in understanding the context of a claim (Sap et al., 2019), we do not argue for a completely language-agnostic framework. Yet, empirically, training in cross-lingual setups improves performance by leveraging better representations learned on a similar language or by acting as a regulariser.

Modelling the Context Modelling the context is a particularly important, yet challenging task. In many cases, there is a need to consider the background of the stance-taker as well as the characteristics of the targeted object. In particular, in the context of social media, one can provide information about the users such as their previous activity, other users they interact most with, the threads they participate in, or even their interests (Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Gorrell et al., 2019;Li et al., 2019b). The context of the stance expressed in news articles is related to the features of the media outlets, such as source of funding, previously known biases, or credibility (Baly et al., 2019;Darwish et al., 2020;Stefanov et al., 2020;Baly et al., 2020). When using contextual information about the object, factual information about the real world, and the time of posting are all important. Incorporating these into a stance detection pipeline, while challenging, paves the way towards a robust detection process.

Multimodal Content Spreading mis-and disinformation through multiple modalities is becoming increasingly popular. One such example are deepfakes, i.e., synthetically created images or videos, in which (usually) the face of one person is replaced with another person's face. Another example are information propagation techniques such as memetic warfare. Hence, it is increasingly important to combine different modalities to understand the full context stance is being expressed in. Some work in this area is on fake news detection for images (Nakamura et al., 2020), claim verification for images (Zlatkova et al., 2019), or searching for fact-checked information to alleviate the spread of fake news (Vo and Lee, 2020). There has been work on meme analysis for related tasks: detecting hateful (Kiela et al., 2020), harmful (Pramanick et al., 2021;Sharma et al., 2022a), and propagandistic memes (Dimitrov et al., 2021a,b); see also a recent survey of harmful memes (Sharma et al., 2022b). This line of research is especially relevant for mis-and disinformation tasks that depend on the wisdom of the crowd in social media as it adds additional information sources (Qazvinian et al., 2011;Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Hossain et al., 2020); see Section 5.",What are the key challenges and future directions in machine learning for stance detection?,1.

Some work in this area is on fake news detection for images (Nakamura et al., 2020), claim verification for images (Zlatkova et al., 2019), or searching for fact-checked information to alleviate the spread of fake news (Vo and Lee, 2020). There has been work on meme analysis for related tasks: detecting hateful (Kiela et al., 2020), harmful (Pramanick et al., 2021;Sharma et al., 2022a), and propagandistic memes (Dimitrov et al., 2021a,b); see also a recent survey of harmful memes (Sharma et al., 2022b). This line of research is especially relevant for mis-and disinformation tasks that depend on the wisdom of the crowd in social media as it adds additional information sources (Qazvinian et al., 2011;Zubiaga et al., 2016b;Derczynski et al., 2017;Hossain et al., 2020); see Section 5."
