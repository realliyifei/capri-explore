Abstract Supplement442021Conclusion: Self-isolation due to COVID-19 was not associated with changes in depression, sleepiness, and insomnia among patients for sleep outpatient units in in Shiga prefecture, Japan. Support (if any): The present study was supported by MEXT/JSPS (KAKENHI Grant Number: 17H00872). 658
Results:  3.65±0.62 and 3.52±0.66: p=0.410), AIS  (4.78±0.59, 4.65±0.57 and 4.63±0.57: p=0.843) and ESS (7.93±0.76, 7.07±0.68 and 7.00±0.73: p=0.088) were not significantly different among three visits. Sleep duration (6.06±0.23hr, 6.29±0.19hr and 6.16±0.22hr: p=0.248) and sleep onset latency (24.8±5.55min, 19.2±3.97min and 21.0±4.85min: p=0.445) were also not significantly different.

## Introduction:## Introduction:

Telehealth is a relatively new tool for patient care, and to reach underserved areas where certain specialties are available. With the advent of the COVID19 pandemic, Telehealth has become a universal way to provide safe and quality patient care. However, Telehealth is a new experience for many providers and patients. We surveyed patients who received telehealth visits in sleep medicine between March and June 2020 to determine patient satisfaction and common technology-related barriers. The goal was to formulate actionable steps for improving patient's experiences and determine the feasibility of long-term telehealth services for sleep medicine. Methods: We interviewed 63 patients by phone, utilizing IRB approved surveys for telehealth satisfaction and technology. Responses were de-identified, tabulated, and analyzed in aggregate using Excel®. Results: 85% of respondents had a high-school diploma or a higher level of education (9.6% students, 39.7% employed, 15.9% unemployed, and 19% retirees). 62% of participants participated in Telehealth for the first time. 89% preferred Telehealth, and 76% rated telehealth experience as good or better than in-person visits. 92% did not require technical assistance during the visit. Long-term telehealth care was acceptable to 63% of participants. Approximately 33% had technology-related barriers (no computer or webcam), and 12% did not have email. However, 89% had smartphones (70% connected to personal internet). Other barriers cited were lack of private space (13%) and taking time off work (9%). No clear preference for phone versus video Telehealth was noted (approximately 40% each), but 7% expressed concern about bi-directional video communication. This may be related to the privacy and security concerns expressed by 20% of respondents. However, only 5% reported using the electronic health record (EHR) based secure communication portal. Conclusion: Sleep care via Telehealth is preferred by most patients during the COVID pandemic and is acceptable to two-thirds of patients for the long-term. In addition to access to personal devices or the internet, privacy concerns were a barrier to Telehealth. We plan to increase patient enrollment in the EHR-based portal to deliver telehealth services and communication securely to mitigate these barriers. Support ( Introduction: Sleep problems remain problematically prevalent among U.S. service members. In 2015 over 60% of sampled service members reported getting less than 7 hours of sleep per night, 31.4% getting 5 hours or less, and nearly 50% reported subthreshold insomnia symptoms on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Ongoing COVID-19 service delivery restrictions necessitate a rapid shift to virtual health solutions and illuminate barriers to the delivery of sleep interventions. This process improvement pilot was a proof-of-concept during uncertain times. Methods: From September to January 2020, 10 weekly 1-time, 60-min virtual sleep classes were held over Microsoft Teams. Interventions were consistent with Motivational Interviewing and Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia. Participants completed the STOP BANG and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) before each class, and accomplished the ISI again at a 2-week contact during which they rated progress toward problem resolution and were offered additional clinical services as-needed. Results: Forty-six participants attended the class. 67% responded to the post-class survey. 74% responded to the two-week follow-up. A majority (84%) indicated either agreement or strong agreement with the statement 'I plan to CHANGE a behavior or TRY an intervention I learned to better my sleep', and many proceeded to establish a more consistent sleep schedule (n=14; 45%), remove electronics from the bedroom (n=13; 42%), and/or go to bed only when sleepy (n=11; 35%). 84% would recommend this class to others with similar concerns. Scaled from 1 ('no change') to 10 ('full resolution'), participants reported having derived modest benefit from the intervention (M = 4.1, SD=1.7). Eleven (35%) denied need for additional sleep-related services, and 84% expressed intent to recommend the class to others with similar concerns. Conclusion: Results suggest a military population is receptive to a 1-time, virtual sleep class consistent with social distancing strictures. This service provided patients rapid access to care while contemporaneously reducing demand for time-intensive one-to-one appointments. As hypothesized, receipt of the intervention was associated with intention to modify sleep-relevant behavior, and with meaningful progress toward resolution of sleep difficulty as assessed at 2-week follow-up. Broadly disseminated, this intervention could introduce an internetbased, stepped-care approach to management of sleep insufficiency across the DoD. Introduction: The COVID19 pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge for healthcare delivery. Optimization of resources and safety of patients and healthcare workers is crucial. The aim of this study is to analyze impact on resource utilization at VA Maryland Healthcare System (VAMHCS). At the pandemic onset, we deployed a mail-in
