We present the results of the first complete unbaised survey of the Galactic Plane for 6035-MHz excited-state hydroxyl masers undertaken as part of the Methanol Multibeam Survey. These observations cover the Galactic longitude ranges 186 • < l < 60 • including the Galactic Centre. We report the detection of 127 excited-state hydroxyl masers within the survey region, 47 being new sources. The positions of new detections were determined from interferometric observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We discuss the association of 6035-MHz masers in our survey with the 6668-MHz masers from the MMB Survey, finding 37 likely CH 3 OH−ex-OH maser pairs with physical separations of 0.03pc and 55 pairings separated by 0.1pc. Using these we calculate for the first time an excited-state hydroxyl maser life time of between 3.3×10 3 and 8.3×10 3 years. We also discuss the variability of the 6035-MHz masers and detection rates of counterpart 6030-MHz excited-state hydroxyl masers (28% of our sample having detection at both frequencies).

# INTRODUCTION

The Methanol Multibeam (MMB) survey is an unbiased Galactic plane survey searching for the 6668-MHz methanol maser line (Green et al. 2009). The MMB survey region covers the whole southern portion of the Galactic plane (longitudes 186 • < l < 60 • , latitude |b| 2 • ).

The 6668-MHz methanol maser transition is uniquely associated with high-mass star formation (Minier et al. 2003;Xu et al. 2008;Breen et al. 2013) making it a clear signpost of regions of high-mass star formation and their distribution throughout the Milky Way. Ground-state and excited-state hydroxyl (hereafter ex-OH) maser transitions are often associated with the 6668-MHz methanol maser (e.g. Caswell 1997Caswell , 1998. First observed in the late 1960s and early 1970s (e.g Yen et al. 1969;Rydbeck et al. 1970) the 2 Π 3/2 J = 5/2, F = 3 − 3 ex-OH maser transition at 6035-MHz and the nearby, often weaker, 6030-MHz maser line ( 2 Π 3/2 J = 5/2, F = 2 − 2) have been extensively studied with multiple targeted surveys, usually toward other maser species (e.g. 6668-MHz CH3OH or ground-state OH, see Knowles et al. 1976;Caswell & Vaile 1995;Baudry et al. 1997;Caswell 1997Caswell , 2001. The ex-OH maser transitions are primarily observed toward star forming regions, with only two known examples observed toward evolved stars (Vy 2-2 and K 3-35, see Desmurs et al. 2010) making ex-OH masers in evolved stars extremely rare and a potentially transient phenomenon (Richards 2012). These sources are not present in this current work as both exist at Galactic latitudes outside of the MMB survey range.

When observed in association with the 6668-MHz c XXXX The Authors 2 A.Avison et al. CH3OH maser, the rarer ex-OH maser gives important additional information on the environment of the star forming region it inhabits. This maser transition appears to exist in pre-ionising high-mass protostellar objects as well as sources with ultra compact Hii regions (Fish 2007, and references therein).

Ex-OH masers are predominantly radiatively pumped requiring a nearby source of infrared emission at wavelengths of the order ∼30-120µm to generate the population inversion, (e.g Cesaroni & Walmsley 1991;Gray et al. 1992;Gray 2001). Figure 1 shows rotational energy level diagram for both ground state and ex-OH transitions. Models of maser pumping by Cragg et al. (2002) find that both the 6030 and 6035-MHz transitions occur in zones of low gas temperatures (T k < 70K) and high densities (up to nH = 10 8.5 cm −3 ), covering a parameter space coincident with, but not identical to, both the 6668-MHz CH3OH and ground-state OH (1612( , 1665( , 1667( , 1720 masers (see also Gray et al. 1992). As such, coincident detection of multiple maser species can place constraints on the environment of a high-mass star forming region (e.g. Cragg et al. 2001;Sutton et al. 2001, for methanol). The ex-OH maser also provides important information about the magnetic fields in its local environment as OH has a relatively large Lande g-factor resulting in a significant Zeeman splitting of the maser lines (Fish 2007, and references therein).

In this paper we present the results from a survey for the 6035-MHz line of ex-OH carried out in parallel with the MMB survey. We present high signal-to-noise spectra at both 6035-MHz and 6030-MHz (the latter from targeted follow-up observations) for all sources and accurate interferometric positions for the newly detected masers, as well as discussing ex-OH maser source variability and association with 6668-MHz CH3OH maser counterparts. In a companion paper we will explore the results of the survey in relation to the magnetic fields probed by the masers (Avison et al. in prep).


# METHANOL MULTIBEAM SURVEY PARAMETERS AND EQUIPMENT

The full details of the techniques used by the MMB survey are presented in Green et al. (2009), therefore here we present only a summary of those points relevant to the ex-OH observations. The MMB survey was conducted as a blind survey using a custom built seven-beam receiver on the Parkes Radio Telescope. Using the receiver's 1-GHz bandwidth both the 6668-MHz CH3OH line and the 6035-MHz ex-OH lines were surveyed simultaneously, to a typical RMS noise level of 0.17Jy (Green et al. 2009). The Parkes data included both Left-hand (LHCP) and Right-hand (RHCP) circular polarisation data. Any new ex-OH detections or sources without previous high-resolution positions were then followed up with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to acquire a position (to within ∼ 0.4 ′′ ). Finally, to obtain high signalto-noise spectra of these sources, they were observed again at Parkes using the ATCA position with an observing setup termed 'MX' (see Green et al. 2009). 'MX' observations at 6030-MHz were also obtained at positions of 6035-MHz emission to detect potential counterpart ex-OH masers at this The level are split in to the left-hand 2 Π 3/2 and right-hand 2 Π 1/2 ladders by spin-orbit coupling. Each rotational level is split first into halves of opposite parity and then again by hyperfine splitting. The frequencies in MHz of emission are shown for various transitions below solid arrows for each J level. The values in bold next to dotted arrows give approximate wavelengths in microns. Figure and caption adapted from Gray (2012). frequency. The typical RMS noises in the MX observations at 6035-MHz and 6030-MHz are 0.10Jy and 0.11Jy respectively.


## Ex-OH ATCA observations

The positioning observations of forty-seven new ex-OH sources were made with ATCA in January 2009 over three days. Observations were conducted with the ATCA in the 6C configuration (maximum baseline 6.0km). The observations were made centred on the ex-OH 6035-MHz transition, with 2048 channels over a bandwidth of 4-MHz. The data were flux density and bandpass calibrated using the ATCA standard sources PKS B1934-638 and PKS B1921-293 respectively. Phase calibration was interleaved between on source observations of three to four maser sources which were close in position and velocity, using a calibration source local (typical offset < 10 • ) to that area of sky.

Further ATCA observations were taken in October 2013

and February 2014 to complete the source positioning for new sources. These observing runs were each taken in blocks over one (Oct. 2013) and two days (Feb. 2014) in the H214 and 6D configurations (maximum baselines 274m and 6.0km respectively). They focused on the more northerly sources from the MMB survey. The CABB correlator system (Wilson et al. 2011) had replaced the correlator system used in the 2009 observations, the new observing setup providing 10,240 channels over a 5.0MHz bandwidth (giving 0.488 kHz channels). These observations provided full Stokes polarisation (XX, YY, XY, YX) and also included observations of the 6030-MHz line. For the Oct 2013 observations in the H214 array configuration antenna 6 (at 6.0km) was excluded from the data reduction meaning these data were taken with five antennas leading to higher RMS values. The positional accuracy of all ATCA observations for the MMB survey is approximately 0.4 ′′ (Caswell et al. 2010). For all the ATCA observing epochs data reduction was conducted using the MIRIAD software package following standard ATNF reduction strategies for either pre-or post-CABB data.


# SURVEY RESULTS

A total of 127 6035-MHz and 32 6030-MHz ex-OH masers are found within the MMB survey region, Galactic longitudes 186 • < l < 60 • and latitudes |b| 2 • . We present in Table 1 the properties of the ex-OH masers found within this survey. Column 1 gives the source name defined as the source position in Galactic coordinates (rounded at the third decimal point) prefixed with MMBOH-G, columns 2 and 3 the J2000 Right Ascension and Declination co-ordinates. Column 4 the maser transition frequency, column 5 the literature or observational position reference for the RA and Dec. Columns 6, 7 and 8 give the maser peak flux density, peak velocity and a guideline velocity range from the Parkes MX of the LHCP maser emission, with columns 9, 10 and 11 the same for RHCP. The exceptions being sources 49.046−0.290 and 326.447−0.749 for which the Stokes I values from the ATCA data are presented in columns 6, 7 and 8 in italics. Figure 11 shows the Parkes MX spectra for each ex-OH maser with the exception of sources 49.046−0.290 and 326.447−0.749 for which the Stokes I spectra from ATCA is used as these sources are not present in the nearest Parkes MX. The full version of this figure is available in the online version only.

Finally, there remains one ex-OH maser, 189.030+0.783 clearly present in the Parkes MX data but for which we have been unable to attain an ATCA position. This source is at high positive declination where the beam of the ATCA becomes elongated and positioning becomes difficult. This source is included in Table 1, and Figures 3 and 11 but is not included in any analysis beyond §4.2.4.


## Remarks on sites of ex-OH maser emission

Here we provide additional information to that given in Table 1 on each of the 47 newly detected ex-OH sources, or those which have changed significantly since their last published observation. This additional information primarily focuses on association with 6030-MHz emission from the MMB MX observations and any nearby MMB CH3OH source. We also note if there are previous detections at 1665-MHz OH masers and then include any further comments. It should be noted that many of the new 6035-MHz detections are low flux density sources and as such there are only a small number of corresponding 6030-MHz detections (see §4.3 for these sources).

For new detections we systematically comment on the nearest detections in the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS; Rosolowsky et al. 2010;Aguirre et al. 2011) and the APEX Telecsope Large Area Survey of the GALaxy (AT-LASGAL, with sources prefixed AGAL; Schuller et al. 2009;Contreras et al. 2013;Urquhart et al. 2014) data. Both surveys trace dense clumps and cores in the mm/sub-mm indicative of regions of star formation which may be associated with the ex-OH in our sample. The BGPS covers a region of the Galactic plane from 349.5 • l 90.5 • , |b| 0.5 • ; with the latitude range extended to |b| 1.5 • in some regions see Aguirre et al. 2011 at 1.1mm with an effective resolution of 33 ′′ with ATLASGAL covering a region of 280 • l 60 • , −2 • < b < 1 • ( see Urquhart et al. see 2014) at 870µm with a beam full width half-maximum of 19.2 ′′ . We extend our search for nearby BGPS or AT-LASGAL sources out to 30 ′′ , approximately the resolution of BGPS (Schuller et al. 2009) and the median clumps size reported by Urquhart et al. (2014) for ATLASGAL. Additionally, we include the name of the nearest infrared to radio wavelength continuum source or star formation tracer to our ex-OH detection up to an angular separation of 5.0 ′′ equivalent to 0.1pc, the typical size of a star forming core at the fiducial distance to a high-mass star forming region of 5kpc.

For brevity some references to previous OH (both excited and ground-state) detection are abbreviated, these are as follows: FC89 is Forster & Caswell (1989) (1665-MHz, reported RMS noise ∼0.1Jy), CV95 is Caswell & Vaile (1995) (6035-MHz, typical detection limit ∼0.3Jy), C98 is Caswell (1998) (1665), A00 is Argon et al. (2000) (1665/7-MHz, detection limit 0.9-2.7Jy) and C03 is Caswell (2003) 620+0.194 and 9.622+0.196: NDs, Positions from ATCA-2009 data, the pair are separated by 12.0 ′′ . Each target has a 1665-MHz maser detected in C98, with a single detection at this site at 1665-MHz from FC89. No 6030-MHz detection from either source. These sources are small angular distances from the 6668-MHz maser pair G09. 619+0.193 and G09.621+0.196 (offsets 5.23 ′′ and 4.75 ′′ ) respectively. The 6668-MHz maser G09.621+0.1−96 is the brightest methanol maser detected in the MMB survey with a peak flux density of 5239.85Jy (Green et al. 2010), whereas the 6035-MHz peak flux density from the ATCA-2009 data is 0.2Jy and from the MMB MX data 0.24/0.25Jy (LHCP/RHCP, respectively). The methanol maser is also known to periodically vary on timescales of 244 days (van der Walt et al. 2009). 9.620+0.194 is coincident with BGPS G009.620+00.194 (within our positional uncertainties) and is likely associated with AGAL 009.621+00.194 (offset ∼ 4.1 ′′ ), whilst 9.622+0.196 sits at greater separation from both these sources at 12.2 ′′ and 9.6 ′′ respectively.  No 6030-MHz source detected in MX data. Offset from Compact / UC Hii region by 3.89 ′′ from e.g. Walsh et al. (1998) Green et al. 2009 and Ellingsen et al. in prep.). 6030-MHz data unavailable for this source. This source is an 'isolated' ex-OH sources (discussed in §4.4.4) with no MMB CH3OH detection within >200 ′′ and the nearest BGPS and ATLASGAL detections over an arcminute away. The MMB CH3OH maser G25.650+1.049 is offset by 5.8 ′′ . AGAL 025.649+01.051 is the nearest sub-mm detection at an angular offset of 3.9 ′′ , there is no nearby BGPS source.

28.819+0.366: ND, position from ATCA-2014 data. Not observed at 6030-MHz as part of the Parkes MMB survey, nor was a 6030-MHz maser seen in the ATCA-2014 data. No radio/mm sources within 5 ′′ , with the nearest ATLASGAL and BGPS sources 028.816+00.366 and G028.817+00.363 at angular offsets of 9.9 and 9.7 ′′ respectively. Over three epochs the 6035-MHz maser source has been increasing (by a factor 3.99 and 2.44 between its reported flux density in CV95 and C03 and the MMB result respectively, see Table 4). ATLASGAL detects a source (AGAL 035.197−00.742) offset from the maser peak position by 4.0 ′′ . There is no nearby BGPS detection.


## 35.200−1.736:

Known source at both 1665-MHz and 6035-MHz (FC89 and C03 respectively), see in absorption from MMB MX data at 6030-MHz. This maser source is seen to decrease in flux density between the two previous observations as reported by CV95 and C03 (by factors of -6.60 and -8.37 respectively). Interestingly in this time the polarization which displays peak emission at each epoch has switched handedness (  , C98 or A00. No nearby radio or mm-continuum source reported within 5 ′′ . This source is one of the 'isolated' ex-OH sources with no nearby CH3OH detection discussed in §4.4.4, the nearest mm/sub-mm sources from the ATLASGAL and BGPS surveys are offset by 59.0 ′′ and 56.6 ′′ respectively, meaning there is likely no association between these detection and the ex-OH maser. The nearest MMB CH3OH maser, G327.945−0.115, is at a separation of 3.7 ′′ with no other nearby radio or mmcontinuum source reported within 5 ′′ , the nearest sub-mm source in ATLASGAL (AGAL 327.948-00.117) is at an angular offset of 14.3 ′′ , meaning the maser and dense core are unlikely to be associated. 332.824−0.548: Known source. In both the 6035-MHz and 6030-MHz ATCA data there is a very strong continuum source (integrated flux density of 3.71±0.03Jy at 6035-MHz and 4.1±0.3Jy at 6030-MHz) at the same position as the 6035-MHz maser. There is no maser detected at 6030-MHz, instead this source appears in absorption. The nearest 6668-MHz CH3OH maser is offset from the ex-OH detection by 7.0 ′′ . Figure 2 shows the continuum emission as contours along with the 6035-MHz maser position. This source is likely associated with the nearby Hii candidate G332.8256-00.5498 seen in the RMS survey data (Mottram et al. 2007b), which is offset by 9.4 ′′ and the sub-mm source AGAL 332.826-00.549 is at a separation of 4.2 ′′ .  Guzmán et al. (2012). At a similar offset, 1.24 ′′ , lies the MMB CH3OH maser G337.844−0.375, at a greater offset but still potentially associated is the ATLASGAL source AGAL 337.844-00.376, which has a position offset from the ex-OH maser peak of 5.5 ′′ .  344.419+0.044: In this known source the -72.5kms −1 feature (0.28Jy) from CV95 is missing in the MMB spectrum. No spectrum in C03 for comparison. The emission at v=-65 to -62.8kms −1 seen in the MMB MX spectrum is also seen in the CV95 spectrum but were then weak ∼0.1Jy compared to the now missing -72.5kms −1 feature.


## 345.495+1

.469 ND, ATCA-2009 position. Two nearby 1665-MHz sources listed in C98, G345.494+1.469 and G345.498+1.467. The 6035-MHz peak is closest to G345.494+1.469 in velocity (peak velocity difference 0.4kms −1 ). The ex-OH detection is positioned to the northeast of radio sources 'C' and 'I-E' detected toward IRAS 16562−3959 by (Guzmán et al. 2010). Object 'C' being the proposed central object and 'I-E' the inner eastern lobe of the collimated jet the authors detect toward this massive young stellar object. The nearest MMB CH3OH maser, G345.498+1.467, to the ex-OH detection (offset by 13.12 ′′ ) is similarly positioned to the northeast of the 'C' and 'I-E' radio sources of Guzmán et al. (2010). In the same region is the sub-mm source AGAL 345.493+01.469 which is offset from the ex-OH maser by an angular separation of 6.3 ′′ .


## 354.725+0.299

Detected in C03, however incorrectly listed with negative Galactic latitude.

357.924−0.338 ATCA-2009 position. No detection listed in C98 or A00 of 1665-MHz maser, no 6030-MHz detection in MMB MX. CH3OH maser G357.924−0.337 from the MMB is offset by 3.9 ′′ , beyond this no radio or mm-continuum sources are reported within 5 ′′ with the nearest sub-mm detection at a slightly larger separation of 5.5 ′′ (AGAL 357.923-00.337).  Table 2 lists previously detected ex-OH sources for which the MMB survey MX shows no maser emission or a tentative detection that is below the MX observation noise. A tentative detection is considered such if there is structured emission at approximately the correct velocity of a previous detection (e.g. C03) but it falls below the 3σ RMS noise limit for the MX (listed in column 5 of Table 2). Non-detections show no such structure. Each of these sources is considered to have varied in flux density since its earlier detetcion to be below our detection threshold. The variability of masers in our sample is discussed in §4.5.

# DISCUSSION


## Galactic Distribution

The Galactic 6035-MHz maser population distribution as seen in our data can be seen graphically in Figure 3 (main panel). The leftmost and lower images in Figure 3 provide histograms of the distributions in Galactic latitude and longitude respectively.


### Longitude Distribution

We have binned our ex-OH sample into 5 degree bins to look at the distribution of masers within the Galaxy, as seen in the lower image of Figure 3. Across the whole MMB survey longitude range there is an average maser count per 5 • bin of 1.8, with a large standard deviation of 3. bin (with standard deviation of 3.4) implying a significant degree of clustering. The majority of the survey range, between the survey boundary at 186 • and 280 • , is free from maser detections, with only two masers observed in this region (at l=189.030 • and l=240.316 • ) (1.6% of the total ex-OH sample). Given our smaller sample size this would not seem to contradict the detection rate in the CH3OH survey which detected 22 CH3OH masers (2.3% of the CH3OH sample) in this same longitude range (Green et al. 2012a).

The clearest peak in the distribution is seen between 325 • and 340 • , the same longitude range as the Norma and Perseus (inner) tangent points (Vallée 2014). This peak in the distribution was also seen in the CH3OH maser population of Caswell et al. (2011). This region contains 28.3% of the ex-OH masers detected by the MMB survey.

Another notable peak, when compared to those surrounding it, appears within the 305 • and 310 • bin. This coincides with direction of the Crux tangent point (∼ 308 • Vallée 2014).

From 0 • to the other survey boundary of 60 • the distribution of masers is fairly uniform, with only a notable dip between 20 and 25 • and a tail-off after 50 • . The former is likely due to observations being made through the interarm region of the Perseus and Sagittarius arms toward the distant Perseus arm.


### Latitude Distribution

Of the 127 ex-OH masers 94% are within 1 • of the Galactic plane. Of those outside this latitude range 2 are new detections. In the MMB main survey catalogues (Caswell et al. 2010(Caswell et al. , 2011Green et al. 2010Green et al. , 2012aBreen et al. 2015) (hereafter the MMB catalogue papers), of the 972 6668-MHz masers 911 (94%) were found to be within 1 • of the Galactic plane, the same percentage seen in the 6035-MHz sources, indicative that the population of sources being traced by both species is comparable. The region with most 6668-MHz masers at latitudes more extreme than |b| 1 • was in the longitude range 186 • to 330 • (Green et al. 2012a) with 15% of detections at high/low latitudes. Our small number of 6035-MHz masers (30) in this region does not allow for a robust comparison however 7% of detections are found at |b| 1 • , which is more consistent with the general trend of 6035-MHz and 6668-MHz within the whole Galaxy.  Figure 4 (grey regions) are as per Dame & Thaddeus (2008). We use these models in order for the plot to be directly comparable with the latest of the MMB catalogue papers. We discuss the velocity range and number count of ex-OH masers in comparison to CH3OH using the same longitude ranges as the MMB catalogue papers.


## Velocity distribution and Galactic structure.


### Longitude 345 • -006 • , MMB Paper I

In the region covering the Galactic Centre we find 23 ex-OH masers, 18.1% of the total, covering a velocity range of -97 to 92 kms −1 . There is a significant overlap of all the Galactic spiral arms within this longitude range making comment on maser association with specific spiral arms difficult, however those masers near the extrema of our velocity range do have l − v properties which indicate they are within the near (high negative v) or far (high positive v) 3-kpc arms. These comprise four sources; 347.628+0.149 and 351.581−0.353, at negative velocity thus in the near 3kpc arm plus 0.666−0.029 and 0.666−0.035 at low l but high v making them candidates for inhabiting the far 3-kpc arm. However Caswell et al. (2010) point out that for the latter pair star formation tracing masers in this region are more likely to be part of the Sgr B2 star forming complex. The most extreme positive velocity source in this l range is 354.725+0.299 at a velocity of +91.76kms −1 , which, as can be seen in Figure 4, makes it an outlier with respect to the spiral arm structure of the Milky Way.  Caswell et al. (2010) found 183 CH3OH masers in this region, 18.9% of the CH3OH total, comparable to the proportion of ex-OH in our sample. The velocity range covered by these masers is -127 to 104 kms −1 exceeding the ex-OH velocity range of -97 to 92 kms −1 seen in our sample. Two methanol masers G354.701+0.299 and G354.724+0.300 from this region display peculiarly high positive velocities for the longitude, which are ascribed to these sources being in the Galactic bar. Our unusual ex-OH source 354.725+0.299 is separated spatially by 3.66 ′′ and 2.14kms −1 from G354.724+0.300 placing it also in the Galactic bar. The orbital properties of molecular gas in the inner 250pc (l =∼ ±1.7 • ) of the Milky Way have been found to display an eccentric (about Sgr A*), open (rather than closed) and warped (having vertical motion) orbit (Longmore et al. 2013;Kruijssen et al. 2015;Henshaw et al. 2016).

### Longitude 006 • -020 • , MMB Paper II

Within this longitude range we detect 16 ex-OH sources, 12.6% of total, which display a velocity range of -2.3 to 117.8 kms −1 . In l − v space there is a significant portion of all the major Galactic spiral arms within this l range, though it does appear that most of our negative velocity ex-OH masers are likely within the Norma arm rather than the Crux-Scutum arm (see Figure 4). Green et al. (2010) catalogued 119 CH3OH masers in this longitude range , 12.24% of the CH3OH total. Again the ex-OH and CH3OH proportion with respect to the source totals are comparable. The velocity range, -30.2 to 157kms −1 , of the CH3OH masers exceeds that of the ex-OH sample, particularly for those few sources with negative velocity < −10kms −1 which are thought to be part of the near 3kpc arm. Also unlike the CH3OH survey we do not appear to have detected any ex-OH masers in the far 3-kpc arm, which contains the CH3OH sample's high positive velocity sources in this region. 


### Longitude 330 • -345 • , MMB Paper III

A total of 30 ex-OH masers are found within this longitude range, 23.6% of total, covering a velocity range of -116.9 to 13.7 kms −1 . Figure 4 shows this region contains a significant part of the Norma, Crux-Scutum and Perseus Arms, with the majority of our sources appearing in the region of l − v space where Norma and Crux-Scutum overlap.

The 198 CH3OH masers found within this region make up 20.4% of total CH3OH population. This value differs by ∼3.2% from the ex-OH result, with a greater fraction of ex-OH found within this longitude range, though given the smaller ex-OH population this value is within counting statistics and may not be significant.

The CH3OH maser velocity range covers -127 to 19 kms −1 with just two sources contributing positive velocities. The ex-OH sample contains only a single source with positive velocity 343.929+0.125 which is positionally coincident with CH3OH maser G343.929+0.125, one of the two contributing the positive velocity from the CH3OH survey.


### Longitude 186 • -330 • , MMB Paper IV

We find 30 ex-OH masers within this area of sky (23.6% of the total). ex-OH masers in this region exhibit velocities in the range of -104.7 to 63.6kms −1 . This region contains a large section of the Crux-Scutum and the Carina-Sagittarius arms as well as a section of the Perseus arm (unconfused at high velocity >63kms −1 ) and the Norma tangent. We find two ex-OH masers within the Perseus arm which exists in this region, 189.030+0.738 and 240.316+0.071 (not seen in Figure 4 due to the truncated x-axis). The remainder of our masers in this region trace the remaining spiral arms well. Green et al. (2012a) report 207 CH3OH masers comprising 21.3% of the total MMB CH3OH sample a comparable percentage to our ex-OH statistics.


### Longitude 020 • -060 • , MMB Paper V

In this region we find 28 ex-OH masers inhabit this l range, (22.1% of total) over a velocity range 7.1 to 96.1 kms −1 . Notably in Figure 4, no ex-OH masers in our sample appear associated with the negative velocity components of the Norma or Crux-Scutum arms present in this l range.

Excited-state hydroxyl maser catalogue 11 Breen et al. (2015) catalogued 265 CH3OH masers in this region, 27.3% of the total. The proportion of CH3OH masers detected with respect to the total source counts is 5.2% greater than ex-OH masers, suggesting an underabundance of the latter species in this region.

The velocity range of CH3OH sources is -42.8 to 125.5 kms −1 appearing far greater than that of ex-OH, though in fact the majority (79%) of CH3OH masers fall within the same range of ex-OH with only 12 masers having V < 0kms −1 and 43 appearing above 100kms −1 .


## 6030-MHz ex-OH masers associated with 6035-MHz masers

We detect 32 6030-MHz ex-OH masers within the same sources as 6035-MHz masers in our catalogue, however there are 11 6035-MHz masers from our catalogue for which there is no 6030-MHz MX data and one for which there exist only RHCP data. Disregarding these 12 sources, 28% of our 6035-MHz sample has a 6030-MHz counter part. Previous studies of these two ex-OH transitions found percentages of 36% (Caswell 2003). We account for the difference between these two values in three ways. Firstly, by the fact that the MMB data have a typical MX RMS ∼ 0.1Jy (Green et al. 2009) which is higher than the typical spectrum RMS (0.03-0.05 Jy) reported by Caswell (2003) for their data. This may allow for the detection by Caswell (2003) of more lower flux density 6030-MHz counterparts than we were capable of, thus boosting their percentage. Secondly, the MMB is a complete untargeted survey meaning we may be seeing a number of sources at different evolutionary stages to that of the sample in Caswell (2003), which collated targeted surveys toward strong OH emission sites (Caswell 1997) and ground-state OH masers (Caswell 1998(Caswell , 2001. Finally, given the variability of the ex-OH transition (see section 4.5 for a discussion of this in the 6035-MHz line) a number of weak 6030-MHz masers previously detected maybe too weak for detection in our survey. Figure 5 compares the peak flux density of the 6035-MHz maser emission with that of the counterpart source at 6030-MHz at its peak velocity. The largest velocity offset between the two maser species peak emission seen in our data is 5.0kms −1 in source 49.490-0.388 (a feature also seen by C03), as such this is not included in Figure 5. For the remainder of sources the velocity displacement between peaks at the different frequencies is always below 2.6 kms −1 . Where there is a 6030-MHz ex-OH maser associated with a 6035-MHz maser, the 6030-MHz peak flux density never exceeds the counterpart 6035-MHz maser value. This result is consistent with the ex-OH maser model results of Gray et al. (1992), Cragg et al. (2002) and the majority of observational results (e.g, Baudry et al. 1997;Desmurs & Baudry 1998;Caswell 2003). Baudry et al. (1997) report 6030/6035-MHz typical flux density ratios of 0.14 to 0.5, and similarly Caswell (2003) reports a typical values of 0.125, up to extremes such as 0.01. Such values are consistent with our findings (Figure 5). 


### Flux density comparison


## Methanol maser association

The works of Ellingsen et al. (2007) and Breen et al. (2010a) suggest that masers of different species provide an evolutionary time line of regions of high-mass star formation. The simultaneous occurrence of class II CH3OH and ground-state OH masers occurs later on in the relative lifetime of a highmass star formation region (Breen et al. 2010a, see their Figure 6.), whilst it remains unclear about the association epoch of class II CH3OH and ex-OH species. Given our sample of ex-OH masers are drawn from the same Galactic plane survey as the class II CH3OH masers we are in a position to give robust information on the association rates of the two species.


### Angular Separation

For each of the observed ex-OH masers the closest class II CH3OH maser (in terms of angular separation) was determined; the CH3OH maser positions were taken from the MMB catalogues. Figure 6 shows the distribution of angular separation between our ex-OH masers and the nearest class II CH3OH masers. Within this figure we show only sources with angular separations, θ 30 ′′ (equivalent to ∼1pc at a distance of 5kpc). Sources at larger separations, referred to hereafter as 'isolated' ex-OH masers, are discussed in §4.4.4.

As can be seen in Figure 6 the majority of ex-OH masers, ∼80%, are within θ 10 ′′ (∼0.25pc at 5kpc) of a CH3OH maser, where one would assume that the majority of these sources are associated with the same star forming core (nominal size ∼0.1pc), forming one or more stellar sources.

Of this 80% the largest proportion (64 sources), are within 2 ′′ (∼0.05pc at 5kpc) a separation at which one may assume both are associated with the same protostellar object (c.f. the fiducial size of a hyper compact Hii region ( 0.03pc), e.g. Kurtz 2005).

In their pilot study of ground-state OH masers in Carina-Sagittarius Green et al. (2012b) use an association limit of 'coincident within the positional errors'. Applying this same limit to our ex-OH data (0.4 ′′ , 9.7mpc at 5kpc) we find 26 sources meeting this criteria, for these sources one would confidently assume each maser species are part of the same protostellar system. Figure 7 plots the peak velocity of each maser species against its nearest counterpart for all sources with an ATCA position and clearly shows that there is a tight correlation between the two masing species across all velocities. Figure  8 gives the velocity difference, ∆V , of potential ex-OH -CH3OH maser pairs plotted against the angular separation of the sources. In this figure it can be seen that the majority of ex-OH masers are within ± 5.0kms −1 (denoted by the two green horizontal dashed lines) of their positional counterpart CH3OH maser. This is particularly true for those sources with angular separations of θ 2 ′′ (left of the vertical dotted line), with only 5 of 64 sources outside the ±5.0kms −1 range, and 2 ′′ < θ 10 ′′ (left of the vertical dot-dash line), with 7 of 37 sources outside this range.

Also indicative of true associations for the majority of low angular separation maser pairs is the fact that the mean |∆V | increasingly deviates from |∆V | = 0 from the 2 ′′ grouping through 2 ′′ < θ 10 ′′ up to the θ > 10 ′′ group (see column 3 in the upper portion of Table 3). There is also an increase in the standard deviation (column 4 Table 3) between the each group.


### Physical Separation

A large number of MMB methanol sources were assigned a distance in Green & McClure-Griffiths (2011), which used Hi self-absorption data to resolve the near/far kinematic distance ambiguity for these masers. Of our sample of 126 1 ex-OH masers 118 have likely associated CH3OH counterparts in the Green & McClure-Griffiths (2011) study.

Additionally, Reid et al. (2014) have released parallax distance measurements of a large number of CH3OH (both 6.7 and 12.2 GHz) masers, eight of which are likely counterparts to our ex-OH and the MMB sources. For these sources we use the parallax distance in place of the Hi self-absorption distance. Sources for which the near/far distance ambiguity remains, i.e. they have no Hi or parallax distance, are not considered further in this association analysis, nor are sources where the ex-OH and CH3OH maser are separated by 30 ′′ . Leaving 91 potential maser pairs.

Assuming that these 91 ex-OH and CH3OH potential pairs both exist at the same distance we can repeat the analysis from the previous section using physical, Θ, rather than angular separation.

The lower panel of Table 3 presents this quantitatively. We divide our sample into maser pairs of separations 0.03pc (the HCHii size scale), between 0.03pc < Θ 0.1pc (between HCHii and protostellar core size scale) and greater that 0.1pc. Again we find an increase in mean |∆V | with increasing separation, indicative of looser association between species. Figure 9 follows Figure 8, but using the physical separation between maser species for those with assigned distances from Green & McClure-Griffiths (2011) or Reid et al. (2014). We find that only four sources of forty-one in our smallest physical separation group have have |∆V | > 5 kms −1 (left of dotted line).

From this, one could take a very conservative lower limit of true associations with the 972 class II CH3OH masers from the MMB as being 37 ex-OH sources; at separations 0.03pc with |∆V | 5kms −1 .


### Ex-OH maser lifetimes

van der Walt (2005) used a statistical analysis of the then known number of 6668-MHz CH3OH masers in the Milky Way to estimate the lifetime of an individual CH3OH maser source, finding a value of between 2.5 and 4.5×10 4 years. Taking this value and the occurrence of associated pairs between the MMB CH3OH and ex-OH masers (29.4%) we can calculate a lifetime for an ex-OH maser source.

Firstly, we assume that ex-OH and 6668-MHz CH3OH masers are associated for a single period during the formation of a high-mass star and that all our associated pairs are forming in high-mass star forming regions 2 . Given these assumptions the timescale for coexistence for these maser species can be calculated:
τcoexist = N meth+exOH N meth τ meth(1)
where τcoexist is the time of species coexistence, N meth+exOH the number of associated ex-OH and CH3OH pairs in our survey, N meth the total number of CH3OH maser in the same survey region and τ meth the CH3OH maser lifetime as calculated by van der Walt (2005). Using our conservative lower limit of 37 maser pairs and the total of 972 CH3OH maser in the MMB catalogues this gives a timescale of coexistence for these maser species of 950 to 1700 years. This coexistence timescale allows us to next estimate the lifetime of the ex-OH masers themselves. We find 29.4% of our sample are coexisting with CH3OH masers, which is equivalent to the ex-OH masers spending 29.4% of their total lifetime in associated with CH3OH meaning that the total lifetime, τexOH, can be calculated using the equivalent formula to 1:
τcoexist = N meth+exOH NexOH τexOH (2)
where NexOH is the total number of ex-OH maser in our sample and other symbols have their previous meanings. Following this approach we calculate that the total lifetimes of ex-OH maser sources are between 3.3×10 3 to 5.8×10 3 years.

If we expand our associated sample (N meth+exOH ) to include all sources with separations less than 0.1pc with |∆V | between ±5.0kms −1 this gives 55 associated pairs, a coexistence timescale of 1400 to 2500 years and an estimated life time of 4.6×10 3 to 8.3×10 3 years for ex-OH. This value is shorter than that expected of the ground-state OH maser of a f ew × 10 4 years (Fish & Reid 2006). Finally, we note two caveats relavent to the above calculated values. First we do not take into account the potential existence of ex-OH masers around post main sequence stars, but given the rarity of such masers and the lack of detection of such sources in our sample (see §4.4.4) the effect of such contamination on the estimated value will be of the order a few percent, much smaller the estimated lifetime ranges we calculate. Second, if the assumption that 6668-MHz CH3OH masers and ex-OH masers exist at only a single epoch during star formation is not true then our values would act as an upper limit for ex-OH maser lifetime.


### Isolated ex-OH sources: Separation 30 ′′

From Figure 8 it can also be seen that 11 ex-OH sources have separations from the nearest CH3OH maser greater than 100 ′′ up to 764 ′′ which at a fiducial 5kpc distance to a high-mass star forming region gives a separation in excess of 2pc up to 18.5pc. Whilst this separation is sufficiently small that the sources could reside in the same giant molecular cloud (typical size 100pc see e.g Larson 2003), which may account for some of the low ∆V values for these sources, it is very unlikely that these masers are truly associated and being excited by the same source. Beyond this, there are a further three sources which appear truly isolated with no counterpart from the MMB catalogues found within tens of arcminutes, these being 8.352+0.478, 240.316+0.071 and 284.016−0.856. We inspected the literature for counterparts to these three extremely isolated masers, finding an interesting diversity of star formation tracing counterparts between them. Source 8.352+0.478 has no counterpart dense core in either BGPS or ATLASGAL within 30 ′′ and no other maser species detections within 1.0 ′′ . Source 284.016−0.856 similarly has no other maser species present within 1.0 ′′ , but does (as noted in § 3.1) have a likely associated dense core AGAL 284.016−00.857 offset by 4.8 ′′ . The source 240.316+0.071 has a close, 1.0 ′′ , water maser counterpart listed in both Breen et al. (2010b) and Reid et al. (2014) and a groundstate OH maser at an offset position of 0.74 ′′ . This source is outside of the survey range for both BGPS or ATLAS-GAL, but does have nearby, 1.0 ′′ millimetre and radio wavelength detections associated with the (ultra) compact Hii region G240.31+0.07 (see e.g. Chen et al. 2007;Trinidad 2011). Finally, the literature provides no nearby ( 30 ′′ ) evolved/post main sequence star counterparts for any isolated maser sources suggesting that these masers are associated with star formation.

In the modelling of Cragg et al. (2002) it was found that the 6035-MHz ex-OH maser can exist at densities up to nH = 10 8.5 cm −3 which exceeds the density at which the 6668-MHz CH3OH maser is quenched by collisional interaction (nH = 10 8.3 cm −3 ). The isolated ex-OH masers we detect may be tracing these extreme high density regions and warrant further investigation to examine their environments.    


## Variability

To inspect the variability of the ex-OH sources over time a comparison of the flux densities for sources observed in either CV95 and/or C03 and the MMB MX's was made. The MMB MX data was obtained 2008/2009, CV95 data were mostly taken in 1993/1994, giving a minimum time baseline of 14 years. The C03 data were taken in 2001 giving a minimum time baseline of 7 years. The CV95/C03 reported peak flux densities and spectra were inspected to ensure that for sources which we had an MX, the CV95/C03 peak was within 1.0km/s of the MX peak for the same polarisation. Only masers where the peak matched in velocity and polarisation were used in the comparison, thus excluding those with multi-component spectra where a different velocity component now dominates (as discussed in §3.1).

In total the comparison was made with 61 sources from CV95 and 77 sources from C03. Figure 10 plots the comparison of the MMB peak flux densities, including the sources which were found to be tentative or non-detections from the MMB MX data (see §3.2) for which 3σ upper limits were used. The ratios of flux densities for CV95/MMB and C03/MMB have median values of 0.92 and 0.94 respectively, but as can be seen from Figure 10 a number of sources, 19 from CV95 and 11 from C03, have varied by a factor of 2 over at least one of the two periods. These highly variable sources are listed in Table 4. For those sources where the variation is 2 over only one epoch, the variation over the other epoch is also listed (where possible) to highlight any trend within the variation.

The majority of these highly variable sources show the variation acting in the same direction, either increasing or decreasing, over both epochs to the MMB. Four sources (19.486+0.151, 49.486-0.389, 345.003-0.224 and 345.487+0.314 ) have variation acting in the opposite direc- Figure 10. Comparison of ex-OH masers observed as part of the MMB with those previously observed in CV95 (red) and C03 (blue), sources which are tentative or none-detections (see §3.2) are marked as downward arrows of the same colour. The dashed line indicated y=x, and the solid lines y=2x and y=x/2. tion between the CV95-MMB and C03-MMB epochs. An additional 4 sources (11.904-0.141, 15.035-0.677, 35.200-1.736 and 345.010+1.792 ) show a switch in sense of variation between the CV95 to C03 and the C03 to MMB measurements, but had sufficient variation over the CV95 to MMB period to show an overall continuing positive or negative trend when comparing CV95-MMB and C03-MMB. For these 8 sources the variation must have reached a maximum/minimum at some point between either CV95 and C03 or C03 and MMB observations which may be indicative of variation on a timescale of years or less in these sources, making them interesting candidates for single dish monitoring observations.


# SUMMARY

We present the results from the first complete Galactic Plane survey of ex-OH masers at 6035-MHz. This survey was carried out as part of the Methanol MultiBeam Survey using the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. The catalogue of sources comprises 127 sources with 47 new detections. All the new detections have high accuracy positions from interferometric observations with the ATCA. In addition to the measured 6035-MHz sources we also catalogue associated 6030-MHz ex-OH masers, detecting 32 masers at this frequency. The 6030-MHz emission is typically weaker that at 6035 consistent with previous studies.

The catalogue is compared to the main MMB catalogue of 6668-MHz CH3OH masers (comprising 972 detections), from which we find an unambiguous association (sources separated by 0.4 ′′ , 9.7mpc at 5kpc) for just 26 sources. Increasing the association limit to 2 ′′ (0.05pc at 5kpc, the approximate scale of a single proto-stellar core) we find 64 CH3OH−ex-OH pairs. In our sample 91 ex-OH sources have a robust distance measurements allowing physical separations to be calculated. Of these we find 37 likely CH3OH−ex-OH maser pairs with physical separations of 0.03pc and 55 pairings separated by 0.1pc.

Assuming a single epoch of coexistence of CH3OH and ex-OH masers around a high-mass protostellar source and using the van der Walt (2005) estimated CH3OH maser lifetime, we are able to put constraints on the coexistence period of the two maser species and the ex-OH maser lifetime, using our associated pairs with distance measurements. We find a period of maser overlap of 0.95 − 2.5 × 10 3 and a lifetime for ex-OH masers of 3.3 − 8.3 × 10 3 years.

Finally we compare the observed peak 6035-MHz emission to that observed at previous epochs by Caswell & Vaile (1995) and Caswell (2003). We find over these periods that the majority of ex-OH masers have varied, mostly by less that a factor of two. However, twenty-three sources have varied by more than a factor of two. Some of these sources have also changed the direction of variability (increasing to decreasing or vice versa) between the three observing times, suggestive of variation on short timescales.

One important feature of ex-OH masers is their sensitivity to the local magnetic field. A companion paper will present the results of the polarisation data of the ex-OH masers and the derived on the magnetic field strengths (Avison et al. in prep).

The nearest MMB CH3OH maser, G320.424+0.089, is at an angular offset of 50.5 ′′ so is highly unlikely to be associated with the ex-OH detection. 326.447−0.749 and 326.448−0.749 Newly detected maser pair separated by 3.4 ′′ with positions from ATCA-2009.

No 6030-MHz or 1665-MHz detections from the MMB MX data and C98, respectively. G333.068−0.447 at an offset of 1.9 ′′ is the closest MMB CH3OH maser detected. The young stellar object (YSO) candidate G333.0682-00.4461(1) from the RMS survey is at an angular offset of 1.86 ′′ (Mottram et al. 2007b).

Central Molecular Zone: In recent years (since the publication of Caswell et al. 2010) there has been significant advancement in the understanding of the orbital behaviour of molecular gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way.


this region we find four ex-OH masers 0.666−0.029 and 0.666−0.035 which Caswell et al. (2010) previously associated with Sgr B2 and 357.924−0.338 and 359.137+0.031. Using the best-fit orbital solution of Kruijssen et al. (2015) (plotted as black dot-dash in Figure 4) we find that indeed 0.666−0.029 and 0.666−0.035 seem to indeed fall very well on this orbital path toward the position of Sgr B2. 357.924−0.338 is at too low a latitude to be expected to follow the CMZ orbit and 359.137+0.031 lies outside of this orbital path and at velocities more consistent with association with one of the spiral arms.

## Figure 4 .
4l-V lsr distribution of ex-OH masers within the galaxy. ex-OH sources are plotted as black circles at the source peak velocity, the errorbars give the velocity range of the maser source. The spiral arms (coloured as Norma -red, Carina-Sagittarius -blue, Perseusgreen, Crux-Scutum -yellow, Local arm -broken pink) followGeorgelin & Georgelin (1976) modified byTaylor & Cordes (1993), using theReid et al. (2009) rotation curve. The dark central bands in each colour show the loci of each arm with the paler shaded regions showing the parameter space covered by arms of width 1kpc with velocity ±7kms −1 that of the loci. The near and far 3kpc arms are represented as grey regions, followingDame & Thaddeus (2008). The thin black dot-dash line around l = 0 • shows the best-fit open orbit model for molecular clouds in the CMZ fromKruijssen et al. (2015). Note: For clarity of the majority of sources the x-axis has been truncated and that two sources exist at l < 280 • .

The horizontal red (solid) and green (dashed) lines denoted ∆V of 0kms −1 and ±5kms −1 respectively. The vertical dotted and dash-dot line mark out angular separations of 2 and 10 ′′ respectively. Note: the log x-axis excludes those few sources where the maser coordinates are identical thus having a separation of zero.

Excited-state hydroxyl maser catalogue 7 339.980−0.539 ND, from ATCA-2009. Non detection in 6030-MHz in MMB MX data. No 1665-MHz in C98 or FC89. Radio source GPSR 339.980-0.538 at 1.4GHz is offset by 1.77 ′′(Zoonematkermani et al. 1990). At a larger offset of 2.6 ′′ is the MMB CH3OH maser G339.980−0.538 and at greater still offset (5.3 ′′ ) is compact sub-mm source AGAL 339.979-00.539. 341.974+0.225 ND, from ATCA-2009. Not detected in 6030-MHz in MMB MX data, nor is there a 1665-MHz maser in C98 or FC89. This maser is at an angular offset of 5 ′′ from sub-mm source AGAL 341.974+00.226. The nearest CH3OH maser reported by the MMB is G341.973+0.233 at a separation of 29.8 ′′ so unlikely to exist around the same ionising source.

Table 2. List of previous ex-OH maser detections which were either non-detections or tentative (see text) in the MMB survey MX 
observations. Positions and velocities listed are from Caswell (2003). The upper limit listed in column 5 is 3× the RMS noise in the MX 
for that source. a The status is either 'N' for non-detection or 'T' for tentative. 




Table 4. Table of sources which have increased or decreased by a factor of ±2 or more. Negative values show a decrease in flux density between epochs and positive an increase. For each epoch the polarisation handedness is denoted with R or L in parenthesis in the two MMB column, highlighting which those sources where the handedness has changed. For tentative or non-detected MMB sources the upper limit value is given and only variability between epochs where the previous detection was above this upper limit is listed.Source Name

## Table 1 :
1MMB Survey ex-OH Catalogue. Columns 1: Source Name, which is defined as the source position in Galactic coordinates (rounded at the third decimal point). Columns 2 & 3: source position ins Right Ascension and Declination (sources with positions from MMB observations have three decimal places in RA and two in Dec, all previously detected masers have two and one decimal accuracy respectively). Column 4: The ex-OH transition for the listed maser, counterpart 6030-MHz masers are listed directly below their 6035-MHz partner. Column 5: Reference for the position listed, with the following abbreviations ATCA 09, ATCA 13 and ATCA 14 denote our ATCA observation resutls from 2009, October 2013 and February 2014 respectively observations. C03 =Caswell (2003),C01 = Caswell (2001). Columns 6 to 11: The ex-OH maser peak flux density, velocity of peak and a minimum-maximum velocity range over which emission is seen in the spectrum, first for left hand circular polarisation (LHCP) and then right hand circular polarisation (RHCP). Sources in italics are values for Stokes I (total intensity) flux density taken from the respective ATCA observation as these sources are not present in the nearest Parkes MX. As such only columns 7 to 9 are filled in. † Sources 333.136−0.432 and 333.135−0.431 have a blended spectrum preventing a complete velocity range to be estimated from the MX data.Excited-state hydroxyl maser catalogue 19Source Name
