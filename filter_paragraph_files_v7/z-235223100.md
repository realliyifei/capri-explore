## (s3) SNP identification from sequenced genomes
Number of References: 5

(p3.0) Currently, many crop species genomic sequences have been released. Sequenced genomes can be used to identify big amounts of SNPs in several respects. SNPs can be mined immediately in the genomic sequence in the event of heterozygous species such as grape or poplar, since two genome models have actually been produced. Two distinct specimens were sequenced in the scenario of rice (26) and grape (27) so that SNPs can be mined by comparing the two genome models (28). For Arabidopsis thaliana , genome resequencing panels were built based on the Col-0 chromosome sequences and used among 20 genotypes to identify SNPs based on hybridization (29,30).
