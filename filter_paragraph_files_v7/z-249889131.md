Number of References: 4

(p3.0) (ST-GTLR) is an iterative and responsive literature review method that applies the five-step framework of define, search, select, analyse and present described in the original GTLR guidelines by Wolfswinkel et al. [11] with concrete data analysis (and optional theory development) steps of socio-technical grounded theory [10]. A GTLR is particularly well suited to studying niche and emerging research areas to gain in-depth understanding, establish theoretical foundations, and make practical recommendations.

(p5.0) The first step is to formulate the initial review protocol, including determining the scope of the study by defining inclusion and/or exclusion criteria, publication period, and search items, followed by databases to search in, research questions, and search strings. Following this approach, we defined our inclusion and exclusion criteria, publication period, language of the articles to be included followed by the guiding research question (RQ), search string and appropriate sources and specific search items with the aim 1. The term 'developers' in our study include AI programmers, practitioners, engineers, specialists, experts, designers, and stakeholders. We use the terms 'AI developers' and 'developers' interchangeably throughout our study.   [10] of obtaining maximum relevant primary empirical studies. The RQ was formulated to gain an overall understanding of ethics in AI from the perspective of AI developers, as:

## (s6) What do we know from literature about how developers view ethics in AI?
Number of References: 4

(p6.0) Four popular digital databases, namely, ACM Digital Library (ACM DL), IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink and Wiley Online Library (Wiley OL) were used as sources to identify the relevant literature. These databases have been regularly used to conduct reviews on human aspects of software engineering, e.g., [35], [36]. Initially, we searched for relevant studies which were published in journals and conferences only and for which full texts were available.
## (s7) Search
Number of References: 4

(p7.0) The second stage involves performing the actual search using the review protocol defined in the first stage [11]. We performed the search using our seed review protocol presented in Table 2. The search process was iterative and time-consuming because some essential synonyms of the search terms were missing initially, and we had to revisit the define stage again and again before moving to the next stage (e.g. see the initial and final search strings developed for this study in Table 1).

## (s8) Select

(p8.0) The selection of sample texts is done in this stage. The steps include (i) filtering out doubles, (ii) refining sample based on title and abstract, (iii) refining sample based on full text, (iv) scanning forward and backward citations, and (v) checking if new articles come up in the last step as these steps are iterative [11]. If new articles come up in the last step, researchers should go to step (i) and follow other steps accordingly. If no new articles come up, then that will be the final sample to be included in the study.
## (s9) Analyse
Number of References: 4

(p9.0) We applied Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) to conduct our review because its socio-technical research framework is customised to fit the unique socio-technical contexts of domains such as software engineering and artificial intelligence [10].

(p9.1) â€¢ Socio-technical phenomenon: The topic of studying ethics in AI from the developers' viewpoint presents a distinctly socio-technical phenomenon, where "the social and technical aspects are interwoven in a way that studying one without due consideration of the other makes for an incomplete investigation and understanding" [10].
## (s10) Inclusion Criteria
Number of References: 2

(p10.0) Each study must be a full text published journal article or Each study must be a full text published journal article, conference paper conference paper, students' thesis, report or paper on arXiv STGT includes basic data analysis procedures such as open coding, constant comparison, and memoing that are common to all GT variants and advanced data analysis procedures such as options of targeted data collection and analysis (DCA) and theoretical structuring or structured DCA and theoretical integration, depending on the researchers' choice of emergent or structured modes of theory development respectively [10]. In our ST-GTLR, we applied open coding, constant comparison, memoing in the basic stage and targeted DCA and theoretical structuring in the advanced stages using the emergent mode of theory development.
## (s13) Present
Number of References: 4

(p13.0) The last step of the ST-GTLR process is to present the findings. The key findings are presented through textual descriptions accompanied by original quotations from the included primary studies. Furthermore, Wolfswinkel et al. recommends, "presenting findings using visualisations such as diagrams can help reach a wider audience" [11]. To visualise the findings of the 30 primary empirical studies, we created model diagrams (Figures 4 and 5).

Number of References: 8

(p35.0) A grounded theory is not limited to a set of descriptive categories -it also explains the key relationships between those categories, such as through a set of interrelated hypotheses [10], [37]. We have presented the five key categories -Developer Awareness, Developer Perception, Developer Needs, Developer Challenges and Developer Approach -in Section 4, that emerged through the data analysis of 30 primary studies. In this section, we present the relationships between those categories as five interrelated hypotheses. We also analyse how changes in one category impacts the changes in another category. By analysing the relationships between categories facilitated by memoing, we derived the grounded theory of ethics in AI through the developer's prism. Figure  5 presents the theory diagram resulting from theoretical structuring, with key categories and hypotheses (H1-H5).

## (s57) CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Number of References: 4

(p57.0) AI systems are as ethical as the humans developing them. It is critical to understand how the humans in the trenches, the AI developers, view the topic of ethics in AI if we are to a lay firm theoretical foundation for future work in this area. With this in mind, we formulated the research question: What do we know from literature about how developers view ethics in AI? To address this, we conducted a sociotechnical grounded theory literature review (ST-GTLR) by applying the overarching framework of grounded theory literature review (GTLR) introduced by Wolfswinkel et al. [11] with the concrete steps of the socio-technical grounded theory (STGT) method for data analysis and theory development [10], on 30 primary empirical studies. Since there were not many empirical studies addressing our niche topic and RQ exclusively, a grounded theory-based iterative and responsive review approach worked well to identify and extract relevant content from across multiple studies (that mainly focused on related topics), while the application of STGT enabled rigour analysis and theory development. A contribution of this paper is the ST-GTLR guidelines for conducting review studies in software engineering, especially on niche and emerging topics.
