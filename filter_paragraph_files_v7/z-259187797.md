(p3.0) We build upon [5] extractive text summarization system to perform the NLPsupported systematic literature review. In this work, we followed [5] first six steps and, at the end, introduced three new ones ( Figure 2): 1) PDF Text Extraction; 2) Text Classification and Filtering; 3) Text Normalization; 4) IMRAD Context Detection; 5) Sentence Segmentation; 6) Sentence Filtering; 7) Identification of Verbs used to Report Findings; 8) Extraction of Words Based on Verbs; and 9) Network Visualization. In the following paragraphs, we further explain each step from Figure 2 while using the data from our application as an example.
