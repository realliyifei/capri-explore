(p4.0) In the United States and Europe, ketorolac injections are widely used as an injectable painkiller.It is commonly used because of the high analgesic power of ketorolac.In the control of acute pain, its analgesic effect is similar to injectable opioids such as morphine and pethidine (58).The absence of respiratory depression, the lack of dependence, and the long-lasting effect of relief are some of the most important advantages of ketorolac compared to injectable opioids.Also, ketorolac and injectable opioids have synergistic effects with each other and can reduce the necessary dose of opioids by simultaneous administration of injected ketorolac and opioids (59)(60)(61).Another study showed no significant difference in pain control with morphine or ketorolac.However, the simultaneous use of both reduces the need for rescue therapy.Complications were reduced in the morphine combined with ketorolac group (62).The results of the Victor study showed that pain relief after pethidine or ketorolac was significant, but the time to return to normal work after taking ketorolac was shorter (63).

(p4.1)  Ibuprofen Many physicians believe that among the NSAIDs, ketorolac has more analgesic power than oral ibuprofen (64).However, a review of studies has shown that oral ibuprofen has a similar analgesic effect to parenteral ketorolac (65).On the other hand, studies have shown that ketorolac can cause significant bleeding after some surgical procedures such as post-tonsillectomy (66,67).However, a Cochrane review showed that NSAIDs are not a significant factor in the incidence of bleeding (68).A study by Moss et al. showed that analgesia induced by injected ibuprofen not only reduced the need for opioid use in the opioid group but also reduced complications such as nausea (67).In contrast to the opiate and paracetamol drugs, ibuprofen has anti-inflammatory properties, which can play an essential role in limiting inflammatory cascades and reducing pain, especially after invasive procedures (67).It is clinically important to use this drug as an analgesic, especially in children, where the use of opiates can have more risks and complications (69).
