(p31.0) This article provides the most comprehensive overview of knowledge on the effectiveness of organizationallevel psychosocial work environment interventions to date.Compared with other overviews of reviews of interventions targeting the psychosocial work environment (13)(14)(15)(16)(17), our study identified the largest number of reviews by far, covering almost one thousand organizational-level intervention studies.The identification of 52 reviews of moderate or strong quality made it possible to investigate the quality of evidence of different types of organizational-level interventions.We showed that organizational-level interventions can differ in their complexity regarding implementation, and that only a few types of interventions with moderate-to-strong quality of evidence have been demonstrated to make changes in the more distal health outcomes.
