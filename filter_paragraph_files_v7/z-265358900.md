(p0.0) The rapid development and widespread use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have had a profound impact on society.The advancements in communication facilitated by these technologies have created a global era where unlimited information can be transmitted quickly from any location (Buhalis et al., 2019).This technological evolution has also led to the emergence of reality-virtuality technologies, such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and pure mixed reality (PMR), which are transforming the way customers experience both the real and virtual environments (Tom Dieck and Hang, 2022).AR involves overlaying digital information in the real environment.In VR, users are fully immersed in computergenerated environments, providing a completely virtual experience.PMR combines real and digital elements, enabling their coexistence and interaction with the user (Flavi an et al., 2019).Recent reports note that the immersive technologies market size is expected SJME to reach US$100bn by 2026 (Statista, 2023), which highlights the importance of these technologies for the future development of society.
