## (s0) Introduction

(p0.0) Biotechnological products play an ever-increasing role for several sectors of the producing industry. In the medical sector, some of such processes are already established (e.g., insulin production), and also the pharma industry takes more and more advantage of biotechnology (e.g., CAR-T therapies). In food production, gene-modified plants promise higher yield using less pesticides. In a few years, meat grown in the laboratory may be found in grocery stores [1]. Another novel sector is that of synthetic biology, where biological products and their gene codes are fully engineered to create food, medicine or even replacements for technical parts [2].
## (s2) Basic Requirements for Automation

(p2.0) In this section, the basic requirements for automating a laboratory process that is so far performed manually are presented. These prerequisites address the equipment used during the execution of the protocol, the physical and software interfaces that depend on it, material transport, and the need for control software [4,14,17]. If automation was not considered during the early stages of the development cycle, these requirements represent major challenges for the operator [4].
