(p2.0) Since discovery of bacteriophage by Francis Type of circuit and Walter d'Herelle a century earlier, researchers have shown that phages can cure microbial enterococcus illnesses like cholera, correctly selected, and giardiasis in addition to a diversity of acute or prolonged pathogens in fields like cardiology, gastroenterology, cardiology, neonatology, and multiple surgeries (Wittebole et al., 2014). Since then, such infectious beings have been utilized for a variety of farming applications, as well as for animal and human uses, even though to our understanding, advertising bacteriophage therapy on local food have never been recorded (Sillankorva et al., 2012). Fresh produce-related episodes of contaminated food have highlighted the importance of practical methods to eliminate harmful bacteria from food. It has been demonstrated that traditional commercial sanitizers fail to eliminate harmful bacteria from either the skins of fruits and vegetables (Bhardwaj et al., 2015).
