(p1.0) People spend most of their time indoors [45]. Because outdoor air pollution infiltrates into buildings, "indoor air" contains both indoor-and outdoor-generated pollution [46]. Indoor exposures account for 61% and 81% of the deaths attributed to outdoor-generated PM 2.5 in the USA and China, respectively [47,48]. Thus, reducing PM 2.5 indoors may also mitigate the impacts of outdoor-generated particles.
