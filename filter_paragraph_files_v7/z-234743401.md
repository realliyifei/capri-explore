## (s6) Effects of Green Tea Catechins on Endometriosis
Number of References: 2

(p6.0) Endometriosis is a chronic disorder characterised by the implantation of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity [33]. It affects adolescents and reproductive-aged women and is commonly associated with chronic pelvic pain and infertility [34]. EGCG, the most abundant component found in green tea, has a beneficial effect against endometriosis.
## (s8) Effects of Green Tea Catechins on PCOS
Number of References: 3

(p8.0) PCOS is a combination of complex reproductive, endocrine and metabolic syndrome [42]. Approximately 6-10% (defined by 1990 NIH criteria) of reproductive women have been affected by PCOS, and the incidence rates doubled according to Rotterdam or Androgen Excess-PCOS Society criteria [43]. Currently, PCOS has no definite treatment, symptomatic treatment alone is being implemented [44]. Green tea and its derivatives, catechins, have beneficial health effects against PCOS. We found three clinical trials and one animal study exploring the effect of green tea or its derivative catechin against PCOS ( Table 4). Most of these studies showed the positive health effects against PCOS, suggesting that green tea is a supplement for currently available drugs for PCOS.
