(p11.0) Many transduction methods involve observation of a change in the electrical conditions in the system. Frequently, the simple act of binding of detection molecule and antigen can lead to a change in the electrical characteristics of the biosensor, including the potential, current, resistance, and/or impedance. Oligonucleotide hybridization on a positively charge nanomembrane [81] and glycoprotein binding to a membrane [90] were observed and quantified using electrodes and the resultant current vs. voltage (resistance) plot. Another group quantified bacterial binding to a membrane by recording the change in membrane resistance upon binding [73].
