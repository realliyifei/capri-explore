(p5.0) The treatment of SAP depends on illness severity and also on the patient's clinical condition.After the diagnosis of SAP, it is necessary to predict severity of the disease using various scoring systems: APACHE II, SOFA or BISAP.In the management of SAP treatment multi-discipline measures are an important step.The basic principles of SAP treatment includes usually: a) emerging hospitalisation, b) monitoring of vital function, c) restriction of oral intake, d) adequate enteral and parenteral nutrition, e) adequate analgesic treatment, f) the emplacement of nasogastric tube, g) antibiotic treatment for infectious complications, h) percutaneous drainage, endoscopic therapy or abdominal laparotomy.The basic standard for diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis is contrast-enhanced computed -tomography.However, cross-sectional imaging in the early phase of evaluation is not associated with improved outcome, but is very important and usually used between 48-72 h after hospitalisation.Antibiotic treatment in SAP is still a controversial option and some studies recommend use of antibiotics agents only if the complications of sepsis are presented but not for their prevention [63][64][65] .In addition, broad spectrum antibiotics with good tissue penetration are necessary to prevent infection in SAP after CT-proven pancreatic necrosis 66 .Patients suffering from infected necrosis, massive hemorrhage, bowel perforation, sterile necrosis with clinical deterioration or symptomatic organized necrosis are usually indicated for surgical intervention 67 .
