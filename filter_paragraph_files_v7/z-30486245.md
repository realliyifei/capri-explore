## (s6) T Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity
Number of References: 3

(p6.0) Physiological cytotoxicity is mediated by CD8+ T cells because they bind to the class I MHC of all nucleated cells. Killing occurs either by a calcium-dependent secretory mechanism or a calcium-independent mechanism that requires direct contact [55]. The influx of calcium during the activation causes exocytosis of cytolytic granules containing a lytic protein called perforin and serine proteases granzymes. Perforin forms a defect in the target cell membrane allowing granzyme activity to lyse the cell. In the absence of calcium, cytotoxic T cells upregulate fas ligand upon activation, which can then bind to fas on the target cells, leading to apoptosis, which is a programmed cell death that involves fragmentation of nuclear contents [56,57].
