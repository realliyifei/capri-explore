## (s7) Phylogenetic analysis
Number of References: 2

(p7.0) Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the conserved catalytic domains of STKs rather than their whole sequences, as the additional domains with their possibly separate evolutionary histories might confuse the phylogeny. The STK catalytic domains, about 280 amino acids in length, were identified using SMART and CDD databases [27,44].

(p8.0) Ser/Thr protein kinases, members of signal transduction systems, play important roles in responses to the environmental changes and intra-cellular signals [29]. This may be vital for their host cyanobacteria, which originated 2.5-3.5 billion years ago and exhibit the widest range of diversity in growth habitats of all photosynthetic organisms. Some of these kinases have demonstrated, in at least one case, possibly essential roles, illustrated by Sll0776 (SpkD) in Synechocystis PCC6803 which could not be completely knocked out [30].
