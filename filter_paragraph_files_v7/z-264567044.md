(p9.0) Recently, research on adaptation trending as COVID-19 cases have become a global epidemic.Adaptation is an interesting issue because it is an action that produces two forms: positively or negatively affecting non-market factors, such as water quality, ecosystem function, human health, social organization, and cultural practices [21].Family is a determining factor in the ability of an individual to adapt (Table 2).Previous findings mention that childhood, in which individuals are still attached to their families and behave according to the wishes and formations of their families, integrate with the adaptation of someone at a later age and predict human adaptability [22].

(p12.0) The early months of 2020 marked the outbreak of the coronavirus, which dominated and changed the lives of everyone globally.Life changed instantly with learning from home, distancing from home, and working from home.As every rule has consequences, the new regulations passed by governments in some parts of the world created social uncertainty and fear [89].Fear is the emotion that arises when a human faces a real threat or perceives an obstacle.Some physiological symptoms, such as heart palpitations, stiff muscles, an increase in pulse rate, and other psychological symptoms in the form of a response to anger, avoidance, screaming, or even silence (Siddique, Ahmed, and Hossain, 2021).

(p12.1) No one knew when the pandemic would end; therefore, humans faced challenges in economic shocks and changes in social behavior [90].Currently, family adaptation required in a global context is a way for families to survive the COVID-19 pandemic.In the largest COVID-19-affected country globally, family adaptation significantly increases solidarity networks, strengthens relationships between family members both internally and externally, develops new technologies in family domestic work, opens communication relationships, and balances work patterns and family harmony [91] due to the increased flexibility of work during COVID-19 by working from home.
