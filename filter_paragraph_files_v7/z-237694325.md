## (s19) Anti-Weather-Exposure Ability
Number of References: 2

(p19.0) Anti-weather-exposure ability of GSP was tested by conserving samples in an exposing environment for 7 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 240 days. Its strength and fatigue life were shown no decline in Marshall stability test and cyclic wheel load test [115].
## (s25) Compressive Strength Prediction Model
Number of References: 2

(p25.0) Compressive strength of GSP is assessed by Cube compressive strength test. The values have a linear relationship with that of grouted hydrated cement mortar [137]. The expression is shown as below:
