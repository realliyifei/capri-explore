(p0.0) Machine learning is the study of how to train computers to do tasks like speech recognition, data analysis, computer vision, and natural language processing [1]. Rule-based and machine learning-based methodologies are the two main approaches used in the design of contemporary linguistic experiments and the development of natural language processing systems. e approaches that use supervised learning, or those that are based on manually created training data for learning, get the best results in practical applications of machine learning (ML). A system built on a hybrid method should produce better outcomes, according to what can be termed a general rule for the combining of these two approaches [2].
