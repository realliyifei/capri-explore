## (s3) Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

(p3.0) Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, autoimmune cholestatic disease causing fibro-inflammatory destruction of the intra-and/or extrahepatic bile ducts, often complicated by inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis [26]; although the disease course may be variable, in most cases it ultimately leads to biliary cirrhosis and liver dysfunction. In Europe and North America, the incidence rate of PSC ranges from 0.5 to 1.3 per 100,000 person-years, whereas in Asian countries this disease is less common [27]. In Western countries, PSC represents the most important risk factor for CCA, and patients with PSC carry a 400-fold higher risk of developing this malignancy compared to the general population [28]. The occurrence of CCA in these patients is higher in the first 2 years after PSC diagnosis, with 30-50% of CCAs developing within the first year [28].
## (s4) Hepatitis Virus Infection

(p4.0) Hepatitis viruses are well-known risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and worldwide approximately 56% and 20% of HCC cases are related to HBV and HCV infections, respectively [35]. Recent studies suggest that both HBV and HCV may also represent risk factors for CCA, particularly iCCA [36]. It seems that differences in HBV-and HCV-related CCA risk exist between Asian and Western populations. Indeed, while HBV infection represents a risk factor for CCA in some Asian countries such as China, where it is highly endemic, HCV-related CCAs mostly occur in Western countries and the United States [36]. The molecular mechanisms of HBV-and HCV-related CCA carcinogenesis still remain poorly understood, but it has been hypothesized that they may be similar to those driving HCC carcinogenesis, including a status of chronic inflammation due to the continuous presence of the virus in target tissues, and insertional mutagenesis in host cells of viral DNA, which can directly promote malignant transformation [37]. In HCC carcinogenesis, HBV-DNA insertion is an early event after viral infection and results in DNA damage and genomic instability in infected cells; furthermore, the integration sites of HBV-DNA are not random, but target specific loci of the tumor genome [38].
## (s6) Liver Cirrhosis

(p6.0) Cirrhosis represents the final stage of liver fibrosis and is characterized by profound changes in the hepatic architecture, with the formation of fibrous septae and regenerative nodules in response to chronic liver injury, which progressively leads to liver disfunction. Cirrhosis represent the main risk factor for HCC, but epidemiological studies have proven evidence that it also represents a risk factor for CCA, especially iCCA [53]. A recent largescale retrospective study on 1312 iCCA Asian patients reported that 23.0% of iCCA cases occurred on a cirrhotic liver, a much higher percentage than in Western countries [54]; furthermore, 90.1% of cirrhotic patients showed HBsAg positivity, indicating that liver cirrhosis is mostly associated with HBV infection in China [54].
