(p4.0) Chikusetsusaponin IVa are reported against SK-Hep-1 cells with IC 50 value of 18.9 mg/mL and it was comparable to that of cisplatin (IC 50 = 12.7 mg/mL) (Yoo, Kwon, & Park, 2006). Deglucose chikusetsusaponin IVa (DCIVa) inhibited cell growth of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and viability in a dose-and time-dependent manner using an MTT assay. DCIVa lead to chromatin condensation and margination at the nuclear periphery, and apoptotic body for-mation. Moreover, Hoechst 33,258 staining showed nuclear condensation and fragmentation. Furthermore, DCIVa increased cell apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest, in addition enhanced the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, and deceased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Song et al., 2015).

(p15.0) There are some commercial formulations in clinical trial. More and more clinical trial are being conducted recently, and metabolomics are used not only in plant but also the formulation (Xie et al., 2008;Yu, Mwesige, Yi, & Yoo, 2019).
