(p0.0) S chizophrenia is a common psychiatric disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 1% in general population and high financial and social costs 1 .The clinical manifestations are divided in positive symptoms (hallucination, delusion), negative symptoms (social withdrawal, lack of emotion) and cognitive decline (memory dysfunction), which are used in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, since there is no biomarker for the disease.The physiopathology of the disease is unknown, whereas several theories have emerged to explain its features: neurotransmitters dysfunction (several neurotransmitters have been related to schizophrenia, such as dopamine, serotonin, GABA and glutamate), neurodevelopment abnormalities, neurodegenerative disorder, accelerated aging syndrome, neuroinflammation disorder, among other described models 2,3,4 .

(p0.1) The oldest theory was elaborated in 19th-century by Kraepelin, who described the disease as "dementia praecox", since young patients progressively, deteriorated its cognitive functions while suffering from hallucinations 2 .This description approximates schizophrenia to clinical progression of known neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease, creating basis for the development of neurodegeneration hypothesis for schizophrenia 3 .Furthermore, some evidence showing enlargement of ventricles during disease-years, glutamate excitoxicity, oxidative damage and other chemical similarities with recognized degenerative processes support this theory.However some authors argument, as it occurred with Kraepelin afterwards, neurodegeneration model would not explain alone all the clinical features of schizophrenia, including why a subset of patients improve after treatment 2,3 .

(p0.2) The second theory elaborated was neurodevelopment.Despite it had been first proposed in 1873 by Thomas Clouston, who described clinical features of the "adolescent insanity", only in mid-1980 it resurged, with more robust evidence.Existence of premorbid stage, cranial-facial abnormalities, neuroimaging findings in first-episode patients, increased risk for the disease when obstetric and gestational complications support the theory of neural development disorder.This model, however, do not explain satisfactorily why the onset is during adolescence/young adults period and how a subgroup of patients recover after treatment.Detailing the development hypothesis was tried to address these problems, such as the neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion 2 , the progressive developmental disease 3 and the "two-hit" hypothesis 4 .

(p0.3) Lastly, neuroinflammation model surged more recently when, for example, Stevens introduced the idea of inflammatory markers in cerebral spinal fluid of schizophrenia patients and correlated this with the neuropathology 5 .The most substantial evidence for this hypothesis is the findings of statically significant MHC classes in three independent Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) 6 .Furthermore, a history of autoimmune disorders and maternal infections increase the risk of the disease; and, although inconsistent, some report activated microglia in schizophrenia brain samples 6 .
