## (s6) Enzymes involved in folate pathway
Number of References: 2

(p6.0) Empirical evidence also indicates that folate pathway is vital for synthesizing amino acids, as it is important for building of proteins for the malaria parasites survival.By referring to previous literatures regarding folate pathway, several drugs were developed to disrupt folate pathway with the aim of developing new treatment and prophylaxis for malaria.Folate pathway is also critical in providing cofactors for the metabolic events.The enzymes in this pathway serve as molecular targets, including dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS).DHFR aids in the oxidation of tetrahydrofolate (THF) molecule to DHF and its reconversion to the THF form (Hyde, 2005).DHPS is an enzyme with two binding pockets, one of which binds to dihydropterin pyrophosphate (DHPP), while the other binds with p-amino benzoic acid (pABA).DHPS catalyzes the reaction that produces 7,8dihydropteroate from these two substrates.Gardner et al., (2002).
