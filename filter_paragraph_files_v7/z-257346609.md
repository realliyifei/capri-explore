(p4.0) Support vector machines (SVM) are designed for binary classification in a multidimensional space. The working principle of SVM involves the identification of a hyperplane, a boundary that separates outcome categories to their full extent [18]. SVM applies a data transformation to the sample data and projects it to a desired dimensional space that is higher via a kernel function. A kernel function is defined as a function that returns the inner product (dot product) between the images of two data points (x, x') in the higherdimensional space. ML then takes place in this space [24]. An example of a dot product between x ij and x ij ' can be mathematically shown below:

(p6.0) Another ML technique is regression analysis, a conventional method used to determine the correlation between a dependent variable and one (univariate) or multiple (multivariate) independent variables [26,27]. Since the nature of the correlation between variables exists, there are multiple types of regression being designed to cater to these relationships. These regression techniques all attempt to achieve the same objective, which is to illustrate the variable of interest as a mathematical function of independent variables that affect its value. The most straightforward type is the simple linear regression (SLR) method, which aims to fit the data into a straight line that can be expressed as follows:
