Number of References: 2

(p2.0) FL is a transformative approach to distributed machine learning, enabling the collaborative training of models across multiple devices or clients while preserving data privacy [11]. Various FL architectures have been developed to address the diverse challenges and requirements in data distribution, communication patterns, and coordination methods. These architectures can be broadly classified into three main categories: data distribution-based architectures, such as Horizontal FL (HFL), Vertical FL (VFL), and Federated Transfer Learning (FTL); scale and communication-based architectures, including Cross-Silo FL (CSFL) and Cross-Device FL (CDFL); and coordination-based architectures, which encompass Centralized FL, Decentralized FL, and Hierarchical FL. Each of these architectures caters to specific needs and constraints, ensuring optimal model development across a wide range of applications while maintaining data privacy and security.

(p11.0) The authors proposes a new approach called Federated Stochastic Dual-Gate based Feature Selection (FedSDG-FS) [37] for feature selection in Vertical FL (VFL). Existing FS works for VFL assume prior knowledge on the number of noisy features or the threshold of useful features to be selected, making them unsuitable for practical applications. FedSDG-FS uses a Gaussian stochastic dual-gate to approximate the probability of a feature being selected with privacy protection through Partially Homomorphic Encryption without a trusted third-party. It also proposes a feature importance initialization method based on Gini impurity to reduce overhead. Experiments show that FedSDG-FS outperforms existing approaches in selecting high-quality features and building global models with higher performance. The proposed method solves the problem of efficient feature selection in VF.

(p11.1) A trustworthiness evaluation framework, TrustE-VC, is proposed in [38] that combines criteria importance and performance rates to determine the service attributes of vertical FL that require more attention. It also suggests a three-level security feature to enhance effectiveness and trustworthiness in VC. The proposed framework comprises three interconnected components, including an aggregation of the security evaluation values, a fuzzy multicriteria decision-making algorithm, and a simple additive weight associated with importanceperformance analysis and performance rate to visualize the framework findings. The proposed framework provides a useful tool for designers and industrial CV practices to evaluate and select industrial CV trust requirements. The framework addresses the challenges of developing effective and trustworthy VFL models.

(p13.0) In FL, it is crucial to evaluate the contributions of participants to the performance of the final model while ensuring privacy. To achieve this, the widely adopted method is the use of Shapley Value (SV) techniques. However, existing SV-based approaches are computationally expensive and impractical for real-world applications. To tackle this issue, authors in [45] introduced the Guided Truncation Gradient Kapley (GTG-Shapley) approach, which reduces the computation cost of SVbased FL participant contribution evaluation. Unlike traditional methods, GTG-Shapley does not require extra learning tasks from participants, as it reconstructs FL sub-models using their previous gradient updates instead of training them from scratch. Additionally, GTG-Shapley employs guided Monte Carlo sampling to further reduce the number of required model reconstructions and evaluations, thereby enhancing the efficiency of SV computation. GTG-Shapley offers a more practical and scalable solution for fair FL participant contribution evaluation. GTG-Shapley enables FL to be more practical and widely adopted in real-world applications.

(p13.1) The aggregation of local models from participating clients is a critical component in generating the final global model in FL. However, traditional aggregation methods can be susceptible to adversarial attacks and client failures. To mitigate this issue, the authors of this paper propose a truth inference approach to FL that incorporates the reliability of each client's local model into the aggregation process. The proposed approach in [46] models the clients' reliability based on their submitted local model parameters and considers these parameters during the aggregation process to produce a robust estimate of the global model. The authors have further enhanced the method by considering the model parameters submitted by clients in previous rounds in addition to the current round, thus providing a more comprehensive evaluation of client reliability.The proposed truth inference approach provides a more robust estimate of the global model, protects against potential adversarial attacks, and considers client reliability in the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of FL.
## (s17) B. Trustworthy Contribution Evaluation
Number of References: 2

(p17.0) The contribution measurement strategies used in FL systems can be classified into three main categories: self-report based evaluation, Shapley value based evaluation, and influence and reputation based evaluation. Self-report based evaluation involves the data owner directly reporting their level of contribution to the model owner. Metrics used to evaluate the contribution include computational resources and data size. The Shapley value based evaluation takes into account the participation order of the data owners and assesses their contributions in a fair manner, typically used in cooperative games. Influence and reputation based evaluation considers the client's impact on the FL model's loss function and their reliability, and may involve techniques like Fed-Influence and reputation mechanisms that can be combined with blockchain. A client's reputation is generally a combination of their internal reputation in a task and their accumulated reputation based on historical records. The authors in [89] focuses on the critical aspect of measuring the contributions of users in FL systems. The authors conduct a comprehensive analysis of the different strategies for evaluating user contributions, examining the factors that can impact the effectiveness of these methods. The paper emphasizes the need for fair and accurate evaluation techniques to assess the contributions of data owners in FL and provides valuable insights into the current state of research in this area. This study highlights the importance of considering user contributions in FL systems and provides a solid foundation for future research in this field. The categorization and most relevant research work are presented in following sub sections.
