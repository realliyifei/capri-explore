## (s4) Variation Across the Day in Hunger and Satiety Hormones may Impact Weight Regulation
Number of References: 3

(p4.0) Appetite regulating hormones ghrelin and leptin exhibit daily rhythms of synthesis and secretion [39]. Leptin, secreted from white adipocytes, is implicated in the regulation of hunger, food intake and energy balance, while ghrelin stimulates appetite, fat production, and body growth-leading to increased food intake and body weight. The circulating level of ghrelin is mainly regulated by nutritional status, rising by fasting and decreasing after food ingestion [40]. The circadian peak in ratings of hunger occurs in the biological evening, and the circadian trough in hunger ratings occurs in the biological morning [41] corresponding with ghrelin levels being elevated at night.
