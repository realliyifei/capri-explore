## (s3) Factors that affect the probiotics survival in yogurt
Number of References: 4

(p3.0) Yogurt is a fermented milk-based product that increasingly receives the addition of probiotic bacteria to improve its quality and nutritional value, increasing its beneficial impacts on health (Aryana & Olson, 2017). This effect of probiotics is due to dairy fermentation, which plays a role in aiding milk preservation by generating lactic acid, antimicrobial compounds, desirable flavor compounds, and other metabolites (Fazilah, Ariff, Khayat, Rios-Solis, & Halim, 2018).
## (s7) Low frequency and high-intensity ultrasound
Number of References: 2

(p7.0) A promising new technology reported in the literature to improve the viability of probiotics is low-frequency, highintensity ultrasound, which has great potential for a wide variety of applications in dairy processing (Bhargava, Mor, Kumar, & Sharanagat, 2020).
## (s8) Use of prebiotics
Number of References: 4

(p8.0) Currently, scientific studies on the effect of prebiotics on the acidification rate and viability of probiotic bacteria during the manufacture and refrigerated storage of yogurts are being discussed (Delgado-Fernández, Corzo, Olano, Hernández-Hernández, & Moreno, 2019). Due to their technological characteristics, some prebiotics can lead to improvements in the quality of products regarding sensory properties, texture, and physicochemical characteristics, in the addition of fibers and the partial replacement of sugars and fats (Xavier-Santos, Bedani, Perego, Converti, & Saad, 2019).

(p8.1) Prebiotics falls into a category of functional foods and can be defined as non-digestible food ingredients classified as soluble fiber, which beneficially affect their host by selectively stimulating the growth and activity of bacteria in the colon, thus improving the health of the host, In yogurt, the prebiotic acts as a substrate for the growth of probiotic bacteria and, consequently, improves gastrointestinal functions and the immune system (Fazilah, Ariff, Khayat, Rios-Solis, & Halim, 2018).
