Number of References: 3

(p13.0) Details on the dissemination of cohort findings were scarce in the included traditional cohort publications. Dissemination seems to be focused on scientific publications, which, if added to the lengthy data collection and analysis completion periods, seems to have a rather delayed character. Nonetheless, traditional cohorts may have dedicated websites through which publications and key findings can be retrieved. A further element that could be described as integral to the dissemination strategy of traditional cohorts is the use of findings for the development and dissemination of clinical tools such as risk prediction scores [18,23,25].
