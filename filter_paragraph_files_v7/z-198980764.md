(p4.0) One approach to biohybrid robotics described in the literature is to use engineered tissues as part of the machine [119,120]. In this review focused on construction as application, we review robots that influence intact organisms, as we are interested in their behaviours of depositing or growing building material. Robotics that incorporate biological organisms can have any of the following interaction types:

(p29.0) Technically speaking, self-organization can be understood as the distribution of control of a system over a considerable set of its components [270]. This immediately applies to systems comprised of autonomously acting agents, as each of those follows its own agenda. Thus, biological systems are 0.2 mm 0.2 mm inherently self-organizing. When designing technological systems, one also has to consider that large systems that have to work flexibly and be robust to local failures and changes in the environment, can only be realized if individual components may act autonomously-otherwise, the managerial overhead, the communication overhead and the risk of single points of failure do not allow scaling up of the number of involved components or subsystems [271].
