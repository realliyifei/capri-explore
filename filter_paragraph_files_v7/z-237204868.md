## (s7) Remediation of soils contaminated with heavy metals -cadmium and arsenic
Number of References: 2

(p7.0) Due to the high content of functional groups containing oxygen, HSs are an effective material used for the remediation of soils contaminated with heavy metals. Examples of such metals are Cd and As, the difficulty of their simultaneous removal is caused by the opposite chemical behaviours of these elements. It is important to adjust the washing conditions to the soil properties. Important factors are the pH value, the duration and cycles of washing and the HSs concentration (Bi, Yuan, Wei, Xiao, Feng, Meng and Wang, 2019). The content of Cd and As in soil can be a serious problem in specific places, as is the case in China. A national survey showed that the national standards were exceeded in 7% and 2.7% of the sampling sites for Cd and As, respectively. Cd and As are toxic and carcinogenic elements -their presence in soil poses a threat to the quality of the environment and human health and has a negative effect on food. Therefore, it is so important to minimise the risk by removing these elements from the soil (Bi et. al., 2019).
