## (s10) Local convex hull (LoCoH) or k-nearest neighbor convex hulls (k-NNCH)
Number of References: 3

(p10.0) This is a localized version of the MCP.For a fixed integer k > 0, Getz and Wilmers (2004) construct the convex hull, k-NNCH i , of each sample point x i and its k âˆ’ 1 nearest neighbors (NN) (with respect to the Euclidean metric, although other metrics could be employed).Then these hulls are ordered according to their area, from smallest to largest.The LoCoH home range estimate is the isopleth that results of progressively taking the union of the hulls from the smallest upwards, until a specific percentage (e.g., 95%) of sample points is included.Getz et al. (2007) extend the original LoCoH procedure (called k-LoCoH) to the r-LoCoH (where a fixed sphere of influence was used instead of the k nearest neighbours) and to the a-LoCoH (the a standing for adaptive sphere of influence).A detailed study of the theoretical properties and finite sample performance of the r-LoCoH can be found in Aaron and Bodart (2016).
