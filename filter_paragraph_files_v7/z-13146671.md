(p0.0) The incidence and diversity of tick-borne infections in humans and animals have increased in recent years due to several factors. These factors include the existence of better diagnostic tools; increased awareness among the scientific community, veterinarians, physicians and public health authorities; increased contact of humans with wildlife and vectors (urbanization and habitat encroachment); and changes in the environment, such as global climate change [1,2]. These factors have increased the probabilities of contact with ticks and/or sylvatic reservoir hosts [3].
