(p3.0) In terms of studies that focused on the effects of human aspects on the RE process in particular, [24] and [36] focused on effective communication as a critical success factor during requirements elicitation. However these studies were limited to global software development (GSD) and identified that effective communication plays a significant role in requirements elicitation specifically for GSD teams. It was found that geographical distribution, time zone, cultural diversity and physical differences were reasons for miscommunication when conducting requirements elicitation in GSD. Their analysis also indicates that lack of effective communication, lack of knowledge sharing and awareness, lack of collaboration and organizational change are common critical challenges related to the RE process in GSD. Khan and Akbar [37] performed an SLR and an empirical investigation on motivation factors for the requirements change management process in GSD. They explored the motivators that contribute to requirements change management by extracting 25 motivators, and developed taxonomies of identified motivators such as accountability, clear change management strategy, overseas site's response, and effective change management leadership.
