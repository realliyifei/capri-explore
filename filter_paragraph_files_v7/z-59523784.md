(p3.0) In [1][2][3], the authors have analyzed the ability of some of the most common numerical methods for SDEs in preserving the correlation matrix over long times.The analysis given in [1,2] only involves one-step methods, while that provided in [3] is focused on the larger class of indirect two-step methods (ITS methods), i.e., the family of stochastic two-step methods applied to the first order representation given by Equation (2) of the second order SDE in Equation (1).ITS methods assume the form
