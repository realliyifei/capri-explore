(p0.0) Water is at the basis of social and economic development; it is vital to every human being; it is essential for growing food, health, and safety. Moreover, water is related to the economic vitality of our society, and, at present, there is no substitute for water on the earth's crust. Water has a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) that is dedicated exclusively to its promotion (Goal 6, "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all"), and it has a crucial role in a good number of the SDGs while forming an essential factor in others. Nevertheless, due to the effects of climate change, which are being felt right now [1], water is becoming a more scarce and less predictably available resource in many world regions [2]. Water scarcity is among the principal problems that many societies and the entire world will face during the XXI century, and it is already affecting every continent.
