(p2.0) This systematic literature review aims to reveal trends within its research area [31]. More specifically, this review aims to synthesize the state of the art of motivational technologies in transportation safety, including publication details, transportation facets, safety improvement measures, types of motivational interventions, applied research methodologies and motivational technology effects. To achieve this, the methodology employed includes search conduction, studies screening, and data extraction.

(p6.0) The reviewed studies indicate the motivational technologies potential for enhancing transportation safety by promoting psychological and behavioral change. However, there are limitations and shortcomings to overcome, many of which relate to the motivational technologies research legacy, such as the lack of comprehensive theory-driven designs and evaluation of the effects of individual affordances as well as the incomplete descriptions of interventions [14,28]. Additional thematic and methodological gaps and corresponding future research directions are further discussed below.
