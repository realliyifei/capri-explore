## (s9) Big data as prerequisite for integrating AI in mobile networks
Number of References: 4

(p9.0) The integration of intelligent algorithms and learning approaches requires the availability of big data sets, which represent the starting point. However, because the AI and ML can be integrated at different levels of the next generation mobile work, or at least in 5G, different big data sources can be explored and must be selected carefully to be able to extract as much as possible of knowledge/learning. Different ways are proposed in the literature to classify the needed types of big data sets, which should build the basis for the AI and ML, such the ones proposed in [10][11][12]. For example, a classification of different big data sources is illustrated in Figure 5, which contains three pools of big data sets: general wireless data, social network-aware data, social data and cloud data [11].
