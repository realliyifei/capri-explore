(p9.0) Patients with active disease (BASDAI > 4) had significantly lower proximal femur BMD compared to patients with inactive disease, whereas spinal BMD was similar in the study by Kaya et al [31] . After 24-mo of follow-up lumbar spinal BMD increased in both groups; however hip BMD decreased in the inactive group [31] .
