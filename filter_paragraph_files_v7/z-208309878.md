(p0.0) Since the rise of deep learning in the last decade, many different libraries and frameworks for running and training deep neural networks (DNN) have been published and opensourced. In that time, the landscape of software tools for training neural networks has moved from difficult-to-install libraries [1], and support for static graphs only [2], to industryready, easy-to-deploy frameworks [3], high-development efficiency [4], and support for dynamic graphs and just-intime compilation [5]. Recently, as tools have gained maturity, more businesses have started using neural networks in production and exposing services based on neural networks [6]. Deploying neural networks is non-trivial, and the research frameworks proved insufficient to handle high-bandwidth, lowlatency inference, leading to the development of productionready frameworks such as Tensorflow Serving [7] and the standardization of neural network formats with ONNX [8].
