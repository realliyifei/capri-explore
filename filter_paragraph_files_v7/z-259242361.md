(p0.0) The discovery of antibiotics in the 20th century was a milestone in the history of medicine and healthcare. However, bacteria are constantly evolving, and have been developing resistance mechanisms against virtually all available antibiotics [1]. In order to uniformize the definitions associated with multi-resistance, a joint initiative from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined the resistance profile of bacteria classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and pandrug-resistant (PDR); the standardized definitions and associated resistance profiles were elaborated for bacteria highly prone to develop resistance and frequently responsible for infections in the healthcare system [2].

(p19.0) All of 37 and 32 isolates tested were classified as susceptible to cefiderocol, respectively, in two studies. [71,72] Only 1 out of 1158 isolates of M. morganii was classified as cefiderocol-resistant in this study. [49] Proteus spp.
