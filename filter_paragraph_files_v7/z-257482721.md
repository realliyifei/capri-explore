## (s13) Classification of BC
Number of References: 3

(p13.0) Based on the data management, the can be classified into three main classes: Public, Private, and Consortium [19][20] [21]. The public BC (Permissionless) is completely open and anyone can join and participate in the network. Some public BC limit access to just reading or writing. Bitcoin is one of the public BlockChain examples that permission to join it uses an approach where anyone can write. The second class is Private BC (Permission), which is not open to anyone and the participant needs permission to join it, because there is a restriction on who is allowed to participate in the network. This type of BC is used between companies that belong to the same legal mother entity [22]. Finally, the Consortium BC (Hybrid), which is would be a mix of both the public and private BC. Wherein the ability to read and write could be extended to a certain number of people or nodes. This could be used by groups of organizations or firms, who get together, work on developing different models by collaborating with each other. Who is allowed to participate in the network?
