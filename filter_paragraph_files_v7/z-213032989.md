(p16.0) Most studies indicated plasma H 2 S levels decreased in diabetic patients. Compared with lean subjects, overweight and type 2 diabetes patients had decreased blood H 2 S concentrations. The median plasma H 2 S levels (25th, 75th percentiles) in lean, overweight and type 2 diabetes subjects were 38.9 (29.7, 45.1) lmol/L, 22.0 (18.6, 26.7) lmol/L and 10.5 (4.8, 22.0) lmol/L, respectively [12].
