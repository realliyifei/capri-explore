(p0.0) Over the recent years, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi) has improved the management and prognosis of many solid tumors. 1 These drugs are monoclonal antibodies that block immune checkpoints that are present on the surface of T-cells to ensure immune self-tolerance, resulting in an increase of the T-cells ability to attack the cancer cells 2 (Figures 1 and 2).

(p0.1) Currently, seven ICPi are approved for the treatment of different solid tumors: a cytotoxic T-lymphocytes associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor Ipilimumab; 3 three programmed cell death protein (PD-1) inhibitors: Nivolumab, 4 Pembrolizumab 5 and Cemiplimab; 6 and three programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors: Atezolizumab, 7 Avelumab 8 and Durvalumab. 9 Table 1 summarizes the different ICPi and their clinical indications.
