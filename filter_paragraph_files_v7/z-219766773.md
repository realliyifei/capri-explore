(p2.0) Sea-level rise is the greatest potential threat of climate change that not only will affect millions of people but also mangrove ecosystems [22]. Recent study using Coastal DEM indicates that under high emissions, 630 million people will be living on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100 [23]. This study also reports that 70% of the total people worldwide living in China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan, would be exposed to sea-level rise and annual storm surges [23].
