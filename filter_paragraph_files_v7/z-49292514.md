(p4.0) Fluorescence spectroscopy is the most popular technique in the field of biology and medicine, which leads people to the microcosmic world of bio-medicine. The theoretical basis for FRET is a nonradiative energy transfer between two fluorescent molecules (D and A, whose excitation spectra are partially overlapped) that are located close to each other (less than 10 nm) [79][80][81]. FRET can  be used to study receptor-ligand interactions, affinity constants, receptor dimerization, and so on [82][83][84].
