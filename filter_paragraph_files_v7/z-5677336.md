## (s3) Peptide-Toxin Structure

(p3.0) KCN scorpion toxins vary in length from 23 to 64 AAs with estimated molecular weights usually less than 4000 Da. As highly constrained polypeptides they adhere to either the inhibitor cysteine knot or disulfide-directed Î²-hairpin folding motif [35]. Extensive research was required in initial toxin studies to determine primary AA sequence, pharmacological target and establish three-dimensional structure. Proteolytic enzymes have been used to assist in defining critical disulfide bridging, with Edman degradation providing the location of these bonding pairs-a major undertaking with any multiple-disulfide bond-containing constituent. This was only possible once purified target materials were available, as achieved by paper and/or column chromatography [36].
## (s24) Mokatoxin-1
Number of References: 2

(p24.0) Using a scaffold-based/target-biased strategy developed by Takacs et al. (2009), a phage display was used to design and identify a synthetic peptide, Mokatoxin-1 (moka1), that is highly specific for K V 1.3 [72]. Block of K V 1.3 in T-cells counters the effects of anti-CD3/28 stimulation and suppresses effector cytokine secretion without cross-reactive gastrointestinal hyperactivity (side effects). Other scorpion toxins have been isolated which block K V 1.3 (i.e., KTX), however due to lack of channel specificity (KTX also blocks K V 1.1 and K V 1.2), undesirable side effects are produced (i.e., diarrhea).
