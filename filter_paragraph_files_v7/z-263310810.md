(p11.0) In this section, we show a concrete example of classification of orbits in a double flag variety by using quiver representations. Thus we focus on the category of quiver representations J (a, b, c) and the double flag variety X((a ′ , b ′ ); c) of type AIII (cf. [FN20,FN23]). We summarize the notation which will be used below:
