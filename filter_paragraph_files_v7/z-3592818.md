(p20.0) Polymorphisms associated with the actions of caffeine might influence the efficacy of GTE -caffeine mixtures.Caffeine is metabolised by cytochrome P450 1A2, coded for by the CYP1A2 gene, while the stimulatory actions of caffeine are mediated at the adenosine A2A receptor coded for by the ADORA2A gene.The latter gene is known to be associated with caffeine intake, depending on the allele present (TT or C).Those with the ADORA2A TT genotype were more likely to be associated with a lower caffeine intake than the C genotype, and may be more sensitive to low doses of caffeine than to high doses (84,85) .Such variation between populations might influence the biological activity of GTE -caffeine mixtures.

(p20.1) Polymorphisms in the genes coding for COMT have also been shown to demonstrate variation across different ethnicities (86) .Different alleles code for two different versions of the COMT enzyme based on a Val-Met mutation.The Valcontaining allele produces a high-activity isoform (COMT-H), and the Met allele, a thermolabile, low-activity form (COMT-L).Palmatier et al. (86) demonstrated variation of the combination of the alleles on a global scale, with Caucasian populations possessing almost equal proportions of the two, leading to a moderate level of enzymatic activity.Asian populations, however, showed a higher proportion of the Val allele, and thus a higher level of COMT activity.This might explain the differences noted by Hursel et al. (84) , between ethnic groups, as the Val to Met substitution has been known to reduce COMT activity by up to a factor of 4. Thus, inhibiting a low-activity enzyme as in the Caucasian population would not result in a significant effect on fat metabolism, while inhibiting a high-activity enzyme in the Asian population would.

(p21.0) Work by Hursel et al. (84) investigated any potential synergy between a Green tea -caffeine mixture with a high-protein diet on weight maintenance after a weight-loss period (87) .Such a context is particularly common in those who undertake weight training regimens with a view to increasing fat-free mass, and preventing significant fat mass regain, during a fat-loss programme.
