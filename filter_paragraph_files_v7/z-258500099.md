## (s13) Might Modifications of TiO 2 -NPs Surface Decrease Phototoxicity?
Number of References: 3

(p13.0) The widespread potential use of TiO 2 in medicine and cosmetics has led researchers to try to reduce phototoxicity by modifying the particles surface. Most of the modifications involve the introduction of an inert shell on the surface of the NPs. Among the materials used for coating, the most common are silica (SiO 2 ), alumina (Al 2 O 3 ), zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2 ), or siloxanes [36]. However, the main challenge in synthesizing these types of particles with decreased phototoxicity is to suppress the photoactivity with preserved UV-shielding ability. Moreover, due to the potential application of these particles, the shell must be built of inert materials, the role of which is to inhibit the formation of ROS or to scavenge ROS. However, to date, there is no evidence that this method leads to a complete deactivation of the catalytic activity of TiO 2 -NPs [36,73].
