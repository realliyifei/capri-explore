(p0.0) Sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and cachexia all share a common phenotype: relative reductions in the amount, composition, and function of skeletal muscle [1]. Although often the largest compartment at the tissue-organ level of body composition [2], quantifying the total mass and composition of skeletal muscle in living subjects proved remarkably difficult over the past century compared to fat, bone mineral, body fluids, and other relatively large compartments of clinical interest.

(p2.0) Just after the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy, Jindřich Matiegka, working at the University of Prague a few years after World War I, communicated his body composition vision in a May 7, 1920 letter to the prominent US physical anthropologist Aleš Hrdlička: "I shall send my proposal for establishing a commission that would work out a method for assessing work efficiency of the human body. I justify my proposal by pointing out that it is a duty of anthropology to develop a method for testing human physical capacity, similar to the methods worked out by psychologists to test mental capacity. Mental and physical capacities together constitute the working capacity and determine the working efficiency of the person" [14]. A year later, Matiegka published what is likely the seminal paper describing anthropometric measurement of skeletal muscle mass and three other functional body compartments [15]. Matiegka's system considered body weight (W) the sum of four components,
