## (s10) Coalescence of Drops in Hele-Shaw Cells
Number of References: 3

(p10.0) For studies of drops coalescence occurring between two parallel surfaces, a Hele-Shaw cell was used.The Hele-Shaw cell consists of two parallel surfaces with a cell depth (D) that is much smaller than the drop radius (i.e., D << R).Behaviors of drops in such a confining geometry are relevant to various applications in which a small amount of liquid is manipulated, such as microfluidics [23].In addition, the flow velocity in the depth-wise direction is negligibly small compared to the velocity components in the other directions, which enables assuming quasi 2D flow [38].Another advantage of using Hele-Shaw cells is that the geometry of drops is symmetric with respect to the mid-plane of drops.It needs to be pointed out that in the studies summarized in this section, drops did not make a direct contact with the wall of Hele-Shaw cells.Instead, a thin layer of the outer liquid existed between the drop and the wall [8].Thus, these studies belong to the two-phase coalescence with two confining surfaces category and involved neither contact line dynamics nor surface wettability.
