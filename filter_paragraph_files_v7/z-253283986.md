(p1.0) Additive Manufacturing (AM) can be defined as an automated process based on the layered manufacturing of a three-dimensional object from a geometric model developed using a CAD (Computer Aided Design) system ALHUMAYANI et al., 2020). Other terminologies such as Rapid Prototyping, Direct Digital Manufacturing, Solid Freeform Manufacturing, and 3D Printing (currently the most widespread), describe the same family of AM technology, producing its structures by adding materials, as opposed to traditional subtractive and formative methods, founded on the removal and molding of its components (ABDULHAMEED et al., 2019;AL RASHID et al., 2020;BUSWELL et al., 2007).
