## (s4) Mineral Saturation States and Nucleation
Number of References: 2

(p4.0) A mineral nucleates from solution if the mineral saturation state is above the equilibrium (saturated) value. The equilibrium saturation value at a given temperature is also termed the ''solubility product'' and is reported as K sp for pure minerals. The mineral saturation state is proportional to the activities of its component ions, raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients (ion activity product [IAP] [63]). If the IAP is larger than the mineral K sp , the solution is ''supersaturated'' with respect to that mineral.
