## (s1) PIK3CA mutations in ER1 BC

(p1.0) The most common PI3K pathway alteration in ERþ BC is PIK3CA oncogenic mutations, while PIK3CA gene amplification in the absence of mutation is relatively rare [3]. PIK3CA mutations are present in up to 40% of ERþ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative primary and metastatic tumors and result in constitutive enzymatic activity [4][5][6]. Many retrospective studies, including a large meta-analysis of >10 000 patients with early-stage BC [7], have proposed that PIK3CA mutations are prognostic markers for improved relapse-free survival on univariate analysis [8,9]. However, these studies have also confirmed that, when controlling for additional favorable-risk clinical variables such as ER positivity and receipt of hormonal therapy alone without chemotherapy, PIK3CA mutations are not prognostic for improved relapse-free survival or overall survival [7,8]. A study in HER2-positive (HER2þ) BC has found that PIK3CA mutations predict for decreased overall survival [7], suggesting additivity between upstream RTK signaling and PIK3CA mutation, and this has provided the preclinical rationale for investigating combination anti-HER2 therapy with PI3K pathway inhibition [10].

(p2.0) Upstream RTKs overexpression or mutations can hyperactivate their downstream signaling pathways including PI3K. ERBB2 amplification/HER2 overexpression is found in 10% of ERþ BCs [16], and rare HER2 mutations associated with endocrine resistance have also been characterized [17,18]. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification is found in up to 12% of ERþ BCs [19]. There are multiple direct and indirect mechanisms of interactions between upstream RTKs and the PI3K pathway, rationalizing combination therapies of PI3K inhibitors with RTK inhibitors. Mutations in Ras, which is also upstream of PI3K, are infrequent in BC (<1%, TCGA), though loss of negative regulators of Ras have been reported in luminal B tumors [20].  Figure 1. Signaling by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is activated by various growth factor receptors such as HER2, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), insulin-like growth factor 1 R (IGF1R) among others. PI3K proteins are recruited to the plasma membrane, leading to phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits to the membrane the AKT kinases that, once activated by PDK1 and mTORC2 phosphorylation, are able to phosphorylate TSC2 and negatively regulate the activity of the kinase mTOR. mTORC1 also phosphorylates and activates S6K. Also shown are few examples of PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors in clinical trials.

(p2.1) De novo PTEN mutations are rare in ERþ BC and are mutually exclusive with PIK3CA mutations in treatment naive breast tumors [21,22]; however, proteomic approaches have shown decreased PTEN protein in breast tumors irrespective of PIK3CA mutations, suggesting additional regulatory mechanisms of PTEN. In a meta-analysis, PTEN protein loss by immunohistochemistry is prognostic for decreased survival across all receptor subtypes of BC [23], but given that is highly associated with ER-BC, its prognostic significance has not been elucidated in ERþ BC. However, as discussed below, acquired PTEN mutation is a mechanism of resistance to PI3Ka inhibitors in ERþ PIK3CA mutant BC [24].

(p2.2) AKT mutant isoforms are considered weak oncogenes, where AKT1 E17K hotspot mutations are found in 3% of ERþ BC [22] and are mutually exclusive with PIK3CA mutations in early-stage [22] and metastatic ERþ BC [6]. On the other hand, AKT2 and AKT3 can be amplified but are rarely mutated in ERþ BC [22].
## (s3) Preclinical mechanisms of resistance to PI3K inhibitors

(p3.0) Initial studies on PI3K inhibitor resistance focused on RTK pathway upregulation [26] through expression and activation of HER2, HER3, and other RTKs in ERþ BC [27][28][29]. These RTKs re-stimulate PI3K by binding to the nSH2 and cSH2 (Src homology 2) domains of p85a, relieving its inhibition of p110a. Multiple adaptive and acquired resistance mechanisms to PI3K inhibitors have now been described. These can occur directly in the canonical effectors of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR cascade or involve parallel pathways that feed into the PI3K effectors at proximal or distal points.
