Number of References: 2

(p23.0) To assess the reporting quality of the included SRs, we used the PRISMA 2020 checklist (22). Figure 3 shows the reporting quality assessment results of the included SRs. Item 1 (title), item 2 (abstract), item 4 (objects), item 8 (selection process), item 19 (results of individual studies), item 20 (results of syntheses), and item 21 (reporting biases) were reported adequately (100%). Item 15 (describe any methods used to assess certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence for an outcome), item 22 (certainty of evidence), and item 24 (registration and protocol) of results reported insufficient description. Overall, two SRs (12,34) exhibited over 85% compliance. The results are shown in Supplementary 5.
