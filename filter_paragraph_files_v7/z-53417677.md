(p8.0) Some related works to the current overview are summarized in the following points: 1) Som et al. [7]Proposed a non-adaptive scheme based on chaos. They first decomposed the gray scale images to their equivalent 8-bitplanes, then encrypt the bit planes using couple tent map binary number generator (PRBNG) the four significant bit planes are determined by the level of significance for each pixel value and encrypted using a key obtained by applying the recurrence relation of tent map based on couple tent map binary number generator (PRBNG) the significant bit planes are then combined to produce the cipher image. 2) Parameshachari et al. [9]presented a novel algorithm for partial image encryption using combined phase modulation and sign encryption. (FT) is applied to the input image to get the phase and magnitude, then the image phase is scrambled using sign encryption that extracts sign bits to obtain partially encrypted image. 3) Kekre et al. [8] introduced a scheme for partial image encryption that the input image is partitioned in to four components (LL, HL, LH,HH) using sinusoidal wavelet transform, LL,LH and HH are then scrambled using Walsh sequency and the result is partially encrypted image, while the HL sub-band is neglected.
