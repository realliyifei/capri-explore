## (s2) Amyloid precursor protein trafficking
Number of References: 2

(p2.0) Amyloid precursor protein is biosynthesized in endoplasmic reticulum and anterogradely transported to the Golgi apparatus and then to the trans-Golgi network in distinct transport vesicles by conventional kinesin. In the trans-Golgi network APP undergoes various posttranslational modifications (phosphorylations, tyrosine sulfations and N-and O-glycosylations). Recently, calsyntenin-1 has been shown to be co-transported with APP along axons [69]. Calsyntenin-1 brain cellular level is reduced in persons with Alzheimer's disease and the extent of calsyntenin-1 reduction correlates with increased AÎ² levels. GTPase activity of Rab3, a small G-protein of the Rab family that is involved in the late steps of exocytosis, is required for APP transport vesicles [65].
