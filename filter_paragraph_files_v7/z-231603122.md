(p0.0) The movie 'The Social Dilemma' by Jeff Orlowski (2020) explores the rise of social media and the damage it has caused to society. With a rather negative connotation, the directors address the topic of digital platforms and how their users are influenced and persuaded in surveillance capitalism (Economist 2019). Persuasion is an activity that involves one party, the persuader , trying to induce another party, the persuadee , to believe or disbelieve something or to do something (Iyer & Sycara 2019). The Economist (2019) claims that as a central tenet of surveillance capitalism, and persuasion is, furthermore, important in many aspects of daily life. Consider, for example, an employee demanding an increase in compensation, a physician trying to get a patient to enter a slimming programme, a charity volunteer trying to raise funds for a school project (Hunter et al. 2019), or a government advisor trying to get people to take a vaccination in the midst of a pandemic for the greater good.
## (s10) Tools & Datasets
Number of References: 3

(p10.0) In the analyzed academic studies, we found that the authors use different datasets and tools to computationally process data for technical analyses of persuasion in NLP or NLG (e.g., in Guerini et al 2008a/b, Li et al. 2020, Iyer/Sycara 2019. Logically, the implementation of a persuasive NLG AI also depends on a variety of relevant tools and datasets which we identified and consolidated in Table 6. This table classifies our findings in types which are either tool or datasets (column one). We identified six tools and seventeen persuasion or message datasets. A software tool that is used in the context of persuasion and NLP, and datasets were chosen if they were used in the context of persuasion, textual exchange/debate and NLP. We further added a synopsis (column three) explaining every tool and Authority Appealing or making reference to higher authority or experts to persuade.
