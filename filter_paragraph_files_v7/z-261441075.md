(p15.0) As with voluntary quarantine of close contacts, case isolation at home was shown to be effective in suppressing transmission of COVID-19 (20,22,23,27,28,35,36).However, the effectiveness of this measure has been questioned with increasing evidence of natural immunity and disease resistance.

(p15.1) The two studies that analyzed the impact of the public transport closure did not show any significant difference in the progression of the epidemiological curve associated with this measure (21,23).This may have been due to other measures already implemented during the studied time periods (resulting in low public transport congestion and face masks worn on public transport).One of the studies included an analysis of 12 papers, of which only one found an association between public transport closures and the reproduction number, growth rate, or case-related outcomes of COVID-19 (23).
