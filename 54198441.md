## INTRODUCTION

The significance of cloud computing is increasing and is getting a rising attention in the scientific and industrial communities.Cloud computing is considered as the first among the top 10 most vital technologies and with a better view in consecutive years by companies and organizations by studying of Gartner.cloud allows ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that could be rapidly provisioned and released with negligible management effort or service provider interaction.It seems as a computational model as well as distribution architecture (Hashizume et al., 2013).

Customers of cloud can use computational resources which are including software, storage and processing capacities belonging to other companies (cloud service providers).Cloud services comprise Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) as shown in Fig. 1.

Amazon, Google and Microsoft are Great companies that are providing cloud services in numerous forms.Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivers cloud services that include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Simple Storage Service (S3).Google offers Platform as a Service (PaaS) known as Google App Engine (GAE) and eases hosting web applications (+Sun™ Storage J4200/J4400 Array System Overview).Microsoft also offers cloud services in the form of Windows Azure, SQL Azure, Windows Intune etc. Clients can use the advantage of mass storage and processing capacity at a low cost by depending on services.These services can be used by developers to evade the form overhead cost of buying resources, e.g., processors and storage devices (Dev et al., 2012).

Five essential characteristics are summarized by the cloud security alliance (Kumar et al., 2013) that exemplify the relation to and changes from, traditional computing model:

On-demand self-service: A cloud client may get computing capabilities, similar the practice of numerous servers and network storage, as on demand, without interacting with the cloud provider.

Broad network access: Customers can access the services through heterogeneous thin or thick client tools due to services are brought across the Internet via a standard device that allows.


## Resource pooling:

The cloud provider services a multitenant model to help multiple clients by pooling computing resources, which are dissimilar physical and virtual resources dynamically allocated or reassigned according to client demand.Rapid elasticity: Capabilities might be rapidly and elastically provisioned to quickly scale out or rapidly released to quickly scale in.


## Measured service:

The service bought by clients can be counted and measured.For both the provider and clients, resource usage will be checked, controlled, metered and reported.For that, cloud computing becomes an attractive field to many companies and organization.

Though cloud computing is an influential means of attaining high storage and computing services at a low cost, big organizations are still worried about privacy and also hesitate to move their data to cloud.Privacy issues have been made many limitations to extensive use of cloud computing.There are three main challenges for structure secure and trustworthy cloud systems which are including outsourcing, multi-tenancy and massive data and intense computation (Xiao et al., 2012).Also, users' data are analyzed by cloud providers for a long time.Furthermore, outside attackers who achieve to get access to the cloud can also analyze data and disrupt user privacy.Cloud is not only a source of huge static data, but also a provider of high processing volume at low cost.This makes cloud more susceptible as attackers can use the raw processing power of cloud to analyze data (Chow et al., 2009).Especially, there are multiple data analysis are available that effectively extract valued information from a large volume of data.Researches on cloud privacy issues are either cited as general researches, but within a conversation related with privacy, or linked to the privacy issues that are labelled in the own subsections.This study presents a survey on numerous research on cloud computing, provides a survey on several research on cloud privacy issues, categorizes current solutions for privacy issues in cloud environments as architectures, approaches and methods and the advantages and disadvantages of current studies are tabulated.Furthermore, it also discusses open research challenges and recommended future research directions.The main goal of this study is to offer a better understanding of the privacy challenges of cloud computing and to emphasis on current gaps in order to protect privacy of customers in cloud computing.


## CLOUD COMPUTING

Cloud computing is recognised by Williams (2010) and Beloglazov et al. (2012) as an abstraction which is based on pooling physical resources notions and presented as a virtual resource.It is also identified as a technology which is considered as the next big step towards the development and implementations of an increasing number of distributed applications, (Marinescu, 2012).Cloud computing systems are typically homogeneous and the same level of security, resource management, cost and other policies are shared by all the users.The could computing can be described by term an umbrella which defines a category of sophisticated on-demand computing services offered by commercial providers, for example Amazon, Google and Microsoft, (Rajkumar et al., 2011).Sadeghi et al. (2010) has defined the cloud computing system as infrastructure and computational services on demand for different clients on shared resources or network such as Amazon EC2 (computation) or S3 (storage), over platform services such as Microsoft's database service SQL Azure or Google App Engine.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (Mell and Grance, 2011) defines Cloud Computing as characteristic to deliver and deployment of specific models.Pearson and Charlesworth (2009) has listed the key characteristics defined by NIST as including the sharing of resources and resource pooling technology such as multi-tenancy and virtualization.Cloud computing offers reliable and customized computing environments for extensive internet users due to it has a very great computing paradigm (Gong et al., 2013).They provided survey on cloud computing, which highlight its key ideas, architecture, state of the art application and some main challenges.They aimed is to provide a good guidance of the design challenges of cloud computing and also explained numerous significant research directions in this field.Consequently, cloud computing system has become a necessity and attractive computing paradigm which can provide customized and reliable computing system for extensive Internet users.In future, it can be considered as one of the basic utility following water, electricity, gas and telephone.So, it is being accepted widely and utilized in business industry.Though, there are multiple advantages of cloud computing systems but it also brings number challenges such as security and privacy which are needed to be settled.

Privacy challenges in cloud computing: Sun et al. (2011) have presented and discussed the key issues related to security, secrecy and reliance on cloud computing systems (Sun et al., 2011;Gellman and Forum, 2009;Chow et al., 2009).The tangible and intangible threats related to cloud systems have been discussed in details so that clients can understand these types of threats such as security, privacy and trust.The authors have analyzed the different mechanism used to eliminate the privacy, security and trust threats and provide a secure, trustworthy and dependable cloud computing system.Tchifilionova (2011) has described that the Security and privacy would be a persisting threats on cloud systems until clients fully understand the cloud system i.e., who manages the system, how it works and whether the company can afford to "leak" their private information decision that can only be used after a careful risks analysis and policy considerations otherwise they may simply get lost in the cloud.Xiao et al. (2012) have discussed the five most representative attributes related to security and privacy of cloud system such as accessibility, secrecy, accountability, reliability and privacy-preservability.The relationships among these parameter, the vulnerabilities misused by attackers, the threat models and existing defense strategies in a cloud scenario have been described.It has been suggested that the privacy should not be separated from security due to its importance particularly in cloud system.Privacy is as strongly related to security, as well as the security attributes have positive or negative impact on privacy.Porwal et al. (2011) and King and Raja (2012) have described the issues regarding to data protection on cloud computing system and pointed out some privacy laws which should be enforced in the EU.It has been concluded the cloud system should include high level regulatory recommendations data protection, security, transfer, confidentiality and non-disclosure, intellectual property, law enforcement access, risk allocation and limitation of liability change of control, audit.Wayne and Hafner (2012) have successfully developed a measurement system based on standardized dimensions to assess privacy risks in cloud environments and described in details the drawbacks of current techniques which are applied in cloud computing systems.Svantesson and Clarke (2010) have identified the cloud computing systems with serious risks to privacy and consumer rights and that current privacy law may able to settle some of these threats.Chadwick and Fatema (2012) have presented an infrastructure service run on authorization infrastructure.The proposed infrastructure ensures the users' privacy policy and access would always be monitored and managed by the policies even for the transferring of data between cloud providers or services.Adrian (2013) have determined whether or not a cloud computing infrastructure can provide privacy regulation.The issues regarding to the privacy and personal information, privacy and the Internet, privacy and cloud computing have been discussed in details.Hou et al. (2011) have addressed the issues regarding to the forensic investigation and employed homomorphic encryption and commutative encryption to solve the problem.By using the proposed method the investigators can extract the required evidences without exploiting the privacy of other users.At the same time, the service provider cannot identify in what sort of information the investigators are interested.Pearson et al. (2009) have presented a co-regulation strategy which involves the corporate responsibility model.The model is underpinned primarily by contract which places the onus upon the data controller to follow a more proactive technique to ensure compliance.But at the same time, it encourages cloud service providers and their subcontractors to compete in the service provision arena, at least in part, on the basis of at least maintaining good and ideally evolving better, privacy enhancing mechanisms and processes.Khan et al. (2012) have illustrated the data privacy related issues on cloud computing system (Chen and Zhao, 2012).A concise analysis has been presented on data security and privacy protection problems related to cloud computing for all different stages of data life cycle.Some solutions related to such data security issues have also been discussed such as Decentralized Information Flow Control (DIFC), fully homomorphic encryption scheme, differential privacy protection technology, a mathematical way to verify the integrity of the data, Data Integrity (PDI) solution and clientbased privacy management.For the issues related to privacy protection techniques for instance K anonymous, Graph anonymization and data preprocessing methods, a privacy protection model using Information Accountability (IA) components have also been presented and discussed.Patel et al. (2013) have surveyed and described the latest developed Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPSs) and alarm management techniques by describing a comprehensive taxonomy and exploring possible solutions to identify and avoid intrusions on cloud computing environments.By assuming the required features of IDPS and cloud systems, a list of germane requirements are described and presented the four concepts of autonomic computing self-management, ontology, risk management and fuzzy theory to fulfil these requirements.Itani et al. (2009) have proposed PasS set of security protocols to ensure the secrecy of client data on cloud infrastructure.The security solution depends on cryptographic coprocessors which provide a trusted and isolated execution environment on the cloud.The PasS protocol system and the privacy enforcement mechanisms supported by these protocols have been discussed in details.The description for the proof of concept implementation has also been presented.


## CURRENT SOLUTIONS OF PRIVACY ISSUES IN CLOUD COMPUTING

This section will discuss the current solutions for privacy issues in cloud.It classified into three subsections which are including architecture, framework, approach and method to become more attractive from the reader.

Architecture and framework for solving privacy issue in cloud: Nandipati and Sridevi (2013) have investigated a new cloud framework known as Data Protection as a Service, which is able to reduce the perapplication development efforts dramatically which are required for data protection and mean time it also allows the rapid development and maintenance.The DPaaS paradigm offers logging and auditing at the platform level to share the advantages of all applications running on top.Sykes et al. (2013) have presented a model acting by three distinct logical components: the Privacy Service Mediator (PSM) Mobile Device Agent (MDAg) and cloud services.Using the PSM, the communication between mobile applications and cloud services have been proposed.It analyzed the exchange of information in privacy perspective.Using a command design pattern, the mobile application could bundle the cloud-service calls into a chain of command objects which are linked and sent to PSM for execution via MDAg.Ke et al. (2013) built a privacy negotiation model between service provider and user on the basis of description logic, transforming the pre-negotiation of privacy policy for decidable issue of Tableau algorithm.The privacy policy negotiation is composed of two steps:

Step 1: With Tableau algorithm of description logic, by detecting the conflicts of privacy attribute collections, they can obtain the Privacy Knowledge Base (PKB) that satisfy user requirements.

Step 2: Through ordinal exchange of privacy disclosure assertion based on privacy attribute sequences between user and service provider, they obtain the privacy policy that meet both user and service provider privacy requirements.Pearson et al. (2009) have discussed a privacy managing system for cloud computing environment, which decrease the risk of user's private information being misused and also helps the cloud systems provider to ensure the privacy laws.The different possible framework for cloud system to manage privacy of clients has been discussed in details such as algebraic description of obfuscation which is one of the important features of privacy manager.The authors have also described how these manages might be employed to protect the clients private metadata of online photos on cloud system.The issues related to privacy manager have been addressed, which can help cloud system clients to manage the privacy of own data on cloud environment.

Two types of the Secure Cloud Computing (SCC) systems are proposed by Yang and Lai (2013).One of them is with Trusted Third Party (TTP) and the other is without TTP.The main objective of their schemes is to protect the data privacy and security in the cloud server.They added the symmetric property in secret sharing to successfully reduce the cost to share the shares between the client and the server.Also, by the homomorphism property of secret sharing, they extend SSC to Multiserver SCC (MSCC) fitting the multi-server environment.As compared to the previous data Privacy by Authentication and Secret Sharing (PASS), their schemes have the better security and performance.Santos et al. (2009) have presented a new design for a reliable Cloud Computing Platform (TCCP) which provides IaaS services as Amazon EC2 for closed box execution environment.TCCP ensures the trustworthy execution of guest VMs and permits clients to verify the IaaS provider and able to know if the service is safe and secure before the clients launch their VMs.Song et al. (2011) have presented a new framework for privacy-protected private data recovery service known as parity cloud service.Parity cloud service provides solution for all problems related to cloud system such as consistency, economical efficiency, accessibility and confidentiality while developing personal data recovery service.The proposed approach is simple and does not involves any resources for privacy protection.It works on collaboration-based data recovery algorithm in which the data loss rate is very less.Wang et al. (2010) have proposed a privacypreserving public auditing system for security of stored data on cloud system, where TPA (Third Party Auditing) performs audit for stored data without demanding the local copy of data.In the proposed system a homomorphic authenticator and random mask techniques are used to ensure that TPA would not get any information regarding to the data content stored on the cloud system while running the auditing process.The careful security and performance analysis have shown that the proposed frameworks are proved safe and highly efficient.It has believed that the security and high efficiency of proposed frameworks will shed light on economies of scale for Cloud Computing.Lu and Tsudik (2011) have presented a scheme from avoiding the cloud server to learn any possible sensitive plaintext in the outsourced databases.Furthermore, the proposed scheme also provides private querying so that neither database holder nor the cloud server can access the query details.An additional condition such as client's input is authorized by Cloud Auditing (CA).An encryption scheme has been incorporated to protect data secrecy and permit access control.The scheme is developed to retrieve search token and decryption key for a user from database owner without showing query contents.But their proposal scheme has some limitation such as, it only supports equality testing and hides concrete contents in the conditional expression and does not support the join operations between two tables.Schiering and Kretschmer (2012) presented a prototype of an IaaS cloud service which serves as a basis for Software Services (SaaS) compliant with this European directive.This is achieved by a combination of organizational and technical measures accompanied by auditing and monitoring.Ranchal et al. (2010) have presented a new technique for Identity Management (IDM) systems independent of Trusted Third Party (TTP) and able to utilize identity data for un-trusted hosts.The technique is based on using of predicates over encrypted data and multi-party computing to negotiate use of cloud system.Chuang et al. (2011) have presented an affective privacy protection framework for cloud environment to provide confidentiality to users' data without affecting system performance.The proposed scheme is able to analyze associated information, by picking the most suitable combination of encryption algorithm and number of data division to deliver more safe protection or decrease performance overhead.Their simulation results showed that the proposed scheme satisfies userdemand privacy requirement and offers the better performance at the same time.Mishra et al. (2011) have focused simultaneously data confidentiality and harmonizing the relations intact on cloud system.The proposed framework offers data owner to perform computation intensive tasks on cloud servers without unveiling data contents or user access privilege information.


## Approach or prototype for solving privacy issue in cloud:


## Methods for solving privacy issue in cloud:

To tackle security and privacy problems associated to cloud system, Wang (2011) have proposed four effective methods.The proposed methods are based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC).The key parameters in the cloud-based RBAC model are cloud clients, access authorization, role and session.The policy integration method has employed to solve the multi-policy issues.To avoid the unauthorized usage of the cloud data, one identification management method and user control method have been proposed which can be employed to the generalized cloud computing system.Mowbray and Pearson (2009) have developed a privacy manager software which is based on user's assistance i.e., whether the client can protect his secrecy while accessing cloud system.Fundamental feature of privacy manager are based on obfuscation and de-obfuscation service to limit the quantity of sensitive data stored on a cloud.Also, the privacy manager assists cloud's clients to choose privacy preferences about the handling of his private data by different personae, revising and modifying of data stored on cloud system, etc. Obfuscation could obfuscate all or a portion of data structure before transmitting to the cloud server.Guo et al. (2010) have developed a technique to produce a rank list of sub-schemas for publishing.These subschemas regulate the predictive performance on the target variable, but bound the prediction accuracy against the private attributes.Experiments have been conducted on a financial database to express the efficiency of the strategy.Experimental results have shown that the proposed technique is able to generate sub-schemas which can regulate and maintain high accuracies against the target variables, while keeping the predictive capability low against private attributes.

Ulltveit-Moe and Oleshchuk ( 2010) have worked on classification of privacy leakages in the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) rules.The Procedure Related to Privacy Leakage (PRILE) is a general procedure which is compatible to any IDS system.Five general classification tasks have been identified which have been analyzed in the PRILE procedure and two of them are investigated based on a Naïve Bayes classifier.The limitation in employed method is that the analysis is snort specific.The employed procedure, PRILE, is still in its initial stages, therefore more investigation are required to realize objective view.Mowbray et al. (2010) have discussed the privacy manager issues related to cloud computing system, specifically which controls policy-based obfuscation and de-obfuscation of personal, sensitive, or confidential data within cloud service provision.


## RESEARCH GAB IN CLOUD PRIVACY ISSUE

In summary, this literature review addresses the definitions of privacy and how the risk of privacy exposure has grown in terms of importance to the enterprise.It also presents authors who searched in this manner.Some researchers are believed to separate privacy from security due to its significance particular for cloud systems.Privacy is considered as highly related to security, also other security attributes have positive or negative impact on privacy of the system.A number of Cloud Computing system providers have concerned about security and privacy problems and they are unable to sort out appropriate solution in five aspects (i.e., availability, confidentiality, data integrity,  et al. (2012) Identified cloud as an abstraction based on the notion of pooling physical resources, presented the NIST draft definition and described five essential characteristics Marinescu (2012) Identified cloud in other way as the next big stage in the development and deployment of an increasing number of distributed applications Rajkumar et al. (2011) It presented on demand computing services that provided by cloud providers including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Sadeghi et al. (2010) Presented cloud services NIST (2009) Defined cloud computing and presented its characteristics, specific delivery models and deployment models Pearson and Charlesworth (2009) Listed the key characteristics defined by NIST Gong et al.

## CONCLUSION

In recent years, the improvement of cloud computing has provided opportunities for investigation in all aspects of cloud computing.Cloud computing is becoming more attractive for many organizations due to fact that it provides multiple computing services as cloud storage, cloud hosting and cloud servers etc. Although, there are numerous benefits of cloud computing, governments and big organizations are concerned about security and privacy issues on cloud.Privacy of cloud system is a serious concern for the customers.The aim of this study is twofold.Firstly, it surveys on cloud computing.Secondly, it surveys on cloud privacy issue and available solutions.Also, a classified of present solutions for privacy issues in cloud environments is provided in this study.The advantages and disadvantages of current studies are tabulated.It also discusses open research challenges and recommends future research directions.
