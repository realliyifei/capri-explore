## (s2) PATHOGENIC MECHANISM OF INFECTION
(p2.0) Experimental animal models of bone infection have revealed that bone is highly resistant to infection.Thus, osteomyelitis arises only when there is a large organism inoculation, trauma leading to bone damage, or the presence of foreign material (Eid, Berbari, 2012).

(p2.1) The pathophysiology of osteomyelitis is multifactorial and begins with spread of the organism.Bacteria may reach the bone by hematogenous seeding, direct inoculation, or airborne contamination (Gogia et al., 2009).Fungal osteomyelitis is more likely to result from disseminated fungal infection than direct inoculation of the bone (Eid, Berbari, 2012).
## (s3) CAUSAL ORGANISMS
(p3.0) The most common pathogens responsible for osteomyelitis in humans are Staphylococcus species, followed by Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species (Gogia et al., 2009).A summary of different etiology related to age and the predisposing conditions is shown in Table I.
## (s7) Beta-lactams and lincosamides
(p7.0) Intravenous beta-lactams antibiotics (i.e.penicillins and cephalosporins) were commonly used to treat osteomyelitis due to their efficacy and relative safety when given for a prolonged period of time (Eid, Berbari, 2012).As new oral regimens become available, and the prevalence of MRSA increases, intravenous beta-lactams are likely to become less widely used for osteomyelitis treatment (Eid, Berbari, 2012).Oral beta-lactams are more effective in pediatric osteomyelitis, as compared to adults, as is the rate of healing (Pawar, Bhandari, 2011).

(p7.1) Oral cephalosporins, e.g., cephalexin, ceftriaxone are often used clinically.Once-daily administered drugs, such as ceftriaxone, are preferred, especially for outpatient therapy (Lazzarini et al., 2005).Also, clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic active against most gram-positive bacteria, has excellent oral bioavailability and high bone serum ratios and is currently given orally after initial intravenous treatment for 1 to 2 weeks (Calhoun, Manring, 2005;Pawar, Bhandari, 2011).
## (s10) Glicopeptides
(p10.0) The only drugs with a constant efficacy against all the staphylococcal strains, and which have been extensively studied in the treatment of bone infections, are glycopeptides, in particular vancomycin (Yin et al., 2005;Courvalin, 2006).Vancomycin is used to treat MRSA and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus species (Eid, Berbari, 2012).Unfortunately, resistance to this antibiotic has already been recognized as a major problem in the treatment of Gram-positive pathogens and increasing data suggest that vancomycin is losing its clinical and microbiological potency.Increased prevalence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is already limiting its usage (Rice, 2006;Moise et al., 2009;Pawar, Bhandari, 2011;Vilhena, Bettencourt, 2012).Moenster et al. (2012) states that despite adequate dosing, 30% to 50% of patients experience infection recurrence within 12 months.
## (s11) New agents
(p11.0) Newer antibiotics with high bone penetration such as linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline are promising for treating osteomyelitis due to MRSA in patients who display intolerance or poor response to vancomycin but must be further tested in clinical trials (Lazzarini et al., 2005;Aslam, Darouiche, 2009;Pawar, Bhandari, 2011).A good review on the topic was recently published by Pawar and Bhandari (2011).

(p11.1) Linezolid, which can be administered either orally or intravenously, represents a new class of antibiotic with no cross-resistance to other antibiotics.It is active against Gram-positive organisms including VRE (E.faecium and E. faecalis) and MRSA (Darley, MacGowan, 2004;Calhoun, Manring, 2005).It has been proved effective for treating serious infections, including osteomyelitis (Calhoun, Manring, 2005).Long-term safety and efficacy data needs to be produced in bone and joint infections, since they are lacking.Additionally, no large randomized trials have been published on the use of linezolid for orthopaedic infections (Pawar, Bhandari, 2011).
## (s17) Non-Biodegradable systems
(p17.0) Antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads and self-setting bone cement have been used to treat chronic osteomyelitis allowing the local delivery of high concentrations of antibiotics, while avoiding potential systemic side effects (Anagnostakos et al., 2006;Azi et al., 2010).
## (s18) Biodegradable systems
(p18.0) In order to address some of the drawbacks of local delivery with PMMA, the use of local antibiotics from a biodegradable implant for osteomyelitis is an attractive alternative and has been actively investigated in recent years.Major advantages of these implants include obliteration of dead space, aid to bone repair, wider selection of antibiotics including thermolabile ones and no need for a second surgery for removal (Table IV) (Gitelis, Brebach, 2002).
