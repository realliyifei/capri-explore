## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0)  H. pylori: Bacterium H. pylori characterstics: GRAM -ve. Microaerophilic bacteria with helical structure. Natural colonization of the stomach lamina of individuals and nonhuman mammal. Not found in other animals. Prevalencehigh; around 80% [1].
## (s1)  Ghrelin
(p1.0) LENOMORELIN, also known as hunger hormone is a twenty eight -amino corrosive gastricobtained peptide. Ghrelin-delivering cells are a different gathering of endocrine cells found all through the gastric mucosa, as well as the small intestine and the endocrine pancreas to a lesser extent. Ghrelin levels in the blood increase during fasting and chronic caloric restriction to encourage food intake and fat storage while also preventing life-threatening blood glucose dips.

(p1.1) Ghrelin inhibits the proliferation of breast, lung, and thyroid cell lines, as well as protecting the gastric mucosa. Ghrelin accelerates stomach emptying and increases acid secretion in the gastrointestinal tract via vagal stimulation. Ghrelin levels fluctuate a lot depending on how much energy the body needs. Exogenous ghrelin has been shown to enormously decrease (NF)-B and plasma tumour necrosis factor activation [16].
