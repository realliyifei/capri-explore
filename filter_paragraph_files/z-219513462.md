## (s2) EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF AKI: LIMITATIONS OF SCR AND THE ROLE OF NEW BIOMARKERS
(p2.0) The high incidence (13-18% in hospitalized patients) and the serious complications of AKI, combined with the inability of current markers to diagnose AKI in an early and reversible stage in order to take corrective measures, led nephrologists to examine possible biomarkers of kidney damage to improve risk assessment, early detection, differential diagnosis and prognosis of AKI [23]. Even though the definition and diagnosis of AKI are still based on serum creatine increase and/or diuresis decrease, certain characteristics limit their diagnostic value. Limitations of sCr as a marker of kidney injury include modulation by age, gender, hydration status, diet, muscle mass and medication [24]. Furthermore, in the AKI setting, there is a considerable time difference between actual renal injury, actual GFR changes and increases in sCr [25] that inhibit accurate estimation regarding the timing of renal injury and the associated reduction in renal function. Thus a severe renal injury may be combined with relatively small sCr changes in the first 24À48 h after AKI, leading to a false sense of security resulting in delayed therapeutic actions. All of the above decrease the utility of sCr as a tool for making treatment decisions in critically ill patients or in patients during the post-operative period, such as the decision to change nephrotoxic drugs or measures to increase renal perfusion [23].

(p2.1) As a result, in recent years, through the understanding of the biochemical, structural and functional changes caused by AKI, a set of new biomarkers for AKI was proposed. These substances are either low-molecular weight proteins that are freely filtered from the glomerulus and fully reabsorbed by the proximal tubule or proteins of normal tubular cells [24]. In cases   of parenchymal kidney damage, the normal uptake and metabolism of these substances are substantially disturbed, thus their concentration in urine or even serum may increase rapidly and significantly. Also, this increase may occur long before that of the routine indicators used for renal function estimation, i.e. sCr. The main characteristics of the most widely used urine/serum biomarkers with proven correlation to AKI are presented in Table 2 [26].

(p2.2) Although evidence strongly suggests that these biomarkers are useful for assessing early renal damage, there are several issues potentially limiting their routine use. The ideal AKI biomarker is one that can predict and diagnose AKI; identify the location, type and aetiology of injury; predict outcomes and enable initiation and monitoring of therapeutic interventions [24]. Thus, presently, there is no single perfect AKI biomarker. The various biomarkers may indicate different mechanisms of injury, such as hypoxia [liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP)] or ischaemia [kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)]. Moreover, the site of syntheses and also the kinetics of activation after kidney injury differ among these biomarkers [40][41][42]. Furthermore, factors such as time after exposure to injury, baseline renal function and subclinical underlying kidney disease may modify biomarker temporal profiles and should be considered when interpreting biomarker performance [43]. The post-operative changes in urine biomarkers, including peak level time point and the duration of increase above a certain threshold, as well as other issues, still need larger sample studies to be clarified [44]. Meanwhile, standardization of the kits used for measurements of these biomarkers is also a matter of concern. Therefore a combination of biomarkers may be necessary to provide the best diagnostic and prognostic information in a context-specific manner. It was reported that combining two to five biomarkers at different time points from 0 to 12 h post-operatively can improve the diagnostic accuracy [17,45,46].
## (s4) EFFECTS OF ENDOUROLOGICAL PROCEDURES ON NOVEL AKI BIOMARKERS
(p4.0) In recent years, numerous studies have evaluated the epidemiology and prognostic importance of AKI, as well as the role of new biomarkers in its diagnosis in different settings and populations, including intensive care unit patients, general surgery patients, adults and children after cardiac surgery and other patient groups [71][72][73][74][75][76]. In most such studies, the novel biomarkers were shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for AKI diagnosis. In contrast, there is a relevant paucity of studies using these modern biomarkers for early diagnosis of renal impairment after endourological surgeries for kidney stones. To identify possible studies, a review of the literature was performed using PubMed up to January 2019. Original works restricted to the English language were identified referring to the correlation between endourological procedures for the management of kidney stones and urine biomarkers. The literature search, which was conducted by the first author by using the keywords percutaneous nephrolithotomy, PCNL, ureteroscopy, URS, RIRS, renal failure, AKI, urine biomarkers, serum biomarkers, renal function, NAG, NGAL, cystatin C, KIM -1, L-FABP and interleukin 18 (IL-18), resulted in a limited number of studies. Due to study heterogeneity and the non-standardized quality appraisal, a narrative synthesis was performed. The limitations of using a single database for review were taken into account [77].

(p4.1) Only six studies were found to investigate the effect of endourological procedures on renal function by using urine (n ¼ 5) or serum (n ¼ 1) biomarkers for early diagnosis of AKI [3][4][5][51][52][53], while only two of them used modern definition criteria of AKI [4,53]. The basic characteristics of these studies are presented in Table 4.
## (s6) FURTHER RESEARCH AGENDA
(p6.0) Further research on the effect of endourological procedures on renal injury and renal function is clearly needed. As discussed, different pathophysiological mechanisms leading to renal injury for each endourological procedure have been proposed [4,6,34,65]; however, as of this writing, details on the nature and extent of renal injury during each of these procedures is still lacking, possibly because of the inappropriate structure of the studies (e.g. lack of a modern definition of AKI, use of only conventional indexes of renal function instead of markers of renal injury, incorrect timing of measurements, small sample size, short follow-up, incorrect or absent reporting of surgical parameters, etc.). Appropriate studies include observational efforts on the incidence of properly defined AKI after each type of endourological procedure during the short-term post-operative period as well as the effects of these procedures on longterm renal function (Table 6). Furthermore, as the field of novel biomarkers is currently expanding there are certain issues that should be addressed in some detail. For example, the associations (including positive and negative predictive values) between specific cut-off levels of these biomarkers and diagnosis of AKI, in general, are still being researched. In addition, in endourological procedures, a theoretical increase of biomarkers could be expected due to the effect of the surgery on renal tissue, but also a decrease of the same biomarkers should be seen due to stone removal, resulting in difficulty in quantification of these procedure's overall effects on the kidney. Thus the optimal time points for biomarker sampling after endourological procedures and the optimal biomarker reflecting renal injury and aiding the early diagnosis of AKI are issues for future research. After these issues are clarified, proper randomized controlled trials comparing the extent of renal injury and AKI incidence between the various endourological procedures for stone treatment can be performed. Furthermore, larger, properly designed studies assessing renal function in the mediumand long-term are required to examine whether renal injury after the endourological procedures is associated with long-term renal function changes.
## (s7) CONCLUSIONS
(p7.0) In recent years, a debate about the comparative efficacy and safety of different endourological surgical methods for the treatment of nephrolithiasis has occurred. The efficacy part (mainly by comparing stone-free rates among the treatment techniques) has been set as a primary outcome and thoroughly examined in several published studies. The safety part has been examined, in most relevant studies, as a secondary outcome only by comparing major complications (bleeding and sepsis). Endourological procedures for the treatment of lithiasis could theoretically affect renal function through various mechanisms, including direct mechanical kidney injury or indirect ways (high IRPs, inflammation or vasoconstriction of adjacent renal vessels) that promote renal parenchymal damage [4,6,34,65]. However, the crucial question of the short-and long-term effects of these surgical procedures on renal tissue has not been extensively or properly studied. In the few existing studies, common indexes of renal function (including sCr, urea or GFR) are used to capture renal damage [34,37,58,67,68], which is not always appropriate. Furthermore, the incidence of AKI induced and its possible long-term detrimental effects on renal function are rarely examined.

(p7.1) Recently emerged biomarkers with higher sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of tubular injury have been used in some studies of endourological procedures [3][4][5][51][52][53], but with no typically conclusive results. Therefore, future studies assessing in detail the time course of changes in these biomarkers, the possibility of renal injury and the incidence of AKI following different types of procedures, as well as the reflection of any possible injury on long-term renal function are warranted. If research in this field successfully identifies biomarkers that can be used to diagnose kidney parenchymal damage and AKI in this setting, then this may offer a new road regarding renal stone surgical treatment, helping urologists to make informed decisions on several issues, from which endourological technique to perform and the optimal duration of surgery to which drugs to administer during the post-operative period, in order to offer patients evidence-based care.
