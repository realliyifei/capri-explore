## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Comorbidity between depression and anxiety is quite common in everyday clinical practice. Similar clinical symptoms ranging from sleep disturbances and mood disorders cause these two disorders considered as one disease. The elevated risk of second disorder symptoms can be understood from a network perspective in psychopathology, where causal interactions between symptoms are theorized to promote the development of psychopathology, including comorbidities 1,2 . Central to the networking perspective is the proposition that psychiatric disorders arise because of symptoms that trigger other symptoms over time, such as when, for example, feelings of lethargy make it challenging to be active during the day, which in turn results in increased sadness and restlessness because a person is not accomplishing what he wants to do. Hypothetically, the more strongly the depressive symptoms of the examples above trigger one another over time (i.e., the higher the tissue density), the more difficult it may be to interfere with activation, which may eventually lead to depressive disorders. 3 This perspective also offers several potential explanations for comorbidities. 2
