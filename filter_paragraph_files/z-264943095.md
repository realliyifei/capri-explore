## (s9) Digital technologies acceptance
(p9.0) Despite the previous efforts, while citizen-public official contact is vital, only a small number of academics have effectively explored the elements affecting the acceptance of eparticipation in this field.The existence of this gap was noticed and documented in both empirical and theoretical contexts.When considering the acceptance of e-participation among users in Malaysia, it is essential to acknowledge that individuals' diverse and sometimes limited levels of proficiency and understanding of government-provided eparticipation platforms can present a significant obstacle to enabling participation [39].

(p9.1) For example, as demonstrated through specific case studies, such as the topic of public participation within the local government of Subang Jaya and public participation practises within the Seremban Municipal Council [39][40].Local governments in Malaysia must maintain constant vigilance regarding the extent of e-participation utilisation [40].This is crucial to facilitate effective planning and successful implementation of policies within their respective jurisdictions.However, the existing studies are unsuccessful in providing a comprehensive analysis of the underlying factors that contribute to the utilisation of eparticipation.Instead, they primarily focus on the general awareness of the programme within the community.

(p9.2) The focus was on examining user evaluations of e-participation usage on the Malaysian e-government website [41].It has been discovered that despite the substantial endeavours undertaken by the Malaysian government to enhance e-participation, there remains a shortage of evaluation about the user experience, particularly concerning the factors on user acceptance of e-participation.Furthermore, they highlighting significant obstacles in advancing e-government within the Malaysian public sector [42].These challenges encompass the persistence of conventional service delivery models, reluctance among officials to embrace cultural transformations within their organisations, client preference for in-person services, and limitations in providing information technology training.Therefore, it is crucial to undertake more studies to find other elements that can affect people's propensity to accept or reject the usage of e-participation across different levels of the Malaysian government.
## (s13) Methodology
(p13.0) A technological research technique proposed was used to compile the theoretical overview of the literature.The development of the model involved using primary sources: a review of relevant theories and models, an analysis of literature reviews, an examination of related literature, and consultation of additional sources [57].This study incorporated all four primary constructs of the UTAUT: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions.This study's models were selected because they have previously been shown to be useful for describing users' acceptance to new technologies [57].Given that this study represents the initial investigation into the fundamental factors influencing e-participation within the Malaysian public sector, the rationale for adopting the factors from UTAUT is deemed appropriate as a solid basis for this study.Moreover, the UTAUT possesses validity and exhibits a robust theoretical integration, thereby facilitating the examination of individual-level adoption by encompassing the consumer context.For enhancing the proposed model and introduce an original component to the study's context, the TRI model has been incorporated.This will facilitate the assessment of an individual's readiness to accept e-participation.It is recommended that TRI models be proposed to examine various antecedents and consequences.This is important for strengthening the TRI model and expanding the existing four factors [58].The inclusion of TRI in this model aligns with the suggestions, which suggest testing TRI in diverse geographical areas and interactive contexts and services.This approach aims to determine whether the findings are consistent across various contexts [59].

(p13.1) Subsequently, the present study undertook a comprehensive examination of existing scholarly literature to ascertain the determinants influencing the acceptance of e-participation within the public sector of Malaysia.the researchers used thematic analysis to weigh the significance of the variables included in the earlier research.To determine the essential elements proposed by earlier research regarding the acceptability of e-participation across different domains, an extensive review of a total of 36 research articles was done.The preceding studies have provided valuable insights that inform the model development for this research study.In brief, the model incorporates four factors from UTAUT: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence.An additional set of four factors is derived from the TRI model: optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity.
## (s15) Performance expectancy
(p15.0) Individuals' levels of confidence in a certain technology's ability to enhance their performance at work and/or their productivity are known as their "performance expectancy."[12].Suppose individuals hold the belief that the utilisation of technology will enhance their ability to complete tasks in a more efficient, effective, or successful manner.In that case, their expectations regarding performance will probably be elevated.Considering this, it is anticipated that users will possess elevated expectations regarding the efficacy of the technology, potentially leading to enhanced levels of acceptance and utilisation.When people have confidence that a new piece of technology will improve their efficiency, they are more likely to adopt and use it [12].Furthermore, this methodology can be applied in mandatory and voluntary situations, and it represents the most efficient predictor variable for predicting future behaviour [12].

(p15.1) Individual's performance expectancy in the context of e-participation in the public sector is the degree to which they believe that their participation in online activities will allow them to benefit personally or help others, thereby improving the efficiency of public institutions.Simultaneously, the government's recognition of the expectation of performance suggests an understanding that engaging in participation activities can enhance productivity and mitigate the presence of inefficient bureaucratic processes.E-participation technologies, including online petitioning, online complaint applications, and online participatory budgeting, encourage the utilisation of digital tools for individuals to articulate their concerns through various mediums, such as text messaging, images, and videos.

(p15.2) Furthermore, this basis facilitates individuals who embrace innovative concepts to attain distinct advantages over alternative technologies within the organisation [57].Organisations frequently determine the advantages and user-friendliness of e-participation as critical considerations before embarking on its implementation and utilisation by the user.The organisation seeks to achieve a positive return on investment and enhance business growth through substantial financial contributions.Hence, it can be believed that there is a reasonable basis to suggest that performance expectancy will substantially impact the acceptance of individual e-participation.
## (s17) Social influence
(p17.0) The concept of social influence factor pertains to the extent to which an individual thinks that influential individuals hold the belief that they should adopt the new system [12].The level of support from one's peer group plays a crucial role in adopting and consistently using new technology [12].The study into the necessity of technology for users may be determined by societal factors [12].The pressure of technology usage on individuals may lead to a sense of negativity [12].

(p17.1) While from the angle of social psychology, social influence refers to the phenomenon wherein interactions and connections with different people shape an individual's perspectives, attitudes, and actions [12].There exist multiple processes through which individuals in society can be affected by others, encompassing deliberate convincing, societal pressure to comply, and comparisons with others.An individual's social network can positively and negatively impact their overall well-being [61].The impact of peer influence can lead to favourable alterations in an individual's motivation, self-esteem, and social support, all of which positively affect the individual's behaviour and overall well-being [62].In contrast, social influence can result in various negative consequences, including but not limited to pressure, stress, and the emergence of unfavourable attitudes or behaviours [63].Within this study, it is advisable for government organisations in Malaysia that provide advanced technologies to their constituents to consider the significance of influential individuals when striving to enhance citizens' readiness and acceptance.

(p17.2) Furthermore, the acceptance of e-participation may be influenced by social factors such as the involvement of individuals on online social media networks, affiliation with political individuals, and influential figures [64].The support and motivation provided by individuals can catalyse for others to engage in e-participation and contribute their ideas.This, in turn, enhances the likelihood of increased system utilisation, particularly within public sector agencies.A study that emphasised the user's reliance on feedback and the experiences of early adopters when engaging with new technologies.Hence, the phenomenon of social influence will impact the level of acceptance displayed by individuals towards utilising eparticipation.
## (s18) Facilitating conditions
(p18.0) Facilitating conditions refer to how well a person believes an organisational and technological infrastructure exists to assist the system's usage [65].The factor can determine whether an individual positively or negatively impacts their technology adoption and use.For instance, users may possess more facilitating conditions to facilitate their transition to new technology.These conditions may include having access to the necessary hardware and software, experiencing adequate instruction, and having readily available technical assistance to support them using [66].When people believe that the system's condition is in a favourable state, they are more likely to accept and use novel technology well.

(p18.1) The UTAUT demonstrates that the variable of facilitating conditions directly influences the user's behaviour.This study also draws attention to the importance for Malaysian government organisations to provide adequate training and support to their personnel before citizens to facilitate the successful adoption and utilisation of new technologies.This might include giving people the tools they need to succeed, including computers and software, as well as giving them the chance to learn how to use them properly.
## (s19) TRI factors
(p19.0) The optimism factor in e-participation pertains to a favourable or positive belief concerning using electronic methods for public participation in public deliberation and decision-making procedures.The perception is that e-participation programmes and their technologies have the potential to generate favourable outcomes and advantages for both citizens and governments.When individuals have a positive outlook regarding e-participation, they are more willing to involve themselves and actively participate in online platforms, forums, or other digital channels created explicitly for public participation.The cultivation and preservation of optimism within e-participation endeavours are of utmost significance, necessitating the establishment of well-crafted, user-centric, secure, and inclusive platforms.Government organisations would need to exhibit the impact and worth of e-participation by providing feedback on citizen contributions, implementing changes derived from public input, and consistently communicating with them about benefits of e-participation processes.

(p19.1) The factor of innovativeness, which can be understood as an individual's positive preference towards exploring new concepts and embracing change within an organisation, is a distinguishing characteristic that sets apart those who adapt to organisational transformations.Studying new techniques and recent advancements will acquaint consumers with other efficient approaches, ultimately enhancing quality.The presence of a forwardthinking user and service provider can significantly enhance work performance, making it more efficient and easily accessible.Incorporating and leveraging new technologies and online resources to enhance public participation is crucial to innovativeness.Citizens can be involved in decision-making by utilising various technological tools such as social media, mobile applications, online forums, crowdsourcing platforms, and other innovative mechanisms.Moreover, the aspect of innovativeness in e-participation frequently entails the willingness to engage in the exploration of innovative methods and strategies.This may encompass implementing new platforms, experimenting with unique citizen participation methods, or investigating inventive approaches to gathering and analysing citizen input.This also entails proactively soliciting participant feedback, closely monitoring e-participation initiatives' efficacy, and making necessary adjustments informed by acquired knowledge and emerging exemplary approaches.This necessitates an individual psychological orientation welcoming to any modification and adjustment.The process entails acknowledging individuals' dynamic requirements and preferences while also being receptive to advancements in technology and societal changes.

(p19.2) On the other hand, the discomfort factor relating to e-participation relates to the senses of unease, doubt, or negativity that individuals may encounter while engaging in online platforms or activities designed for public participation and the decision-making process.Specific individuals may experience unease or reluctance when engaging in e-participation efforts because of their limited exposure to digital technologies or insufficient proficiency in digital literacy.Individuals may encounter difficulties managing online environments, giving input, or recognising the technological requirements, resulting in unease.Being exposed to certain situations or circumstances can cause feelings of vulnerability in individuals, which in turn may result in the sense of unease or hesitation to engage or partake in indicated situations.Furthermore, in today's online environments, individuals are vulnerable to encountering online insults, abuse, or unpleasant interactions by irresponsible online users.Individuals who have encountered negative experiences in the past or perceive potential risks associated with e-participation activities may experience discomfort when engaging in such activities.The insecurity factor pertains to the emotional states of confusion, nervousness, or risk that individuals may encounter when participating in online platforms or engaging in public participation and decision-making activities.This technical issue includes concerns regarding user privacy, safeguarding of data, and possible threats linked to disseminating personal information or describing viewpoints on the internet anonymously.Individuals may experience a sense of insecurity regarding the confidentiality of their data when engaging in e-participation endeavours.Individuals may experience concerns regarding gathering, retaining, and possibly misusing their personal information, resulting in feelings of unease or hesitancy to participate.The Malaysian public sector is affected by ongoing debates surrounding various issues, including security, privacy data, and implementation costs [68,69].Moreover, insecurity can arise due to a deficiency in confidence towards the eparticipation process or the governing authorities responsible for its oversight.Concerns regarding the level of transparency in the decision-making process, the degree of responsiveness to citizen input, and the potential influence of external interests within the public sector can cause insecurity.Therefore, governmental organisations must establish a secure and reliable environment for the e-participation process.This will enable individuals to engage confidently and provide valuable feedback that contributes meaningfully to decision-making processes.
