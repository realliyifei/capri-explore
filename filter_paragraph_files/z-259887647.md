## (s8) Australia
(p8.0) The Senate is Australia's upper house and plays an important role in supporting the interests of states and territories. With an equal number of senators from each state and territory, the Senate ensures that smaller jurisdictions have a proportionate say in the legislative process. This equal representation recognizes the importance of regional concerns and strives to prevent larger states from dominating. Its major duty is to serve as a chamber of states, allowing states and territories to express their concerns and protect their interests. It serves as a check on the Chamber of Representatives, the lower chamber, by analyzing and altering legislation offered by the administration. This procedure guarantees that legislation considers the viewpoints and needs of all jurisdictions, thereby ensuring a fair and inclusive legislative framework.

(p8.1) Furthermore, the Senate has the authority to review and amend fiscal measures, strengthening its role in representing states and territories. The Senate can use this function to address specific regional issues and advocate for allocating resources and financing to certain jurisdictions (Brenton, 2015).
## (s13) B. Pakistan's Lower House
(p13.0) The National Assembly is Pakistan's principal legislative body and the lower house of the Parliament. Members of the National Assembly, often known as MNAs, are directly elected by the people under a system of universal adult suffrage. The National Assembly wields considerable legislative authority and responsibility. It is in charge of initiating and enacting legislation, including fiscal laws. Typically, the government is formed by the political party or coalition with a majority in the National Assembly. The National Assembly, as the people's representative, is critical in expressing residents' ambitions and interests. It acts as a forum for the discussion and resolution of national issues, allowing different points of view to be heard and weighed. Members of the National Assembly discuss government policies and propose laws to address the interests and concerns of the Pakistani people (Ahmed, 2022).
