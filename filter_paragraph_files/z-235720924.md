## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Artificial insemination (AI) is a powerful and unique technique for fertilizing the females of most mammals. The first animal was conceived using AI in 1784, and the first trial to produce straw for AI was at the beginning of the 20 th century [1]. AI was intended to increase the number of insemination doses from a single ejaculate but was unsuccessful because of the absence of sperm-washing procedures for both chilled or frozen-thawed semen of the male donor. These techniques are considered the foundation stone in the history of AI [1]. Moreover, AI is widely applied in cattle [2] and humans [3] but less in sheep [4], buffalos [5], horses [6], deer [7], and other mammals [8].

(p0.1) To improve economic efficiency, AI can impact different productivity projects, such as cattle and sheep husbandry and increasing weaning weight. Therefore, AI has a remarkable ability to impact economic feasibility [9].
## (s1) Preservation of Semen
(p1.0) The two primary techniques for semen storage are chilling and cryopreservation. For the chilling technique, semen is stored at 4-5°C for 3 days for maximum and best results. In the cryopreservation technique, semen is exposed to freezing for 3 h at 4°C. Meanwhile, it is filled into 0.25-mL straws and finally preserved and stored in liquid nitrogen for years [14]. Therefore, the crucial factors for long-term semen preservation to retain its quality include cooling for 2-3 h, adding a cryoprotectant, and freezing in liquid nitrogen [15].
## (s16) LDL extender
(p16.0) LDL (w/v) was prepared in the laboratory following the method described by Moussa et al. [88]. They used poultry egg yolks to isolate LDL by ultracentrifugation [22,88]. Higher kinetic parameters were achieved using 2%, 4%, and 8% LDL compared with 20% whole egg yolk in a Tris-milk extender and can lower the concentration of LDL, such as 2% associated with skimmed milk, which can be used for buffalo semen freezing [89].
## (s20) Source of Energy
(p20.0) Energy intake is responsible for the continuation of development and the function of all living cells, and gametes are no exception. Two metabolic pathways are producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), that supplies energy for the main functions of sperm, which are oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis [123]. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of sperm cells and provides energy for sperm metabolism [123]. Sugar, such as fructose and glucose, is considered the primary energy source in sperm cells [124]. However, fructose is the best sugar for maintaining functional membrane integrity, adequate sperm motility, andtonic after thawing [125].
## (s22) Added Components of Plant Origin
(p22.0) There is an international demand for using natural medical sources in semen extenders of different animals [134,135], for example, strawberry [136], green tea [134], virgin coconut oil [30], pomegranate [135], and Pinus brutia [137,138], among others. The effects of several plant extracts on fertility have been demonstrated as antioxidants in many animal species due to their free radical scavenging properties [139].

(p22.1) According to the results of El-Sheshtawy [136], he used a 1%-5% concentration of strawberry in Tris extender and improved semen parameters in cooling temperature and used strawberry at 3-6% concentration, which improved semen parameters in freezing temperature for bull semen.

(p22.2) Researchers found that supplementation of Triscitric acid extender with 1.0% green tea improved sperm parameters in both in vitro and in vivo fertilization, which decreased lipid peroxidation in buffalo bull sperm freezing and thawing processes [134].
## (s24) Honey
(p24.0) Malik [133] found that adding honey to extenders significantly affected sperm motility before freezing and sperm abnormality of the freeze-thawed semen. Honey contains a high number of various simple sugars and antioxidants [140]. Furthermore, honey is also a highly concentrated product. It has a potential hyperosmotic extracellular environment around sperm cells that enhance the efflux of intracellular fluid, thereby minimizing the formation of ice crystals inside the sperm cytoplasm, which has been linked to sperm damage during cryopreservation [141]. This illustrated that using honey increased the quality of the semen after thawingcompared with using egg yolk extenders.

(p24.1) Yimer et al. [142] showed that adding honey to bull semen Tris extender at 2.5% was optimum to obtain improved semen cryopreservation results compared with Bioxcell ® . Another experiment [143] illustrated that adding d ifferent honey concentrations to extenders has various effects on the semen quality of different bull breeds. Jersey bull exhibited the best sperm quality compared with Mafriwal, Piedmontese, and Limousin bulls. Because El-Nattat et al. [144] considered that 1% concentration of honey additive to Bioxcell ® extender could be higher effectively when used in bull semen cryopreservation compared with Bioxcell ® only identified as a control.

(p24.2) Moreover, Fakhrildin and Alsaadi [141] showed that adding of honey to the freezing semen medium of humans at 10% concentration to semen extender resulted in enhanced sperm post-thawing quality of most sperm parameters.

(p24.3) In addition, researchers have reported the benefits of using honey as a supplement in the cryopreservation semen media of various animals, such as goat [145], which act as natural antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria, hinder sperm survival, fertilizing ability, reduce the number of dead abnormal sperm, and acrosomal damage. Some studies showed that using 2.5% honey might be an energy source to ram semen [146]. El-Sheshtawy et al. [147] illustrated that adding 3% of honey in extenders as a cryoprotectant improved Arab stallion post-thawing sperm parameters.
## (s27) Vitamin B 12
(p27.0) Adding Vitamin B 12 to the extenders improved bull frozen semen quality, elevated the motility percentage of sperm cells, and improved movement characteristics [68,86,160,161]. Researchers found that the addition of 2.50 mg/mL Vitamin B to semen extenders improved bull frozen semen parameters and quality [161]. Furthermore, oral administration of 200 mg/kg body weight per day of Vitamin B 12 could improve fresh and post-thawed sperm quality and fertility in male broiler breeders [159].
## (s28) Vitamin E
(p28.0) Vitamin E is a cellular stabilizer of unsaturated lipids against oxidative deterioration, and hence, it maintains the structural and functional integrity at the subcellular level [161,162]. In general, Vitamin E is the primary component of the antioxidant system in sperm cells [163,164]. Furthermore, adding Vitamin E to Tris-egg yolk extenders at 60 and 120 μM provides higher integrity to the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and kinematic parameters of sperm cells of rams [165], roosters [162], and bulls [164] post-cryopreservation.
## (s30) Other Additions
(p30.0) Several researchers have added various substances to semen extenders, such as milk, caseinate, and lactoferrin [120]. Other researchers added hormones, such as insulin [171], follicle-stimulating hormone [172], and testosterone [173], to the semen extenders. The addition of selenium improved male reproductive performance by potentiating semen quality and suppressing free radicals [174,175]. Selenium could decrease lipid peroxidation and increase antioxidants in rooster seminal plasma after the freezethawing process [176].
## (s31) Antibiotic addition to semen extenders
(p31.0) Antibiotics are added to semen extenders to reduce microbial contamination of the external environment or during semen collection. Different antibiotics, such as penicillin and streptomycin, ceftiofur, apramycin, and aminoglycosides or linco-spectin + tylosin + gentamycin, have been added to semen extenders [10].
## (s35) Sperm viability
(p35.0) The viability of sperm cells is an essential aspect of ejaculation quality that determines competitive fertilization success, proportional to live sperm [187]. Spermatozoal viability is essential for motility and fertilizing ability. Once sperm viability is reduced, their ability to induce fertilization is decreased [58,187]. The percentage of live sperm cells was determined in the laboratory by identifying the number of sperms that did not take up the eosin-nigrosin stain [14,58,187].
## (s36) Sperm morphology
(p36.0) Sperm morphology depends on spermiogenesis [188] or events that occur after spermiation [175]. Improper handling of semen samples because of lack of experience can cause challenges during the cooling and freezing processes. Furthermore, these challenges may lead to acrosomal damage and abnormality of sperm tails [189]. Sperm shape abnormality includes head defects, such as microcephaly and macrocephaly. Midpiece defects, such as proximal cytoplasmic droplets, distal midpiece reflexes, and segmental aplasia of the mitochondrial sheath, are common [190].
## (s37) Acrosomal Reaction
(p37.0) The study of acrosomal integrity in mammalian species is a valuable tool in evaluating male subfertility and infertility. With advancements in microscopic visualization and cell-staining technology, methods for determining acrosomal integrity have been developed. The acrosome reaction is an exocytotic event initiated when sperm binds to the zona pellucida of an ovum. Once sperm binding occurs, the outer acrosomal membrane fuses with the overlying plasma membrane of the ovum [194]. The fusion of these membranes triggers vesiculation, a process where many small vesicles are created that allows for the dispersal of acrosomal enzymes [195,196]. The release of acrosomal enzymes enables the sperm cell to digest its way through the zona pellucida and begin the process of fertilization [197,198].
## (s38) Importance of an Intact Acrosome
(p38.0) The ability of a sperm cell to undergo capacitation, acrosome reaction, and a fertilization event requires an intact acrosome at the time of ejaculation and after the freeze-thawing process. The disruption or damage to the acrosome is permanent and results in premature loss of acrosomal contents, ultimately preventing fertilization [199,200]. Moreover, damaged acrosomes do not undergo vesiculation properly but spontaneously rupture and defect fertilization in the end [199].
## (s40) In vivo Fertility Evaluation
(p40.0) It is crucial to examine the in vivo fertility test to provide comprehensive and perfect data. This test is considered the most important one for evaluating semen quality and provides information on the capability of sperm and pollination capacity of the ova after access to the female reproductive tract. Potential fertility depends on multiple parameters that require a multi-parametric analysis of sperm morphology, sperm motility, membrane status of sperm, sperm acrosome reaction, and genome integrity of sperm to provide a complete picture of a male's fertility potential. Moreover, the reliability of fertility prediction is reported to increase by combining several in vitro sperm quality parameters [180,181,203]. The difficulty of this assay is that it is a time-consuming and costly procedure as hundreds of successful inseminations are required.
