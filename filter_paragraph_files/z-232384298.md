## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Neural rehabilitation, to the extent this is possible, aims to restore the functionality of impaired neurological circuits or complement remaining functionality. This aims to enhance patient independence and quality of life through exploitation of neural plasticity [1,2]. Predominant focus of the neural rehabilitation field lies on restoration of sensorimotor control and functions. Neural plasticity is based on the hypothesis that central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) circuits can be retrained after a lesion in order to facilitate effective rehabilitation [3]. The main neural rehabilitation research approaches can be described as bottom-up procedures where, by acting on the affected limbs, one aims to influence the CNS; however, the exact afferent mechanisms of neuroplasticity behind this approach are still unknown [4]. Neural prosthetic grasping hands and legs, support exoskeletons, and body-weight support/robotic treadmill systems all share the bottom-up approach, where plasticity is driven by the device and by rehabilitation practice. Recently an emerging research trend is exploring top-down approaches as a new paradigm for exploiting neuroplasticity by first studying and modulating the state of the brain [4]. As such, rehabilitation is driven by said neuroplastic changes [4]. Brain-computer interfaces and virtual reality variants all fall in this category where neural plasticity is recruited to accommodate lasting rehabilitation effects. Additionally, there is a current focus on repetitive and intensive training; however, other principles of motor learning (such as transferability of learning to daily activities, active engagement, and problem solving) are not yet fully explored [5]. Due to its repetitive, intensive, and task-specific nature, robotics rehabilitation is a great candidate for integrating the abovementioned hypotheses for retraining the CNS [4,5].
## (s5) Amputation
(p5.0) Nearly 2.1 million people were living with amputation in the United States in 2019, which is 0.63% of the population, and that number is estimated to double by 2050 [69]. Worldwide estimations are not easy to collect largely due to the variability of what causes the amputation, as well as underreporting in less-developed countries [70]. Prosthetics and bionics are usually employed to assist people with amputation [7]. To secure an optimum prosthetic benefit for the traumatic amputees, we need to ensure prompt prosthetic fitting and proper rehabilitation in addition to post-traumatic counselling [71]. Important progress has been made over the past several years in creating prosthetic technologies aiming to restore human functions to those that suffer from the partial or full loss of their limbs [70]. Some of the advances that allow more amputees to have independent lifestyles are in sources of power and electronic controls, socket fabrication and fitting techniques, components, and suspension systems [72]. The rehabilitation for upper limb amputees has also benefited from technological advances such as myoelectric and proportionally controlled devices and elbow joints. For the lower limb amputees, some of the advances that are now used are ankle rotators, electronic control hydraulic knees, energy-storing feet, and shock absorbers [72].

(p5.1) Prosthetic types should be selected based on a patient's individual needs and preferences. There are indications that body-powered prostheses have benefits in durability, frequency of adjustment, maintenance, training time, and feedback, but control can still be further improved. Myoelectric prostheses are more well-established for light-intensity work, and they can improve phantom-limb pain and cosmesis [73].

(p5.2) However, many challenges remain, such as the complexity of neural changes after amputation and the still enigmatic fundamentals of motor control in amputees, to understand and address the barriers in patient adoption of technology [70]. Understanding how these critical factors work with device designs and emerging technology can have a great impact on the functional outcomes of patients with limb amputation [72].
## (s9) Human-Robot Control Interfaces
(p9.0) Human-robot control interfaces (invasive and noninvasive) are technologies that acquire, decode, and communicate the intention of a human user to a device via control commands ( Figure 3). Such a device can be a wearable exoskeleton or a prosthetic/bionic device [7]. The technologies mentioned in this section interface either directly (digital-neural interfaces) or indirectly (EMG interfaces) with the PNS or with the CNS (BCIs) [101,102]. Such technologies use a physical interface via electrodes that based on invasiveness can be discriminated into either implantable (applied directly at the brain/muscle/nerve) or surface (applied on the skin) devices [102]. Human-robot interfaces (HRIs) are interfacing the human (brain, muscle, and nerves) with a device by acquiring biological signals, decoding them, and translating them to control commands for various assistive, rehabilitation, or prosthetic devices.
## (s10) Digital-Neural Interfaces
(p10.0) Digital-neural interfaces are connections that enable two-way information exchange between the nervous system and the user ( Figure 3). Such interactions can occur at various levels, including interfacing among the peripheral nerves and the spinal cord, as well as the brain. In many instances, some of the fundamental biophysical and biological implementation challenges are shared across these levels. Furthermore, such interfaces can be either invasive-such as implantable microelectrode arrays [103]-or noninvasive, such as in the cases of EEG [104] and wireless interfaces. Interfacing with the neural system in an invasive manner for rehabilitation purposes can also be achieved with deeper brain sensing and stimulation. Robotic physical assistance has been converging with deep brain stimulation (DBS), leading to novel forms of neural engineering technology, although this field does not necessarily precisely fit the scope of neural rehabilitation [105].

(p10.1) Neural sensing and control interfaces used for the first time back in the 1960s were technologically primitive by modern standards and were mostly focused on prosthetics. Muscles were activated as a group, essentially reducing multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) to a single movement (e.g., grasping). In the decades that followed, several key technological advances relevant to neural rehabilitation have taken place. Fueled by rapid development in digital electronics, microcontrollers, signal processing, control and machine learning algorithms, robotics engineering advanced and synergistically converged with prosthetics engineering, leading to ever more sophisticated artificial limbs. Implantable wireless electronic devices subsequently appeared capable of transmitting signals directly to and from the PNS, avoiding the necessity to maintain an open skin wound. The prospect consequently appeared for mixed-signal assistive electronics to help bypass irreparable trauma to the nervous system by acting as signal amplifier, repeater, and filter.

(p10.2) Interfacing with the PNS via neural electrodes is considered one of the most promising ways to control sophisticated neuroprosthetics [102]. For direct physical interfacing with the nerves, there are two main types of electrodes-namely, extraneural (placed around the nerve) and intraneural (inserted inside the nerve) [101,102]. Extraneural electrodes include epineurial, helicoidal, book, and interfascicular electrodes (which are mainly used for stimulating peripheral nerves), and cuff electrodes, which are capable of both nerve stimulation and recording of neural signals [101,102]. Intraneural electrodes include intrafascicular, penetrative microelectrodes, and regenerative electrodes, which are used for both stimulation and recording [101,102].

(p10.3) At the point that this paper went to press, there is a technological trend toward wireless and less invasive implantable electrodes, as well as toward further shrinking the electrode contact features from the micron to the submicron scale (e.g., carbon nanotubes). Neural cuff electrodes with embedded electronics-which can handle wireless power, data transfer, and have adequate computing power for fundamental signal processing-is, in our opinion, one of the most promising sets of converging technologies. It can potentially provide selective, low impedance signal recording and stimulation without requiring an open skin wound for wire passage.

(p10.4) Despite the aforementioned technological advances, numerous challenges still remain in the application and widespread adoption of digital-neural interfaces. Frequently, significant compromises have to be made regarding the accuracy, response time, and number of degrees of muscle movement freedom [102]. Issues with the powering of neural implants as well as in the wireless transmission of data from and to the implants limit optimal control of external devices [102]. These control issues are further inhibited by the amount of selectivity and resolution that can be currently achieved by existing hardware [102]. Sensing and stimulation electrodes are often a weak link in the signal flow; thus, research and development in the past two decades have increasingly focused on the technological improvement of electrodes and sensors [106]. Additionally, the surgical procedures required to implant neural electrodes, as well as the physical properties of the materials comprising the electrodes, may result in an injury of neural tissue or rejection of the implants by the human body due to biocompatibility issues [102]. Last but not least, due to the novel nature and recent clinical application of implanted digital-neural interfaces, their long-term effectiveness, stability, and reliability are still unclear due to issues related to the longevity of the electrodes [102].
## (s15) Technological Challenges of Exoskeletons
(p15.0) Stroke patients who receive electromechanical gait training assistance in addition to physiotherapy are more likely to achieve independent walking [154]. Some of the roadblocks remaining for developing commercially successful lower limb (LL) exoskeletons are human-machine interface compliance, the optimization of the control algorithms, and the smooth coordination with the physiology of the human body with low metabolic energy expenditure [155].
## (s17) Neuroprosthetics
(p17.0) Prosthesis (a word that comes from Greek and means addition and attachment) is a device or system that replaces a missing body part to supplement its functionality [166]. Thus, a neuroprosthetic is a device (Figure 3) that interacts with the nervous system and supplements or restores functions in the user's body [167].
## (s18) Technological Challenges of Neuroprosthetics
(p18.0) The purpose of controlled neuroprosthetics is to transfer control intent from the central nervous system to drive the prosthetic devices of users with immobilized body parts [168]. Such control generally requires high levels of concentration by the patient and long training periods, often resulting in high rejection rates of prosthetics [129]. To accomplish robust control, there are two main challenges: (1) development of neural interfaces that last a long period, and (2) skillful control of the prosthetic device comparable to natural movements [168]. Up-to-date hand prostheses are actuated by advanced motors, allowing the restoration of fine motor skills with direct muscular signals connection [169]. In the long run, the goal is to accomplish a quantum-leap advance in neural controllable degrees of autonomy that should permit the user to perform tasks of daily living without effort [168]. Some points to consider regarding control and feedback are the location of the interface with the CNS and the PNS, as well as the invasiveness of the interface, from noninvasive interfaces to the most invasive interfaces requiring surgical implantation [170]. Surgical procedures, such as targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) [171][172][173] and osseointegration [174], greatly improved PNS signal decoding and subsequently improved prosthetic control, as well as the donning/doffing and stability of the prosthetic fixture. In TMSR, motor and sensory nerves of a severed limb are surgically rerouted to reinnervate regions of large intact muscles (the pectoralis for the upper extremity and the hamstring for the lower extremity [171][172][173]). Osseointegration is a surgical procedure where a load-bearing implant is directly integrated with the residual bone of the amputee to improve prosthetic connection and sensory feedback [174].

(p18.1) Regarding control, the key technologies used for interfacing prosthetics with an amputee are EMG, neural and BCI interfaces (interfacing directly or indirectly with the PNS), and body-powered and impedance/admittance control (interfacing with the residual/unimpaired anatomy of the user) [7,102,168]. The three key ways to interface with the PNS/CNS are described in Section 3.1. and are very popular with UL prosthetic control [7]. Impedance control manages the relation between position and force and is mainly applicable in LL prosthetics controlled by the multi-joint mechanical impedance. To control a prosthetic, it is equally important that the user can have a proper feedforward and feedback signal. This can be achieved via body-powered control methods that focus on the use of the remaining anatomy of the human to mechanically control a prosthetic limb [7]. Body-powered control can be complemented/combined with other approaches such as cineplasty, muscle bulging, myoelectricity, and myo-acoustics to create hybrid control interfaces for UL prosthetics. Additionally, FES based neuroprostheses (in the case of FES, the impaired existing limb is considered the prosthesis) can stimulate muscles or nerves [175,176] to elicit movement in the impaired limb and enable UL function restoration [177] and LL gait training [178]. FES can act as a standalone [177,178] or in combination with robotic exoskeletons [179].

(p18.2) Some of the most common decoding algorithms for neuroprosthetics control can be categorized as (1) independent models, (2) dynamic models, (3) reinforcement, and (4) classifiers. In the first category we have algorithms such as, Bang-Bang control, which is activated when a specific limit for a measured variable is reached, used in cases such as the delivery of cortical electrical stimulation [180] and the mapping of stimulus thresholds in high electrode count implanted neurostimulators [181]. A finite state machine contains the measurement of a system variable, which in combination with the modelled system's present state activates an action and a state shift [182] and is used in periodic functions such as the gait during walking. A population vector algorithm is based on the fact that there are directional preferences in different neurons [183], and it can be applied for the cortical representation of the arm motor control, encoding the lengthening or shortening of specific muscles. In the second category, there is the Kalman filter-which is a recursive optimum estimator and is mostly used for taking out signal from noisy measurements [184], variants of which have been proposed for neuroprosthetic closed-loop control to capture features of the neuroprosthetic task-and the point process filters-where the activity of individual neurons can be modelled as point procedures [184]. The reinforcement learning scheme may also be suitable to neuroprosthetic control in a real-life usage scenario where the task and related trajectory varies and accomplishing the task may be the only reinforcement signal offered [185]. Finally, in the last category are artificial neural networks, which are a data-driven method arranged in layers with neurons or nodes that can be used to achieve control of a myoelectric prosthetic hand [186], and support vector machines, which are supervised machine learning methods that can implement regression or classification.
## (s22) AI Algorithms for Human-Robot Interaction
(p22.0) Human-robot interaction (HRI) is a diverse research and development field that involves artificial intelligence, robotics, and the social sciences for the purpose of interaction and communication between humans and robots. It has a wide range of applications, such as industrial robots, medical robots, social robots, automated driving, search and rescue, and several more [216,217]. In this paper, the focus of HRI is on medical robots and, more specifically, in those employed for neural rehabilitation applications.
## (s23) AI Algorithms for Neural Signal Processing
(p23.0) With the growing complexity and scale of neural recordings, the role of neural signal processing has been gaining significance in the field of neurorehabilitation. The aim of neural signal processing is to process and analyze neural signals from which useful information and insights about the brain's information processing will be extracted and transmitted through neuronal ensembles. Reading out neural signals is significant to transmit neurofeedback to the brain or computer devices that support communication through brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) in neural engineering. Furthermore, assessing neural feedback, monitoring/decoding brain activity, and controlling prosthetics are key components for BMIs used in neural rehabilitation. Therefore, BMIs that are involved in robot-aided neurorehabilitation can benefit the most from increasingly accurate neural signal processing because of the significance of neurofeedback involved in neural therapies [232].
