## (s4) The brain-eye-vascular triad
(p4.0) Not only the eye-brain interaction but also their respective coaction with the cardiovascular system influences vision loss (Fig. 2) (Flammer et al., 2013a). For example, glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) was long considered to be a mechanical insult imposed by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) on the optic nerve head (ONH) resulting in ONH excavation and -secondarily -degeneration of the inner layer of the retina and of the optic nerve head. But this explanation is too simple for the following reasons: (i) GON involves the entire optic pathway including different brain structures to an extent larger than trans-synaptic degeneration would explain, (ii) GON can develop at either an elevated or a normal level of IOP, and (iii) occular blood flow (OBF) reduction is not confined to the eye but also happens in other body parts such as in nail fold capillaries and the brain, and this precedes the damage (Flammer et al., 2002). Fig. 2. The brain-eye-vascular triad. This triad illustrates the interdependency of the three organ systems and their role in vision loss. The retina, which transforms light rays to electrical cell signals weighs only about 1 gram. But the estimated weight of the brain areas needed to support normal vision is on the order of several hundred grams. To understand the causes and consequences of vision loss, and to find new treatment options, the eye and the visual system cannot be viewed in isolation but rather need to be considered within the holistic context of different systems throughout the brain and vascular system. The arrows indicate the direction of interaction between brain (b), vascular system (v) and eye (e). The eye-brain influence is denoted as E2B (eye-to-brain) and B2E (brain-to-eye or brain-to-central visual structures). Such interactions can be direct or indirect. Note: blood flow is not only important for delivering nutrition / oxygen and removal of metabolic by-products, but it is also important for thermo-regulation when the eye is exposed to extreme heat or cold. IOP is at least in part regulated by the brain. Fig. 3. Emotional stress and the "Flammer Syndrome". The term Flammer Syndrome (FS) describes a phenotype characterized by the presence of primary vascular dysregulation with a cluster of additional symptoms and signs. Symptoms and signs include the following: prolonged sleep onset time, prolonged blood flow cessation in the finger capillaries after cooling, disturbed autoregulation of ocular blood flow, increased prevalence of optic disc hemorrhages and activated retinal astrocytes, increased retinal venous pressure, increased stiffness of retinal vessels, higher spatial irregularities in retinal vessels, increased resistance in retroocular vessels, increased oxidative stress, altered gene expression as measured in lymphocytes, and altered activity of the autonomic nervous system (beat-to-beat variations of the heart).

(p4.1) The response to vascular challenges varies among individuals. It is influenced by environmental factors and genetic predispositions as exemplified by the Flammer Syndrome (FS). Such persons have a tendency to react differently (particularly with their blood vessels) to a number of stimuli such as coldness or emotional stress (Konieczka et al., 2014). Hence, we need to appreciate the important role of the brain-vascular interaction in vision loss.

(p4.2) Embryologically, the eye develops from brain tissue, and both blood flow (blood brain barrier) and cell types (neurons) are similar. But retinal vessels lack innervation by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the blood brain barrier is incomplete in the optic nerve head, rendering it more sensitive to circulating vasoactive molecules such as Endothelin-1. The term Flammer Syndrome describes a phenotype characterized by the presence of primary vascular dysregulation with a cluster of additional symptoms and signs. FS is protective against certain diseases such as arteriosclerosis but contributes to other diseases such as normal tension glaucoma (Konieczka & Erb, 2017).
## (s5) Emotions, mental stress and vision impairment
(p5.0) Many of the FS signs are quite typical also for the response to emotional stress which suggests that mental stress may not only be the consequence but also the cause of VI . In fact, in clinical practice many patients report that their vision loss occurred at the time of heightened or prolonged mental stress and anxiety. Hence, how stress affects the eye, optic nerve, and brain is an issue that should not to be ignored. On the one hand, the changes of beat-to-beat variations of the heart indicate an involvement of the autonomic nervous system (Kurysheva, Ryabova & Shlapak, 2018) and explain the response of the densely innervated retroocular vessels and the choroid to stress. On the other hand, vessels in and around the optic nerve become constricted by vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II, endothelin, or adrenalin which reduce blood flow during emotional excitement (Sossi & Anderson, 1983).

(p5.1) Indeed, FS patients have higher levels of the stress hormone endothelin (Flammer & Konieczka, 2015) and may suffer from AION under stress (Flammer et al., 2013b). The following accounts are anecdotal and meant to illustrate how acute stress can influence blood flow and vision loss. One of the authors (J.F.) saw three bankers who developed AION when the share-values on the stock market suddenly dropped and observed a 12 year old girl with AION after major school related stress. Another case was an opera singer who was examined with capillary-microscopy after exposing the latter patient to cold provocation which made the blood flow stop for 20 sec. When she later revealed her marital problems, blood flow stopped again for three minutes. That glaucoma is associated with psychosomatic components is supported by the observation that women showing FS signs (e.g. cold extremities, prolonged sleep onset latency) have a tendency to suppress anger because of stereotypic feminine gender socialization (van Arb et al., 2009), and normal-tension glaucoma patients show significantly more complaints and emotional instability (Erb et al., 1999).

(p5.2) Another frequent observation in the clinical context is that patients report their subjective impression that stress influences vision loss as they noticed the coincidence of a history of excessive mental stress and the time of their vision loss and worsening of the visual field during or after acute stress.

(p5.3) Thus, the striking resemblance of FS and psychological adaptation problems in response to emotional stressors suggests that VI may have an important, yet little appreciated, psychosomatic component. Stress is known to trigger autonomic respiratory and cardiovascular changes, and -from an evolutionary perspective -stress is adaptive to prepare for the "fight-or-flight" response. But long-lasting psychological stress unfavorably impacts the vascular system in the eye and brain as shown in both lab animals and humans. For example, acute or chronic stress can alter motor and sensory performance in laboratory rats (Metz, Schwab & Welzl, 2001), and cold hands in humans are one of the bodily reactions to mental stress (e.g. during job interviews, oral exams, or stage anxiety).

(p5.4) The reactivity to stressors is controlled by the brain, where the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) (Dampney, 2015) translates mental (psychological) states to a biological (medical) response. DMH receives neuronal input from emotional circuits of the cortex, amygdala, and other forebrain structures and mediates the cognitive and emotional appraisal by the brain, triggering a cascade of autonomic, respiratory, vascular and neuroendocrine responses. And there are phylogenetically ancient midbrain structures controlling the reflexive survival systems when exposed to sudden and threatening stimuli: the periaqueductal gray, the colliculi, and the basal ganglia that control the orienting and the cardiorespiratory responses. Known bodily reactions to stress include vessel contraction in the skin, skeletal muscles tension, and various visceral reactions. Blood vessel spasms can cause not only visual problems  but also sudden hearing loss, vertigo or stroke.

(p5.5) Thus, emotional stress may trigger the manifestation of vascular dysregulation in the eye and/or brain with subsequent increase of oxidative stress or may even lead to cell death (Shily, 1987). Clearly, there is a psychosomatic component to VI because the stress response has a remarkable, though indirect, influence on eye and brain vasculature. This, in turn, contributes to -or maybe even be the major causes of -vision loss , especially in AION or glaucoma (Flammer et al., 2013b). The remedy is to manage mental stress by relaxation exercises such as meditation and yoga which can reduce anxiety, normalize IOP, and improve blood flow (Backon et al., 1990;Shemagonov & Sidorenko, 2000;Chen et al., 2012;Tang, Holzel & Posner, 2015;Dada et al., 2018).
## (s8) Top-down control of residual vision
(p8.0) Whatever the cause of vision loss may be, the key question is how the brain can best handle residual visual signals when the damage is already done. According to the "residual vision activation theory" (Sabel et al., 2011b) residual (partially damaged) structures, for example in optic neuropathy, are disadvantaged in several ways: (i) partially damaged regions have fewer neurons which reduces physiological summation post-synaptically, (ii) their dysfunctional state comprises a perceptual "distraction" so that the brain preferentially allocates attentional resources to intact visual field sectors to reduce ambiguity, and (iii) their temporal processing is impaired due to desynchronized brain networks. In addition, there is remote damage beyond the injured region, and this magnifies the problem: (i) even presumably "intact" visual field sector have subtle perceptual impairments ("sightblind") (Bola et al., 2013) and (ii) long-range functional connectivity networks are disturbed as shown by EEG recordings (Bola, Gall & Sabel, 2015). This is compatible with reports of distant activation changes after local lesions as shown with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Marshall et al., 2008). Thus, not only "bottom-up" (retinofugal) but also "top-down" (cognitive/attention) brain mechanisms are part of the problem in vision loss of "eye" diseases.

(p8.1) One important "top-down" mechanism that modulates visual perception is attention. The brain has a natural tendency to direct its attention toward the intact visual field sector, "ignoring" the damaged sectors of the visual field to reduce ambiguity. This leads to "non-use" of residual structures near the scotoma which reduces their neuronal activity and synaptic transmission. But that such "neglected" residual structures can -in principle -be reactivated is suggested by the following observations: (i) lifting pressure from the optic nerve in Graves' orbitopathy (Gasser & Flammer, 1986) or from the chiasm following removal of a pituitary adenoma leads to rapid recovery of vision (Gnanalingham, Bhattacharjee, Pennington, Ng, Mendoza, 2005), (ii) focusing attention onto areas of residual vision (relative scotomas) in hemianopia instantaneously improves visual detection in the attended visual field sector (Poggel, Kasten, Müller-Oehring, Bunzenthal & Sabel, 2006a), (iii) daily attention training improves vision permanently (Poggel, Kasten & Sabel, 2004), and (iv) hemianopia patients with faster visual processing (reduced reaction time) in areas of residual vision show a microsaccade direction bias towards the intact hemifield .
## (s13) Reactivation of silenced cells
(p13.0) It seems a straight forward thought that after damage there are not only healthy and dying but also "silent" neurons. These silent neurons can be considered too healthy to die, but too sick to function normally. Activating these "silent" neurons could maximize potential for recovery. How could this be explained? When stimulation of neurons, i.e. by flickering light onto the retina, the neurons need to fire vigorously which requires additional glucose and oxygen. If this stimulation is not accompanied by appropriate upstream blood vessel dilation (because neurovascular coupling is impaired by vascular dysregulation (VD)), the neurons get "locked-in" a hypometabolic "resting" state and cannot rapidly fire action potentials and remain "silent". As discussed above, VD is found in many diseases and the question needs to be studied if, or to what extent, VD is ratelimiting for neuronal activation of "silenced" neurons and if this hypo-metabolic state can be reversed as a possible source of activating visual reserve.

(p13.1) The evidence for the existence of dormant (silent) neurons or neural networks is still rather indirect: (i) there is often a surprising degree of natural recovery in the early phase after the lesion (Sabel, 1999;Zhang et al., 2006) which cannot be explained by edema resolution or axon regeneration, (ii) residual vision can be improved by vision training, drugs or noninvasive brain current stimulation (discussed below), and (iii) functional connectivity networks of the brain can reorganize after damage (Gilbert & Wiesel, 1992;Bola et al., 2014) (see Table 1). This proposal of a hypometabolic state was already implied by experimental finding in glaucomatous monkeys that showed that optic atrophy is associated with a non-selective reduction of metabolism of neurons in afferent visual structures (Harwerth et al, 2002). Clearly, the concept of reactivating hypo-metabolic neurons as a basis for recovery has a certain charm because reactivated neurons have been involved in visual processing before and thus are pretuned to respond to visual stimuli.
## (s15) Brain networks, synchronization and amplification
(p15.0) Normal visual perception requires the interaction of many brain structures, not just the activity of a few local regions, such as the primary visual cortex. Vision is rather the product of both local and global mechanisms in the brain. Through complex interactions among different visual and nonvisual structures, conscious visual experience is the result of synchronized mental activity among these different systems (Uhlhaas & Singer, 2006), and its expression is dependent on visually-elicited (motor) responses and cognitive processing. As Palva and Palva (2017) point out, it is through neuronal oscillations of brain networks that synchronization between different brain areas takes place. This allows the coordination of neuronal communication in a distributed brain network, and it is by way of cross-frequency phase synchrony (coupling) that oscillatory activity of different phases and frequencies are coordinated to permit the interactions of different functions and modalities, linking, for example, sensory information with attentional and executive control.

(p15.1) What does that mean practically? Even a most simple dot detection task, as used in perimetry, involves the interaction of a host of different brain structures and functions: in the eye, on the one hand, photons are translated into neurophysiological impulses and pre-processed by retinal mechanisms, travelling through the optic nerve to the brain. On the brain-side, the situation is much more complex, because visual perception requires (i) sufficient vigilance (being "awake"), (ii) motivation ("I want to do the test"), (iii) attention to the task ("concentrate on detecting the target dots"), (iv) fixating ("keep your eyes steady"), (v) Gestalt perception ("identifying the shape of a dot"), (vi) visual memory ("remember the dot"), (vii) cognitive decision making ("it was the target") and, finally, (viii) a motor response ("move the finger to press the button"). Other modulating factors are (ix) anxiety, (x) responses biases, and (xi) response fluctuations (Flammer, Drance & Zulauf, 1984c) due to vascular status, time of day or even weather conditions (atmospheric pressure).
