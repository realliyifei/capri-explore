## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Proteins of resistance, in turn, identify distinctive elements of avirulence (Avr) which are not conserved between many pathogens. Induced-signaling resistance protein contributes to the manufacturing of reactive oxygen species and the induction of a particular form of programmed cell death, called the hypersensitive response, which damages the impacted cells (1). Also called gene-to-gene resistance is the resistance of protein-mediated innate immunity, as each R gene reacts to a particular pathogenic Avr gene (1). As a result, a big variety of R genes per plant genome are anticipated to be prepared to confer resistance to a wide range of pathogens. R genes are also under selection diversification to maintain pace with the fast pathogen evolution. Although distinct R genes react to very unique pathogens, they share multiple regions (domains) that have been conserved. R proteins can be split into four subclasses on the basis of these domains.

(p0.1) SNP markers have acquired a great deal of concern in the science and breeding society (2) over the past two centuries. They happen in nearly infinite amounts as variations between individual nucleotides and each SNP is a possibly helpful marker in single copy DNA. In the study of human genome, the potential of SNP markers is obviously illustrated. Several million SNP markers have been recognized (3) and techniques have been created concurrently (mainly up to 1 million) to evaluate big amounts of SNP markers based on huge study attempts and the complete description of the human genome.

(p0.2) As more genome sequences became accessible, comparative assessment of various genomes became a very significant research method. Compared to various genomes of selection, biological pathway assessment is conducted using a range of computational techniques and databases (4,5). There are a range of enzymes and their substrates and products involved in a biological pathway. Pathways also communicate with each other. Thus, comparison pathway assessment is quite complex and can hardly be achieved without well-designed software systems for pathway assessment (4). We review the concept of plant resistance genes, plant SNP markers and plant Genome annotation.
## (s1) Resistance genes
(p1.0) Most R proteins comprise a key nucleotide binding site (NBS) that functions as a molecular switch to regulate the protein's activity status, and a C-terminal, leucine-rich repeat region (LRR) needed to recognize Avr factor. Thus, the ranking of R proteins is focused on N-terminal domain variety (1). Drosophila Toll and human interleukin receptors categorized as TIR-NB-LRR proteins are homologous to NBS-LRR form R proteins with N-terminals. Non-TIR NBS-LRR proteins are known to as CC-NBS-LRR proteins since some non-TIR proteins in their N terminus form a coiled coil (CC) domain (6).

(p1.1) Furthermore, there are two categories of R proteins in their N terminus that contain an extracellular LRR. One of these groups, called kinases (RLKs) receptor, includes a kinase domain of cytoplasmic protein (7). This cytoplasmic protein kinase domain is also lacking in receptors such as proteins (RLPs). Since R genes from distinct plant species combine conserved domains, they could be used to monitor plant genomes for R genes and putative R genes (e.g., analogs of resistance genes, RGAs) and to generate molecular markers (7).

(p1.2) Meyers et al. (8) investigated a genome-wide assessment of 149 NBS-LRR processing genes in Arabidopsis and verified either 55 CC-NBS-LRR (CNL) or 94 TIR-NBS-LRR (TNL) proteins in two significant groups. Eight significant motifs varied in their deviation within and between CNL and TNL clusters, and in the model found in particular for plant R protein homologues. Introns may be more prevalent in cereals in the NBS region than in dicots. Only participants of the Arabidopsis Rpp8/Hrt gene class contain introns in the NBS domain in 20 named dicot NBS-LRR genes. Nevertheless, in their NBS region, Pib (9), Pi-ta (10) and Mla1 (11), three distinguished plant resistance genes have introns. Repeats rich in leucine (LRRs) consist of redundant incomplete amino acid sections that fold into solvent-exposed β-cell β-loop constructions and this domain is believed to be engaged in ligand binding and disease identification (12).

(p1.3) Alternating conservation motifs and hyper variance marked LRR areas. The variation is highest for codons (x) situated in the LRR consensus xxLxLxx around the two preserved aliphatic amino acids, and the number of LRR repeats ranges among family members. There were approximately 65 amino acids in TNL proteins between the NBS and LRR domains in the genome-wide assessment of Arabidopsis LRR domains (12).

(p1.4) In Arabidopsis, in CNL proteins, LRRs represent about half of the C-terminal region in the TNL proteins and almost the entire C-terminal region. The median domain of TNL LRR and CNL LRR comprised an average of 14 LRRs with ~10 separate MEME patterns spanning as many as 350 amino acids as possible. In the rice proteins, a total of 25 distinct LRR motifs have been recognized. In any one gene, the amount of LRR clusters varied from 3 to 40 (13) . There are more than 150 genes of NBS-LRR in the Arabidopsis thaliana DNA. A sum of 166 NBS-LRR sequences were mentioned in (13), along with 33 truncated sequences. These NBS-LRR genes happen in their chromosome layout as 51 singletons and 40 clusters. Meyers et al. (2003) identified more NBS-LRR mutations by using comprehensive manual re-annotation of the same species genomic structure. They identified 149 NBS-LRR genes as well as 58 truncated genes; spread as 40 singletons and 43 clusters were the 149 non-truncated genes.

(p1.5) In Arabidopsis thaliana, TIR-NBS-LRR genes family was detected out CC-NBS-LRR genes by approximately two to one, showing either a latest amplification of the former group or reduction of the latter gene group (13)(14)(15). NBS-LRR gene loci Arabidopsis are often not dispersed uniformly in the chromosomal genome. There are super groups on chromosomes 1 and 5 whereas chromosomes 2 and 3 were comparatively lacking in the genes of NBS-LRR (13,14). The clusters are believed to be engaged in both R-gene diversity generation and conservation.

(p1.6) Meyers et al. (14) noted that the NBS gene chromosomal allocation is substantially non-random in maize: chromosome 11 includes about one-quarter of the NBS genes. Five hundred and thirty-five NBS encoding genes have been recognized in rice, including 480 non-TIR NBS-LRR genes. TIR-NBS-LRR genes have been not detected in the rice genomic DNA. In 44 gene clusters, two hundred and sixty-three genes (51 percent) occurred. In the "clustered" allocation category, there are 40 pairs and 17 triplets, 394 genes. A total of 125 singletons of NBS have been distributed across all chromosomes. In the plant genome, the proportion of singletons to the complete amount of NBS chromosomes (24.1%) was comparable to that of Arabidopsis (26.8%).
