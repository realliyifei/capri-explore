## (s8) Summarizing the Issue in the Text
(p8.0) Summarizing is a proven strategy that can help students develop both their reading comprehension and writing skills (Mokhtari & Reichard, 2002). In addition to condensing information and identifying main ideas, summarizing provides an opportunity for students to practice paraphrasing, expand their vocabulary, and improve their writing fluency. Teachers can incorporate summarizing activities by asking students to summarize news articles or textbook chapters, or to summarize stories they have read in class. However, it is important for teachers to consider the language proficiency level of their students, as summarizing may be more beneficial for intermediate and advanced learners (Khoshsima & Rezaeian 2014;Chiu, 2015).
## (s9) Paraphrasing Short Texts
(p9.0) Several studies have shown the effectiveness of paraphrasing as a strategy for improving reading and writing skills in the ESL/EFL classroom. For example, Khoshsima & Rezaeian 2014(2011 found that paraphrasing activities helped students to better understand the main ideas and supporting details of a text, and to use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures in their writing. Similarly, (Choy & Lee, 2012). found that paraphrasing activities helped students to improve their comprehension and writing skills, and to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the content of the texts they read.

(p9.1) Paraphrasing is a useful skill that can help students improve both their reading and writing abilities in the ESL/EFL classroom. Paraphrasing involves restating a text in one's own words, while retaining the original meaning and intention of the text (Choy & Lee, 2012). It is a valuable technique for developing reading comprehension skills, as students must identify and understand the key ideas and supporting details of the text in order to rephrase them in their own words. Paraphrasing also enhances students' writing skills, as they must use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structures to convey the meaning of the original text (Na & Nhat, 2017;Flores & Lopez, 2019;Yahia & Egbert, 2023).

(p9.2) One effective way for teachers to incorporate paraphrasing into their ESL/EFL lessons is to provide short reading texts for students to practice with. These texts can be selected based on the students' proficiency level, and can range from simple news articles to more complex academic papers (Hirvela & Du, 2013;Chen, et al., 2015;Ruslan, et al., 2020). Students can then be asked to paraphrase the text in their own words, using appropriate vocabulary and grammar. This activity can help students develop their ability to identify the main idea and important supporting sentences in each paragraph of the text, which is essential for effective paraphrasing.

(p9.3) After several short text practices, the teacher can gradually increase the length and complexity of the reading texts to be paraphrased. This allows students to gradually build their skills and confidence in paraphrasing longer and more complex texts. Additionally, this activity helps students to expand their vocabulary and improve their writing style, as they must use appropriate synonyms and sentence structures to rephrase the original text (Escudero, et al., 2019;Hagaman & Reid, 2008).

(p9.4) Paraphrasing short texts is an effective strategy for improving both reading and writing skills in the ESL/EFL classroom. This activity provides students with the opportunity to practice their reading comprehension and writing skills in a structured and supportive environment. By gradually increasing the complexity of the texts to be paraphrased, students can build their skills and confidence in this important technique, and become more proficient readers and writers (Hagaman & Reid, 2008;Hirvela & Du, 2013;Chen, et al., 2015;Escudero, et al., 2019;Ruslan, et al., 2020).
## (s11) Comparing and Contrasting
(p11.0) One effective way to incorporate this approach in the ESL/EFL classroom is to ask students to compare and contrast the issue in the reading texts. This activity can help students develop critical thinking and analytical skills, as well as improve their writing ability.

(p11.1) To carry out this activity, teachers can select multiple sources related to a topic and provide them to students for reading. For example, if the topic is about environmental pollution, students can be given a news article, a scientific report, and a personal essay about someone's experience with pollution. By reading these different sources, students can compare and contrast the ideas presented in each text. They can identify similarities and differences, and then synthesize the information into a cohesive and coherent piece of writing. One study by Hammann & Stevens (2003). found that comparing and contrasting is an effective strategy for improving students' writing ability in the ESL/EFL classroom. In their study, EFL students were asked to write a compare and contrast essay about two short stories. The results showed that students who received explicit instruction in compare and contrast writing produced significantly better essays than those who did not receive such instruction.
## (s13) Project Based Learning
(p13.0) Project-based learning allows students to build their knowledge on a topic of interest and demonstrate it through a project. Prior to the completion of the project, students are required to read various sources, such as magazines, newspapers, research articles, manuals, and textbooks, in order to gain sufficient knowledge to undertake the project (Syarifah & Emiliasari, 2019;Nguyen, 2011;Lu, 2021). Moreover, Project-based learning provides an effective approach for students to improve their writing skills. Through this approach, students can build their knowledge and writing skills by engaging in various steps of the project. According to Argawati, & Suryani (2020),Nguyen,(2011, project-based learning provides students with the opportunity to engage in critical thiking, communication, collaboration, and creativity, which are essential skills for effective writing. Project-based learning also promotes motivation and engagement, as students are given the opportunity to explore and apply their knowledge in a meaningful and interesting way.
