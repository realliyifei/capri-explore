## (s7) Polluter-Pays Approach
(p7.0) The main reason that ocean dumping of sewage sludge was preferred to inland treatment/disposal methods was the minimal cost [10]. Therefore, the amount of ocean dumping can be controlled if the responsibility of the dumping party is increased in case of pollution; this summarizes the practical application of the LP's "polluter-pays principle". Perceiving its efficiency, the MOF also applied the principle by amending the Marine Environment Management Act to impose charges on ocean dumping of sewage sludge starting in 2006. The charge would increase if the dumping sewage sludge contained high concentrations of contaminants, and the imposed charges were deposited to the fisheries development fund that is used for marine environment improvement.
