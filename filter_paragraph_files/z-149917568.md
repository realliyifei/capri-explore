## (s5) students (across their 4 college years)
(p5.0) Hope, self-efficacy and engagement were correlated with the number of semesters and GPAs.Hope was the only factor that had unique effects when examining predictors and controlling for academic history.years of studies, while hope uniquely predicted the number of enrolled semesters as well (Gallagher, Marques, & Lopez, 2017).Furthermore, with regard to the two core components of hope (i.e., agency and pathways) the results showed that the agency aspect of hope predicted both skills and outcomes, while skills or outcomes also predicted agency, indicating that there is a two-way relationship among these variables (Sung, Turner, & Kaewchinda, 2011).Additionally, female students were found to score higher at hope than male ones, while the type of education (i.e., cooperative or traditional/non-cooperative) was not found to play an important role on the levels of hope (Drysdale, & McBeath, 2014).In the case of students with learning difficulties, hopeful thinking was found to have a significant mediation effect between learning difficulties and students' online avoidance coping.Particularly, students with learning difficulties who had hopeful thinking were less engaged in avoidance coping through the Internet compared to their peers without hopeful thinking (Sharabi, Sade, & Margalit, 2016).

(p5.1) Findings from the studies on hope and work-related variables indicated that hope was associated with employees' job satisfaction, performance, adaptivity, creativity, and feelings of efficacy and well-being.Particularly, hope was found to predict teachers' self-efficacy and perceived success (Sezgin & Erdogan, 2015), while changes in the levels of hope in psychotherapists mediated the effect of change in their well-being or their feelings of autonomy in work (Reis & Hoppe, 2015).Additionally, hope was found to have direct and indirect effects to career variables as well as to life-and job-satisfaction (Badran & Youssef-Morgan, 2015;Hirschi, 2014).More specifically, hope had a direct effect on college students' proactive career behaviors, which was partially mediated by a greater deal of career planning.Likewise, overall career development attitudes, such as plan- ning, decidedness and self-efficacy, mediated the effects of hope on students' life satisfaction.In the same study, hope had an indirect effect to employees' job satisfaction through career decidedness (Hirschi, 2014).Besides, hope, together with optimism, resilience and self-efficacy (i.e., PsyCap), were positively related to employees' job satisfaction (Badran & Youssef-Morgan, 2015).Along the same lines, in workers with intellectual disability, agency and pathways were mediators in the relationship between career adaptability and life (Santilli, Nota, Ginevra, & Soresi, 2014).
