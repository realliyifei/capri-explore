## (s2) Polymer Synthesis
(p2.0) An emerging area in biopharmaceutical research involves design and synthesis of on-demand biomaterial research (Williams, 2009) as they not only are important as drug carriers but also act as more complex systems who have the ability to interact with a number of biological systems invivo (Kohn et al., 2007).Technology transfer for biomaterial synthesis has been challenging due to inability to reproduce conditions during scale up (Armstrong et al., 2006;Danson et al., 2004) but with the advent of Microwave assisted technology synthesis or organic biopolymers has been accomplished which is reviewed in this section by focusing on mainly on two applications Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) and Poly caprolactone (PCL).Controlled solvent-free synthesis and modification in polymer materials can be rapidly and effectively done with the help of microwave heating using large scale reactors as identified in Figure 5 (Ebner et al., 2011;Guo et al., 2009;Iannelli & Ritter, 2005;Roy et al., 2009;Sosnik et al., 2010;Wang et al., 2008).

(p2.1) The biomedical applications of PLA, polyester have been extensively studied by the researchers.The first microwave assisted organic synthesis of d,l-Lactic Acid was carried out with SnOct as catalyst by using toluene as a solvent (Blokzijl et al., 1993).The end products were found to have 39-67 kDa of molecular weight and low polydispersity index (1.3-1.7)produced in a reaction time of 15 and 60 min, carried out under low power (85-170 W) and at isothermal conditions (130 째C).The reaction was later standardized by Wang et al. (2008) to produce Poly DL-Lactic Acid (molecular weight of 100 kDa) which as carried out under irradiation power (255 W) to obtained higher yields (90%) However, these conditions were identified to enhance the degradation of polymers needing further modification of the MAOS process.Following this study, the role of over-irradiation in developing the harmful effects in terms of both power and time on biopolymer production was focused (Sosnik et al., 2010).If the reaction is carried out under non-isothermal conditions, high rate of monomer degradation could be observed within six minutes (Kirschner, 1994;Ebner et al., 2011).

## (s3) Solid Phase Organic Synthesis
(p3.0) Advantages of microwave-assisted synthesis are mostly embodied in synthesis procedure under solid-state condition.With the use of microwave irradiation Besson, Guillard, and Rees (2000) carried out the multistep synthesis of thiazoloquinazolines in solution which has become a valid example for the application of microwaves to synthesize organic products in the presence of solvents.Compared with traditional solution-phase chemistry, solid-phase synthesis in the presence of microwave irradiation has gained increasing attention from practitioners of combinatorial chemistry due to some advantages, like simplification of reaction work-up and product isolation, affinity and specificity of reaction (Bremer, Szewczyk, Baird, & Dervan, 2000), rate-enhancements and the higher product yields (Larhed & Hallberg, 2001;Kirschning et al., 2001).

(p3.1) Stadler and Kappe (2001) used multimode microwave reactors in their study by attaching aromatic carboxylic acids to chloromethylated polymer-supported resins in the absence of solvent as identified in the following Figure 6.This cesium carbonate method has been carried out using microwave irradiation where in comparison to conventional heating methods, the microwave assisted methods were found to be more advantageous in terms of rate-accelerations, loadings and reaction time.In traditional method (heating at 80 째C) reaction time was 12 to 48 h while Microwave assisted heating at 200 째C and open glass vessels, led to a phenomenal decrease in reaction time of 5-15 min.In this case, the polymer-supported resins were not degraded even under prolonged microwave irradiation at 200 째C.Due to these advantages in terms of product yields and rate-enhancements in relation to conventional method, most of the practitioners prefer to use microwave-assisted solid-phase organic synthesis in organic combination industry making it a popular technique among practitioners.

(p3.2) Figure 6.Microwave-assisted solid-phase organic synthesis (Kappe, 2002) The above figures shows the process where there is attachment of carboxylic acid to chloromethylated PS resins by making use of the caesium carbonate method following which there is cleavage of N-acytelated amino acids which are attached to the resin.Finally there is microwave supported substitution of chlorine atom in the monochlorotriazines.

## (s5) Automated Library Generation
(p5.0) Parallel set-ups are useful to carry out a microwave-assisted chemical reaction within a short timeframe.However, there will be limited control over each reaction vessel regarding temperature/pressure.Each reaction vessel will be kept under same irradiation conditions in parallel set-ups.The reaction temperature is found to be associated with dielectric properties of solvent.So it is necessary to use same amount of identical solvent in each vessel so as to maintain temperature (Gabriel et al., 1998).The process of automated library generation is a viable alternative to parallel processing.
