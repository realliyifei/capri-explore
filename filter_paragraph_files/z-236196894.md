## (s0) Accumulation
(p0.0) After the bacteria-surface attachment, the next step is accumulation, a procedure referring to bacteria-tobacteria adhesion. Bacteria produce a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which has a critical role in biofilm formation [20]. PIA is encoded by the icaA-B-C-D operon's genes and is negatively regulated by the icaR [21]. It is a homopolymer of Î²-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues that enhances the accumulation phase and helps them avoid phagocytosis from the host's immune system [22].

(p0.1) Even though PIA seems to have a critical role in the accumulation phase, not all biofilms are PIA-dependent. Besides, many bacterial species can accumulate due to several transmembrane proteins in a PIAindependent model [23].

(p0.2) S. epidermidis biofilms are studied in-depth due to the ica gene locus regulation. Even though the expression of the ica operon has been firmly associated with the ability of S. epidermidis to form a biofilm, such a biofilm includes PIA-producing colonies and PIA-negative ones [24]. Additionally, many studies have proved that S. aureus biofilms are not strictly based on PIA production [25], and other proteins, such as the accumulation-associated protein (Aap), biofilm-associated protein (Bap), and FnBPs [7,26], play a major role in these biofilms.
