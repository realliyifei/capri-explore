## (s1) Methods
(p1.0) We systematically reviewed the medical literature to evaluate the current evidence on the risk of HCA-TB transmission from HCWs. We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement as a reference document for reporting our findings [11]. The review protocol is available on request from the authors.
## (s9) Meta-analysis
(p9.0) The quantitative analysis included 28 [13][14][15][16][17] individual studies for which the proportion of active cases or of infected individuals could be computed separately for infants (up to 24 months), children, adult patients, and/or HCWs.

(p9.1) Combined proportions of active TB cases among exposed individuals were: 0.11% (95% CI 0.04-0.21) for infants (Fig 2A), 0.38% (95% CI 0.01-1.60) for children (Fig 2B), 0.09% (95% CI 0.02-0.22) for adults ( Fig 2C) and 0.00% (95% CI C.I 0.00-0.38) for HCWs (Fig 2D).

(p9.2) Combined proportions of individuals who acquired TB infection were: 0.57 (95% CI 0.00-2.02) for infants (Fig 3A), 0.90% (95% CI 0.40-1.60) for children (Fig 3B), 4.32% (95% CI 1.43-8.67) for adults ( Fig 3C) and 2.62% (95% CI 1.05-4.88) for HCWs (Fig 3D). The combined proportion of infants with TB infection was 0.28% (95% CI 0.07-0.65) if the only study (29) in which IGRAs were used to detect LTBI is excluded.
