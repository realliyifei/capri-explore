## (s7) The Role of Values in Alternative Systems
(p7.0) It should be stressed that there are societal interests in agricultural practices and their consequences pose a challenge to agricultural science.There is also a need to rethink the general methodology of agricultural research as well as reconsidering the role of values in science, since values play, and ought to play, an important role in science.In addition, the role of values is particularly evident with regard to organic farming, because special values and goals play an obvious and decisive role here, and because these values are clearly different from the values of mainstream agriculture [48,49].We should not overlook the role of standard setting bodies and that there is a relationship between standards and values.It is important to realize that in the eyes of organic farmers, organic farming is based on fundamental values regarding nature, the environment, food production, farming and society.The basic guidelines or standards are thus attempts to find means that may help realize these values.Therefore the standards should be seen as temporary attempts to realize the values.Therefore, it is logical that guidelines should change over the years, allowing the basic ideas of values to be fulfilled in a better way.It is important to acknowledge the values of organic farming [25].The social element involved in the organic livestock issue is very important.The organic market provides room and resources for social movement activity, and could be a catalyst for positive political and social change.In addition, the growing organics business can be a source of funds for activities such as research [16].Furthermore, it allows everyone involved in organic farming a quality of life, which meets their basic needs, including adequate returns, work satisfaction and a safe working environment [25].
## (s8) Commenting on the "Conventionalization" Hypothesis
(p8.0) The conventionalization debate on organic farming was first surfaced by Buck et al. [52], following a study of the California organic sector.Various researchers all over the world took part and placed themselves on this debate [53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60].In particular, Lockie and Halpin [56] as well as Hall and Mogyorody [53], stated that conventionalization of organic farming does not exist in Australia and Ontario, Canada, respectively, whereas Best [59] reported that this situation operates to some extend in Germany.Furthermore, Guthman [50] quoted that several farms in California were abandoning the more sustainable and marketing practices of organic agriculture.

(p8.1) Darnhofer et al. [61] produced recently an excellent and comprehensive review on the critical issue of conventionalization of organic farming practices.These authors analyzing the subject, mentioned that according to the conventionalization hypothesis, organic farming is becoming a slightly modified version of modern conventional agriculture, replicating the same history, resulting in many of the same social, technical and economic characteristics.These changes, among others, involve larger farms or more purchased non-farm inputs and resource substitution.These mechanisms have been noted both at the farm level as well as in the processing and marketing of the organic products.

(p8.2) Lockie et al. [51] reviewed the issue of case studies carried out to test the conventionalization hypothesis of organic agriculture in various places over the world.These researchers concluded that studies by Hall and Mogyorody [53], Lockie and Halpin [56], Jordan et al. [57] show that, among others, concentration and input substitution occur to a significant extent.In addition, case studies carried out in Europe, report trends and practices on organic farming that could indicate conventionalization process.In particular, the size of organic farms is increasing in Denmark [55] and Germany [59].Flaten et al. [62] report, for later entrants in Norway, intensification of milk production due to a higher use of concentrates.In addition, Best [59] considers that later entrants in Germany, appear to be relatively less concerned about the environment.It is also interesting to know that De Wit and Verhoog [58] report conventionalization trends in organic pig and poultry production in the Netherlands.In this way, either in Europe or elsewhere, some organic farms employ such practices, which may not be sustainable, but are not explicitly prohibited by the standards [63].

(p8.3) In this sense, Darnhofer et al., [61] instead of using structural criteria to study the organic farming conventionalization practices, as it is done mainly by economists, they follow a sociologist's direction of assessment based on the organic principles and all these at the farm level.They argue that a number of -symptoms‖ that have been used to identify conventionalization at farm level, may not be reliable indicators, so they are not well suited to achieve a comprehensive assessment of the type and direction of changes to organic farming.They suggest instead the planning of assessment based -on the principles and values‖, which constitute the foundation of the system to check the -level of conventionalization‖ on individual organic farms and define various indicators and criteria to capture the changes.
