## (s2) Description and Life Cycle of Cylas Species
(p2.0) Adult females of the Cylas species usually lay their oval, yellowish eggs singly in sweetpotato roots or stems.They then seal the cavity with a fecal plug [23].Cylas spp.usually prefer to lay their eggs within the roots, mostly near the roots' crown.The egg stage lasts between 5 and 12 days, with C. puncticollis eggs maturing much quicker than those of C. brunneus [24].The larvae of Cylas spp.are usually curved in shape and white in color, Insects 2023, 14, 837 3 of 15 feeding and developing within the stems and roots of sweetpotato.The pupae are glabrous in shape, with those of C. puncticollis being relatively larger than those of C. brunneus [23] (Figure 1).Male and female adults of both Cylas species can be distinguished using the shapes of their distal antennal segments, notably filiform in males and club-like in females [16].The two Cylas species differ in their morphology, coloration, and general development (Table 1).
## (s23) Genetic Transformation for Weevil Resistance
(p23.0) Research has been conducted in SSA to develop varieties that are resistant to SPWs through genetic transformation and crossing landraces with transgenic cultivars.One of the first transformations in sweetpotato was for weevil resistance.Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was used to introduce the delta endotoxin gene cry8Db, which was obtained from Bacillus thuringiensis, into the sweetpotato cultivar "KB1" [61].This gene encodes a protein that is insecticidal and fatal to many insect larvae.A total of 21 lines were later regenerated from the calli that had been transformed.Upon testing, these lines later displayed a lower weevil infestation compared to those that were not transformed [81].Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was also utilized to transform the Ugandan sweetpotato landrace "Kyebandula" by introducing the genes for the bacterial endotoxins cry7A1 and cry3Ca.Positive PCR findings purportedly showed that the procedure was successful.Nevertheless, the transformed calli were later unable to develop into whole plants [82].
