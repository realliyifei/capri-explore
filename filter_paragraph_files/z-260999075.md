## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A activity, which results in the intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its derivatives [1,2].The accumulation of Gb3 and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3, which is the deacylated form of Gb3) in various cells is responsible for the general clinical manifestations of Fabry disease, i.e., acroparesthesia, angiokeratoma, anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, cornea verticillata that appear in childhood, and renal, cardiovascular, and/or cerebrovascular complications that onset in adulthood.
## (s1) ERT for Fabry Nephropathy
(p1.0) Three formulations of recombinant human αGalA are currently available: agalsidase α (Replagal ® ), agalsidase β (Fabrazyme ® ), and a biosimilar of agalsidase β (JR-051).Agalsidase α is produced in a human cell line and is dosed at 0.2 mg/kg every other week.Agalsidase β is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is dosed at 1.0 mg/kg every other week.These two forms of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have identical biochemical properties and are comparable with respect to amino acid composition, but they exhibit differences in glycosylation composition and in the levels of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR)-mediated cellular uptake [12].Lysosomal enzymes are incorporated into the kidney and heart via MPR on the plasma membrane, whereas asialoglycoprotein receptors are involved in the uptake of lysosomal enzyme in the liver [13].

(p1.1) According to a multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted by an independent international initiative to compare clinical outcomes of these two enzymes, there was no significant difference in the slope of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between agalsidase α and β treatment in patients with a baseline eGFR ≥ 60 mL or ≤60 mL, and similar rates of clinical events were observed for the two types of enzyme treatment: renal events, chronic kidney disease (CKD) G5, eGFR < 15 mL/min, renal transplantation or dialysis; cardiac events, implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker; cerebral events, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); and death from any cause [13].However, long-term ERT is associated with the formation of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) which decrease the effect of ERT by changing the catalytic activity of the enzyme and cellular uptake and accelerating decline in renal function.A significant increased risk for the formation of ADAs in male patients was demonstrated in patients treated with agalsidase-β compared to agalsidase-α.As for the influence of ADAs on renal function, Lender et al. demonstrated that a not saturated ADAs status (ADAs excess against infused enzyme dose) during infusion is associated with decreased renal function and reduced plasma lyso-Gb3 levels.The presence of ADAs was associated with a less prominent decrease in lysoGb3 following ERT in patients treated with agalsidase α, whereas the decrease in lysoGb3 after the initiation of ERT was minimally affected by the presence or absence of antibodies in patients treated with agalsidase β [14].

(p1.2) The effects of reducing the ERT dose and of switching from agalsidase β to agalsidase α have been investigated: in the agalsidase β dose-reduction group, the renal function decreased significantly (by ~3 mL/min) between the baseline and 1-year follow-up visit, and in the switch group, the rate of microalbuminuria was higher, with an albumin-tocreatinine ratio of 114 mg/g at baseline and 216 mg/g at the follow-up visit [15].After this study, the same research group assessed the changes in the eGFR and the albumin-tocreatinine ratio during (i) treatment with the standard dose of agalsidase β, (ii) ERT dose reduction, and (iii) a subsequent switch or a direct switch to agalsidase α after 2 years of observation [16].The eGFR values of the patients within the regular-dose group remained stable between baseline and the 2-year follow up, whereas the annual change in the eGFR was −3.74 mL/min in the dose-reduction switch groups and −2.45 mL/min in the direct switch group.The albumin-to-creatinine ratio did not differ between baseline and the 2-year follow-up in any of the three groups [16].JR-051 is also produced in CHO cells and has a primary structure that is identical to that of the original agalsidase β, a similar charge isoform profile, and similar glycosylation profiles as well as enzyme activity [17].In a Gla-knockout Fabry murine model, JR-051 reduced the accumulation of Gb3 in the kidney, heart, skin, liver, spleen and plasma, and there were no safety concerns regarding JR-051 in a 13-week evaluation using cynomolgus monkeys [18].JR-051 was developed in Japan by JCR Pharmaceuticals and is available in Japan.
## (s5) JR-051, a Biosimilar of Agalsidase β
(p5.0) A multicenter, single-arm, phase II/III clinical study (n = 16) following patients for 52 weeks was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of the agalsidase β biosimilar JR-051 in patients with Fabry disease in Japan.[15] The eGFR values at baseline, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks were 87.3 mL/min, 93.7 mL/min, and 89 mL/min, respectively.There was no apparent change in the patients' eGFR during the follow-up period.
## (s6) Chaperon Therapy for Fabry Nephropathy Migalastat
(p6.0) The pharmacological chaperone migalastat was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2016 and the U.S. Food Drug Administration in 2018 for the treatment of Fabry disease in patients with an eGFR > 30 mL/min and a mutation that is amenable to migalastat.It is estimated that approx.30-50% of individuals with Fabry disease have amenable mutations to migalastat [41].

(p6.1) In a randomized double-blind migalastat and placebo study conducted for 6 months and a continuous open-label study of 6-to 12-month migalastat treatment, i.e., the FACETS trial [41] of Fabry patients who had mutant α-agalsidase genotype that are suitable or not suitable for migalastat therapy, there was no significant difference in the annualized change in the eGFR form baseline to month 6 (stage 1) between the migalastat group (baseline eGFR: 94.4 mL/min) and placebo group (baseline eGFR 90.6 mL/min).In the patients followed up throughout 24 months of migalastat treatment, the mean annualize changes in the eGFR from baseline to the 24-month timepoint was −0.3 mL/min.Regarding the effect of proteinuria, there were no significant differences in the baseline levels of the groups' 24 h urinary protein excretion or in these values' changes from baseline to the last observation period.The primary endpoint of that study [42] was the percentage of patients who achieved a response (>50% reduction in the number of Gb3 inclusions per kidney interstitial capillary at 6 months).In addition, 13 (41%) of the 32 patients who received migalastat and 9 (28%) of the 32 patients who received the placebo showed a response, with no significant difference between the groups.However, a post hoc analysis of the patients with stage I CKD and a prespecified analysis of the stage II CKD patients with a suitable mutation (n = 45) showed a significantly greater reduction in the mean number of Gb3 inclusions per kidney interstitial capillary.
