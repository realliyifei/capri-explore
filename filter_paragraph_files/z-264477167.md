## (s1) RESEARCH METHOD
(p1.0) A systematic approach with a meta-analysis research method was used in this literature review.The systematic approach determined whether the learners' conceptual understanding problem was consistent across all studies and discovered which future studies were needed to solve problems.The following process identified any empirical evidence that met the pre-established inclusion criteria to address a research question or assumption [37]- [39].Since this paper required any information on a topic or evidence to support a hypothesis aimed at conceptual understanding of research data, crucial stages were needed in writing the review [40], [41], they are: i) Identify research questions; ii) Identify relevant studies; iii) Select studies; iv) Table findings; and v) Summarize and report on findings.The analysis followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis or known as PRISMA process for article review and selection, that is shown in Figure 1 [40], [42].

(p1.1) A total of 86 records focusing on solutions topics were retrieved through the database journal search.The other six records were retrieved through learning outcomes of the 1st-3rd grade undergraduate students.From the manual review of the articles' titles and considering the duplication, there were leaving 69 records in the identification step.The screening stage was conducted by reviewing the abstract of solutions' articles.The records that passed the screening process should contain the types of alternative conceptions or misconceptions the research subject owns.The process obtained 57 records regarding alternative conceptions and misconceptions on solutions learning material (factors affecting solubility, solutions of electrolyte, colligative properties, and colloids).In the advanced screening process, 12 records were excluded and 45 records of colligative properties topics were left to the eligibility round.The 45 records selected for the ISSN: 2089-9823 

(p1.2) The learners' conceptual understanding: Literature review of vapor-pressure lowering … (Rizki Nur Analita) 643 eligibility round were full-text reviewed until obtained the specific topic.After all, the full-text review excluded 32 records and included 13 records of articles based on perceived fit to eligibility criteria.

(p1.3) Figure 1.PRISMA flowchart for retrieval process [40], [42] The final selected articles focus on the learners' conceptual understanding of vapor-pressure lowering and boiling-point elevation.The review may provide insight into unfamiliar research and reveal what has been done well [43].The paper was produced as a preliminary stage for a further research project on colligative properties, especially in vapor-pressure lowering and boiling-point elevation concepts.Moreover, this can also be a source of further research on alternative conceptions about freezing-point depression and osmotic pressure.

(p6.0) Another research conducted by Kirbulut and Beeth [57] pointed out the concepts of the United States high school students using a phenomenological method with interview.The result indicated that students had inconsistencies in linking theoretical principles related to the concepts with daily phenomena.Related to Coştu et al. [58] findings, students in Turkey had been taught the fundamental concepts studied in evaporation.Revealing the students' ideas, predict-discuss-explain-observe-discuss-explain or PDEODE teaching strategy were used.After all, they still did not have a thorough understanding of how they relate to each other, nor did they routinely invoke their understanding of evaporation concepts.
## (s7) Alternative conceptions about vapor-pressure lowering and boiling-point elevation in pre-service and prospective chemistry teachers
(p7.0) The latter alternative conceptions occurred in pre-service and prospective chemistry teachers.Yalcin [16] discussed the survey findings of pre-service primary science teachers in Turkey.The research on the phase transition of water revealed that they had an insufficient understanding and common alternative conceptions of vaporization and any effect related to temperature and pressure.The results indicated that preservice teachers' understanding of the learning material concept was relatively low, and they held some alternative conceptions.None of them used a microscopic representation approach or phase diagram of water to solve the problems or tests.

(p7.1) One predecessor research conducted by Canpolat et al. [59] investigated Turkey's prospective teachers' alternative conceptions of vaporization and vapor pressure.The results reflected that the general view of prospective teachers did not gain the concept meaningfully.In the advanced research about boilingpoint elevation [26], it was noted that there were significant learning gaps at the conceptual level among prospective teachers.In another study, Tümay [29] investigated their mental model of vapor pressure.Three faulty mental models were found as a result.Those faulty mental models indicated the participants' alternative conceptions of either entities or their properties and relationships in the system.Here is Table 2 that selected and depicted the alternative conceptions held by pre-service and prospective chemistry teachers.A liquid must be heated to vaporize, and the maximum temperature is 100°C

(p7.2) Liquid will vaporize when the partial pressure of water in the air is less than the saturated vapor pressure of the environment.Meanwhile, water will boil when the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, typically at 100°C [16], [59] 2.
## (s8) Vaporization starts with boiling or else, liquid boils because of vaporization
(p8.0) Vaporization starts when the partial pressure of water in the air is less than the saturated vapor pressure of the environment.The boiling point of a liquid is reached at a specific temperature when the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the vapor pressure of the atmosphere [59], [60] 3.In the equilibrium system with a constant volume, the temperature change has no impact on the quantity of liquid or vapor Liquid-vapor equilibrium in a closed container tends to reestablish at a certain point, and the amount of vapor varies according to volume or temperature [16], [29] 4.
## (s9) The boiling-point elevation occurs because of the interaction between water and salt particles
(p9.0) The boiling-point elevation occurs between every particle in the solution: solute-solute particle, solutesolvent particle, solvent-solvent particle [26]  The change in boiling temperature of higherdensity liquids would be larger than that of lower-density liquids
## (s11) Teaching implications in vapor-pressure lowering and boiling-point elevation
(p11.0) In almost all science majors, colligative properties of solutions were one topic in an introductory chemistry course.Within the course of implementation, the learners' alternative conceptions of vaporpressure lowering and boiling-point elevation were often found.The summarized alternative conceptions included understanding the concept of vapor pressure correlated to the molecular illustrations of the evaporation and condensation, boiling point and its process, the effect of electrolyte and nonelectrolyte materials on the solvent, and molecular forces between particles of the solutions.Since the concept of colligative properties was built upon the fundamental principles of the particulate nature of matter, this understanding of behavior at any level (macroscopic, submicroscopic, algorithmic) appeared important in understanding subsequent concepts in chemistry.

(p11.1) A lot of studies revealed students had struggled in understanding colligative properties, yet still held several alternative conceptions, although they had learned the particulate nature of matter concepts.These alternative conceptions seemed to resist attempts to change them over time, despite heightened education in chemistry.Students passed from one year to another without completely understanding the fundamental concepts, especially in vapor-pressure lowering and boiling-point elevation.Rectifying the learners' alternative conceptions was a crucial step to take, not only for students, but also for pre-service and prospective teachers.Being aware of and concern for alternative conceptions in the topic allowed researchers to anticipate some of the challenges for not only students, but also teachers may face.

(p11.2) After the learners' alternative conceptions on vapor-pressure lowering and boiling-point elevation in the reported literature were investigated and presented, a couple of suggestions for teaching were made.For each result found, the recommended learning can be specifically different.Indonesian high school students experienced difficulties due to electrolyte, nonelectrolyte solution, and solution mixture [27].From the ISSN: 2089-9823 
