## (s1) Prey detection in birds of prey
(p1.0) Quite a lot is known about the ability of birds of prey to perceive UV radiation.Some species are known to use UV reflectance in their food strategy.Foraging birds may use either UV cues (reflectance or absorbance) of food items or UV cues of the environment.This ability was experimentally studied in the common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus).Kestrels are able to recognize vole trails (mainly Microtus arvalis, Microtus agrestis and other usual prey) by perceiving the UV reflectance of scent marks.These marks from vole urine appear in UV radiation as yellow.The question of whether the use of scent marks in the UV range is an innate feature or if it is acquired by experience was tested by Zampiga et al. (2006) in experiments on adult and juvenile individuals.The authors deduced that the association between vole scent UV reflectance and the presence of voles is an innate component, but that the ability to detect UV cues is a learned component.The ability to use UV reflectance in food strategy has been demonstrated not only in birds of prey (birds of order Falconiformes), but also in carnivorous birds of other orders, e.g., order Passeriformes.The results of experiments on the great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor) indicate that this passerine probably uses UV cues to determine the presence of voles (Probst et al., 2002).However, the ability to detect prey is common for birds with analogous feeding spectra in taxonomically distinct species.In many areas, there are fluctuations in small rodent (mainly voles) populations between years (usually over a four-year period).Viitala et al. (1995) examined the reaction of common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) to small rodent population density in northern Europe.The results of laboratory and field experiments on the common kestrel and the vole Microtus agrestis explain how raptors detect patches of high vole density without prior knowledge of rodent quantity as a food resource.Kestrels flying over landscape follow the vole marks -urine and faeces -that are visible in the UV light in order to assess the numbers of prey.The ability to follow these marks of the presence of voles enables the raptors to screen large areas in a relatively short time.

(p1.1) The same ability was demonstrated for the rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus) (Koivula and Viitala, 1999).During field experiments in northern Finland, these buzzards were observed more often in localities with vole marks.It is evident that they use these marks in choosing the prey hunting and breeding area.
## (s2) Food detection by other birds
(p2.0) UV perception and its importance in foraging have also been studied in predominantly herbivorous bird species.A possible UV sensitivity of the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix -Order Galliformes, Family Tetraonidae) is indicated by the results of laboratory experiments on these birds.Black grouses preferred UV-reflecting bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) to two colour morphs of bilberry (UV-reflecting and non-UV-reflecting); no preferences were observed in the absence of the UV light (Siitari and Viitala, 2002).The above observation was made in northern habitats (e.g., tundra and taiga).It is consistent that similar strategies occur in habitats with maximally wide biodiversity -tropical rainforests.

(p2.1) The significant role of UV reflectance in relations between plants and frugivores was demonstrated by Altshuler (2001), who tested the reflectance spectra of fruits from 57 tropical plant species on Barro Colorado Island in Panama.UV-reflecting fruits were present in both open and closed light habitats and were strongly associated with the occurrence of birds and rodents, both of which perceive UV radiation.A key fact is that only mature fruits reflected the UV -it is a visual signal for frugivore birds or other frugivores.The understorey shrub Psychotria emetica (Family Rubiaceae) was chosen as an example for an experimental study on the removal of fruit.During a 3-month period, the ambient light was manipulated by placing a UV-absorbing filter over fruiting plants, with control treatments of plants under clear filters (UV-transmitting) and plants without filters.Fewer fruits were removed from shrubs under the UV-absorbing filter, showing that UV reflectance can be an important attractant for the consumption of some fruit (and dispersal of its seed).This study establishes a relationship between the perceptual abilities of animals (including frugivorous birds as an example of animals finding their food by visual sense) and the colour of the fruits they consume.

(p2.2) Experiments have also been carried out on free-flying crows (Corvus ossifragus) under the seminatural conditions in an aviary.The important result of these experiments was that the discrimination of coloured objects (e.g., fruits) by birds can be influenced by the background.Thus, experiments on colour perception can be improved by incorporating background-specific effects (Schaefer et al., 2006).The experimental crows detected red fruits at a larger distance than black fruits.Artificial red fruits had higher chromatic and lower achromatic contrasts against foliage than artificial black fruits, so the crows apparently prioritized chromatic contrast.The colour change in the fruit colour from red to black during ripening thus does not increase attractiveness to the crows.The crows were also tested against two types of black berries (Vaccinum myrtillus): UV-reflecting berries and black blueberries, against backgrounds of foliage and against backgrounds of sand.In the first case -against foliage -the crows detected the UV-reflecting berries at a larger distance, because these fruits had higher chromatic and achromatic contrasts.Against the backgrounds of sand, the UVreflecting berries had low achromatic contrasts and black berries had low chromatic contrasts.As the crows detected both black berry types equally, they apparently used chromatic contrasts to detect the UV-reflecting berries, and the achromatic contrasts to detect the black berries.

(p2.3) Other studies have been carried out in the frequent bird model, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata -Order Passeriformes, Family Estrildidae).The removal of UV wavelengths significantly changed the strength and frequency dependence of the seed preferences compared to the full-spectrum illumination.It did not affect the strength of frequency dependence compared to the removal of the short wavelengths (approximately 400-500 nm), medium wavelengths (approximately 500-600 nm) or long wavelengths (approximately 600-700 nm; Church et al., 2001).The authors discuss the possibility of ecological impact: the affect on the dynamics of the plant population depending upon the spectral quality of ambient light (it differs considerably depending on the climate, time of the day and local habitat geometry), but they warn of overestimating the importance of UV light compared to the human-visible spectrum.

(p2.4) Insectivorous birds also use chromatic cues in the search for prey.The principal for the finding of food is the differentiation of food in its background.Blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) were presented with two prey types that were achromatically identical but different in their chromatic properties in the UV/blue range on two achromatically identical backgrounds.The backgrounds had either the same chromatic properties as the prey (matching combination) or differed in their chromatic properties (mismatching combination).The tits used the chromatic cues successfully in their search in the mismatching background.The duration of prey search on the matching background was significantly longer, but the search for more chromatic prey on the same background was easier.The birds evidently used the combination of achromatic and chromatic cues for the successful search for prey (Stobbe et al., 2009).
## (s3) Signal and communication significance
(p3.0) The presence of UV reflecting plumage assumes the perception of UV wavelengths and suggests ecological significance (in inter-or intra-specific relations).Muellen and Pohland (2008) describe the results of the study on the existence of plumage regions with high proportions of the UV-reflecting feathers in nine hundred and sixty-eight bird species, covering all orders.Across nine orders: Struthioniformes, Tinamiformes, Craciformes, Turniciformes, Galbuliformes, Upupiformes, Coliiformes, Apodiformes and Musophagiformes all species were tested.High proportions of UVreflecting plumage were found in some coloured plumage regions.The species of some orders used mostly the UV maxima between 380-399 nm, these probably have a violet sensitive (VS) cone; other orders with ultraviolet sensitive (UVS) cones had their UV maxima mostly between 300 and 379 nm.

(p3.1) This suggests that it is not objective to classify the colouring of the bird plumage only according to human colour perception.Conspecific can perceive the plumage colouring differently, because most birds are visually sensitive to the wavelengths in the near-ultraviolet (300-400 nm).One example is the blue tit (Parus caeruleus = Cyanistes caeruleus), whose plumage shows considerable reflection of UV light.This species is sexually dichromatic for multiple regions of the plumage such as the crest, which shows the peak reflectance at wavelengths around 352 nm.This fact is important for the mate choice: the results of the experiments indicate that the blue tit females prefer the males with the brightest crests (Hunt et al., 1998).It is possible to markedly reduce the plumage brightness in the blue tit by experimentally accelerating the moult speed on the UV/blue crown feathers (for comparison the structural white on the cheek feather was not affected).UV/Blue colours are considered as a marker of an individual's performance during the previous breeding season.The relationship between the fast moulting and the colour expression present a selective advantage for early-breeding birds (Griggio et al., 2009).

(p3.2) In the example of the great tit (Parus major -Order Passeriformes, Family Paridae), the differences in the spectral reflectance of the yellow breast feathers in yearlings (though not older birds) between some populations have been identified.These differences in coloration among young birds of different origins correspond to genetic differences that were determined earlier.Systematic differences in colour signals probably exist across populations, among individuals of different origins (Postma and Gienapp, 2009).

(p3.3) Also starlings (Sturnus vulgaris -Passeriformes, Sturnidae) have sexually different body regions in plumage coloration unnoticed by the human eye.Cuthill et al. (1999) used multivariate analyses on principal components of reflectance spectra (300 to 720 nm) of plumage samples from different body regions of male and female starlings.Sex differences occurred in some body regions (though not in all), and were more pronounced at some wavelengths (both ultraviolet and human visible).

(p3.4) This phenomenon occurs across the taxonomical groups; Mahler and Kempenaers (2002) found differences in the UV reflectance of the plumage between males and females of the bird of Order Columbiformes, Family Columbidae -picui dove (Columbina picui).The male plumage was brighter than the one of females.Several body regions showed a significant sex difference in spectral shape, although this bird species was considered sexually monochromatic.
## (s4) Practical impacts on breeding, including veterinary care
(p4.0) A lot is evident from the above text.It is known that ultraviolet wavelengths are a component of normal avian colour perception.It is possible to expect other physiological influences of this environmental factor.Many artificial light conditions do not represent a full light spectrum.Maddocks et al. (2001) investigated the influence of the chronic longterm effects of the absence of UV light on domestic chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) in connection with the welfare of these animals.The topic of the investigation was the hormonal stress response to the absence of UV light.Chicks kept in a UV lightdeficient environment had significantly higher basal plasma corticosterone concentrations.The control group -chicks subjected to the full light spectrum had a significantly higher rate of corticosterone rise in stress situations compared to the chicks kept in UV light-deficient conditions, but there were some subsidiary influences (e.g., age).

(p4.1) Analogous results were reached by Maddocks et al. (2002) in experiments on European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris).Juvenile starlings had significantly higher basal plasma corticosterone concentrations in the UV-deficient light environments than those kept under the full spectrum lighting.The birds under the UV-deficient conditions showed significant changes in their behaviour (escaping behaviour).When the interval between the transfer from the wild to the experimental conditions was short (two days) birds showed significantly higher basal and maximum plasma corticosterone concentrations than starlings which were transferred after 7-14 days in captivity.In the second case, the capture stress had already subsided.Thus, the stress effects of UV light deficiency are apparently small relative to the overall impact of captivity; nevertheless, the former may become the more significant factor after the initial effects of capture subside.The authors note the significance of the full light spectrum for the welfare of captive birds.

(p4.2) For the study of museum specimens, it is very important to know the durability of the plumage features.Ultraviolet colour may be more susceptible to degradation than colours visible by the human eye as suggested by a study which performed measurements on five species of passerines collected over the past 100 years with a reflectance spectrophotometer.Contrary to these results, the results of the tests on the specimens collected within the past 50 years suggest that the colours were relatively unimpaired and that UV is not affected by fading more severely than human-visible colours (Armenta et al., 2008).
