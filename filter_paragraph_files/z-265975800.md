## (s5) Age
(p5.0) For individuals, the function of immune system will change with age.[37] Jabal et al described the trend of anti-S protein IgG levels with age in 514 Israeli medical personnel on day 21 after the first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.The results showed that IgG antibodies were detected in 475 (92%) of the vaccinated population, with a geometric mean concentration of 68.6 AU/mL.However, the 39 non-responders to the first dose of vaccine were older (median, 57 years), which was significantly different from the responders (median, 45 years) (P < .001).Moreover, antibody titers were found to decrease with age in antibody responders (P < .001).This trend still existed even when excluding previously infected respondents (P < .001). [38]In addition, a similar study by Tsatsakis et al also showed that an older age was associated with the lower the antibody titers (P < .001). [39]owever, Watanabe et al conducted a multifactorial antibody titer study in 86 healthcare workers (median, 29 years) in Rome who received 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 2021.The blood samples were taken for analysis of antibodies against the S protein.Multivariate analysis of the study showed that antibody titer was independent of age (P > .05). [40]he differences in the above analysis results might be related to different research methods, the number of people included in the study, and different quantitative indicators.In addition, the subjects in Watanabe et al study were young and had a small age span, which might lead to incomplete analysis of the age factor results.
## (s6) Race or ethnic group
(p6.0) Several reports had revealed ethnic differences in cancer incidence and mortality, as well as individual growth and associated metabolism. [41,42][45] The differences in COVID-19 vaccine among different ethnic groups are also of interest.Cai et al reported that the vaccine efficacy of black or African Americans was higher than that of white people, and the vaccine efficacy of black or African American and white participants was 95.37% and 89.81%, respectively. [46]In a phase III trial of Pfizer BNT162b2, 37,706 participants responded at least 2 months after receiving 2 doses of the vaccine.Of those participants, 83% were white, 9% were black or African American, 4.2% were Asian, and 28% were Hispanic or Latino.The report showed that vaccine efficacy in subgroups defined by race and ethnicity was broadly consistent with that observed in the overall population.The results were 95.2% for whites, 100% for blacks or African Americans, 94.4% for Hispanics or Latinos, and 89.3% for all other races after 2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. [25]
## (s7) Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection history
(p7.0) Many studies reported that the antibody titer of people with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection increased more significantly than that without SARS-CoV-2 infection after receiving a single dose of vaccine, and a single dose of vaccine may be sufficient for them.Racine et al conducted a longitudinal study to compare the antibody response of 68 patients vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine (19 patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, RecoVax group; 49 patients never infected with SARS-CoV-2, NaiveVax group).In the RecoVax group, the median time, from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to the first vaccination (D1), was 262 days (IQR 102-275).Before vaccination, there were detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and after D1, the antibody level in this population increased from an average of 47.45 U/mL (IQR19.59-148.7) to higher than the upper limit of detection (>2500 U/mL).It remained at this level for about 6 months after D1.The antibody level in the NaiveVax group gradually increased to an average of 37.77 U/ mL (IQR 12.93-80.45)before the second dose of vaccine (D2) after D1.Two weeks after D2, the average antibody was 2177 U/mL (IQR 1605->2500 U/mL).However, about 6 months after D2, the antibody level dropped to an average of 720 U/mL (IQR 565-1269).Although the total antibody level against S protein increased after D2, the antibody level in NaiveVax group was always lower than that in RecoVax group (P <.001 at all-time points).These data indicated that people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a stronger antibody response after vaccination, and a single dose of vaccine caused a strong enough antibody immune response in the RecoVax group. [47]Similarly, Fraley et al compared the antibody responses of the group without SARS-CoV-2 infection history and the group with SARS-CoV-2 infection 30 to 60 days before D1 after BNT162b2 vaccination.Three weeks after the initial inoculation, antibody titers to the 3 S subunit antigens (S1, S2, RBD) were significantly higher in both groups than the baseline.Moreover, the antibody titers of all S antigens in the infection group were significantly higher than those in the uninfected group (P < .001). 4 weeks after the second inoculation, the titers of the 3 S subunit proteins antibody in the uninfected group were significantly higher than those at the third week.The antibody levels of S1 and S2 were significantly higher in the infected group, but the RBD antibody level did not change significantly.The titers of S1 and RBD antibodies in the infected group at the 3rd week were similar to those in the uninfected group at the 7th week, but the levels of S2 antibody in the infected group at the 3rd and 7th weeks were significantly higher than those in the uninfected group (P < .001).The study also found that although the N protein is contained in the SARS-CoV-2, only the S protein is the vaccine targeted antigen.So higher level of N protein antibody was found only in the infection group.There was no significant change in N protein antibody levels after vaccination in both groups.The research showed that the population infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a higher antibody level after single dose vaccination, roughly equivalent to those observed in uninfected population after 2 doses of vaccination.
