## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) This paper provides a brief review of recent results obtained in the context of stability analysis for stochastic numerical methods.The treatise is essentially twofold: regarding stability properties as the preservation of qualitative features of the continuous problem as well as the numerical preservation of stable behaviors in the solution of the continuous problem.

(p0.1) The first highlighted aspect, i.e., stability as numerical preservation of qualitative properties, is here framed in the context of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with special emphasis on problems describing stochastic oscillators [1][2][3][4].The perspective we follow consists of providing a long-term analysis of numerical methods for SDEs in terms of preserving invariance laws that characterize the dynamics provided by the exact solution.A first contribution in this sense was given in [5], where the author analyzed the invariance of asymptotic laws characterizing linear stochastic systems under given discretizations.The analysis of partitioned methods for linear oscillators in the presence of additive noise has been an object of [6], while the analysis of linear second order SDEs describing damped stochastic oscillators has been provided by Burrage and Lythe in [1,2] and inspired the paper [3] giving a more general two-step framework.More recent contributions have regarded stochastic Hamiltonian problems [7,8] and stochastic oscillators with multiplicative noise [9].
## (s2) The Problem
(p2.0) The motion of a particle constrained by a deterministic forcing and a stochastic one, in the presence of damping, can be modeled by the following scalar second order SDE [1,2]

(p2.1) where f (x) is a deterministic forcing, η is the damping parameter, and εξ(t) is the stochastic forcing of amplitude ε.Clearly, assuming a linear forcing f (x) = −gX(t), Equation ( 1) admits the following first order It ô formulation
## (s3) The Methodology: Indirect Stochastic Linear Two-Step Methods
(p3.0) In [1][2][3], the authors have analyzed the ability of some of the most common numerical methods for SDEs in preserving the correlation matrix over long times.The analysis given in [1,2] only involves one-step methods, while that provided in [3] is focused on the larger class of indirect two-step methods (ITS methods), i.e., the family of stochastic two-step methods applied to the first order representation given by Equation (2) of the second order SDE in Equation (1).ITS methods assume the form

(p3.1) where the matrices R 1 (h), R 0 (h) ∈ R 2×2 and the vectors r 1 (h), r 0 (h) ∈ R 2 are the characteristic coefficients, collected in the Butcher tableau
## (s7) Stability Issues
(p7.0) The stability analysis provided in [15] relies on investigating the behavior of the above methods when applied to the linear test Equation ( 11) and the convolution one (12).As regards the linear test equation, mean-square and asymptotic stability properties of the exact solution respectively occur when
