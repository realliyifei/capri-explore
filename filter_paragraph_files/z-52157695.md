## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Cirrhosis, which is the final stage of liver fibrosis, is one of the major health-related concerns worldwide. According to the global reports, cirrhosis results in about 1 million deaths annually. 1 Among chronic diseases, after coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis is the fourth leading cause of lost life years. 1 Liver fibrosis, the healing process as a response to a wide spectrum of chronic complications, including viral hepatitis, and alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, 2 can encapsulate the injury in the first stages of the insult and is regarded as a protective and reversible response of the liver tissue to these subset of injuries. 3 However, if the damage remains for a longer period, liver fibrosis will lead to cirrhosis, which causes further life-threatening complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma. 4 Fibrosis formation is caused by imbalances in extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and its degeneration, which are regulated by extracellular enzymes; matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors; and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs), respectively.
