## (s0) | INTRODUC TI ON
(p0.0) Food losses are a major concern worldwide at the moment, as the world's population continues to grow, and nearly one-third of all food produced for human consumption is either lost or wasted (FAO, 2011).
## (s2) | ANTIBAC TERIAL S
(p2.0) The second group of natural food preservatives is antibacterial plants, which contain terpenes, peptides, polysaccharides, and phenolic compounds.These bioactive compounds have medicinal characteristics including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiinflammatory effects that reduce or inhibit the risk of chronic and acute diseases.The primary function of antimicrobial activity is to control the growth of microorganisms that cause bacterial and fungal contamination in food products.The main goal of their use in food industry is to prevent food spoilage in processed and readyto-eat food.

(p2.1) Microorganisms can have an impact on food in both positive and negative ways.Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactic acid bacteria, and Acetobacterium species are the main microorganisms for food fermentation (Xu, 2017).Several phenolic compounds as well as ferulic acid, coumaric acid, and catechins were found to inhibit the growth of microbes, for example, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, and Listeria monocytogenes (El-Sayed & Youssef, 2019).
