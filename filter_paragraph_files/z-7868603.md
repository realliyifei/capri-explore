## (s2) Assessment of Nail Psoriasis
(p2.0) The availability of sensitive, responsive, specific, and validated outcome measures is essential in drug research and comparison of trials. Unfortunately, these are still missing in nail psoriasis. Most recent studies on nail psoriasis use the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), target NAPSI, or one of its many variants as a marker of nail improvement [23]. To calculate the NAPSI, each nail is divided into four quadrants, each of which are evaluated for the presence of any manifestations of psoriasis in the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, nail plate crumbling) and nail bed (oil-drop discoloration, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, splinter hemorrhages). If any sign is present in all four quadrants, the nail is given a score of 4, through to a score of 0 if there are no signs in any quadrant. Each nail is assigned a nail matrix and a nail bed score of 0-4, which are combined to yield a total score of 0-8 for each nail. All nails may be evaluated, with the total NAPSI score being the sum of the scores, up to 80 if only fingers (10 nails) are considered, or up to 160 if toes are also included (20 nails). In clinical studies, often only the most seriously involved nail is targeted (target NAPSI) to assess the effects of drug therapy. Some studies use (target) NAPSI-50, NAPSI-75, and NAPSI-90 to indicate the percentage of patients achieving a (target) NAPSI improvement of at least 50, 75, or 90 %, respectively. Despite its current popularity in nail psoriasis studies, the NAPSI has some disadvantages. Its poor validation, the fact that the important nail psoriasis feature 'subungual hyperkeratosis' is not included and, in particular, the lack of correspondence of NAPSI scores with the clinical severity of nail psoriasis are important disadvantages of this scoring system [24]. Most of these limitations are absent in a newly developed scoring system, the N-NAIL, which has been partly validated [24]; however, this system has not been used in any published clinical studies. Older studies have used many different scoring systems, which, together with the major differences in study design, inclusion criteria, and follow-up, make it difficult to compare the results of individual trials. Furthermore, not only should clinical severity be part of a core outcome set in nail psoriasis but, ideally, it should also involve patient-assessed signs, QoL, patient satisfaction with treatment and outcome, adverse events, and probably costs. A first attempt at developing a tool for the assessment of various domains of nail psoriasis outcomes, known as Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (NAPPA), has recently been published [25].

## (s3) Management of Nail Psoriasis
(p3.0) Treating nail psoriasis is often a time-consuming challenge with an unsecure outcome. Response to treatment may appear everywhere in the spectrum, from very disappointing to excellent, but relapses are common. Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence-based treatments and consequent guidelines [15]. This does not necessarily mean that available treatments are not efficacious, but that final statistical evidence is missing. Therapeutic options include patient education, external topical treatments, intralesional steroids, systemic treatments, and non-pharmacological treatment options. Patient education should cover the avoidance of minor repetitive nail trauma, managing expectations with regard to the amount of time necessary for nail clearing, and discussing prevention and treatment of fungal infections in psoriasis nails [26]. Psoriatic nail changes can be provoked by minor traumas, such as nail biting, subungual cleaning, picking, or manicure. Patients should avoid these habits and keep the nails as short as possible to prevent trauma or lifting of the poorly attached nail plate [27]. Before the start of treatment, the clinician should discuss with the patient that any noticeable nail improvement will take a long time; many treatments will show maximal results only after 1 year. The low growth rate of the nail plate is responsible for a delay of 3-9 months before clinical improvement can be noticed in cases of effective treatment. Four to 6 months is a reasonable period of treatment before evaluating clinically relevant results. In the beginning, the improvement may be so limited that it is advisable to take photographs of the nails during each visit to convince both the patient and the physician that the treatment has positive results. Concomitant onychomycosis has a high prevalence in psoriatic nails. A meta-analysis has shown a prevalence of 18.0 % in psoriasis patients compared with a prevalence of 9.1 % in control groups [28]. This high prevalence rate should be a reason for excluding onychomycosis before starting intensive treatment for nail psoriasis. Obviously, treatment of concomitant onychomycosis will improve the outcome of all other treatments.

(p3.1) The choice of treatments depends on clinical presentation, as well as patient-related factors. Most patients have only mild nail psoriasis without signs of PsA or severe PP. These patients may profit from topical treatment, while systemic treatment is indicated in patients with severe nail psoriasis, major impact on QoL, or concomitant moderate to severe psoriatic skin lesions. Systemic therapy should also be favored if concomitant PsA is evident. The choice of treatments further depends on patient factors, including age, experienced burden of disease, accompanying diseases and therapies, individual patient preferences, and the risks of treatment.

(p3.2) This review covers treatment options for nail psoriasis and is the result of a systemic approach to the literature. The following databases were searched (to December 2015): the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, and Pubmed (from 1948). Essentially, the search strategy included psoria*, and (nail*, or toenail* or thumbnail*, or ungual, or unguel, or unguium, or pitting, or punctate, or Beau's lines, or subungual hyperkeratosis, or onycholysis) and (trial). Overall, 120 publications were identified using this search strategy. The titles and abstracts of each of these publications were evaluated and a total of 72 studies or case reports on the treatment of nail psoriasis were selected for complete reviewing. Publications without original data were discarded. In addition, the reference lists of all publications were checked, which resulted in an 69 additional publications. The number of additional publications retrieved by checking reference lists was high, and was mainly caused by the fact that nail psoriasis was often a secondary endpoint in studies on PP or PsA, and was not mentioned in the abstract.

## (s5) Topical Corticosteroids
(p5.0) Topical corticosteroids have been used for many decades to suppress psoriatic inflammation in PP. Also in nail psoriasis, potent and superpotent corticosteroids are used frequently, and appear to be more effective in nail matrix psoriasis than in nail bed psoriasis. Topical corticosteroids are available in the form of ointments, creams, lotions, emulsions, and even nail lacquers, and the frequency of application frequency is usually once or twice daily. If used frequently and for a prolonged period, telangiectasia of the surrounding skin and atrophy of the skin and underlying phalanx may appear. Others prefer pulse therapy, with application on four consecutive days each week, in order to prevent these side effects. Clinical improvement may not be expected within 4-6 months of treatment, and further improvement can be seen during the first year.

(p5.1) In spite of the long history of corticosteroids in the treatment of nail psoriasis, only a few formal trials of their efficacy have been conducted. Clinical studies on topical corticosteroid monotherapy are even sparser. RCTs using betamethasone dipropionate ointment (64 mg/g) twice daily [29,30] and clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily [31] identified positive effects on subungual hyperkeratosis, salmon patches, pitting, and onycholysis after 12-20 weeks of use. One study compared betamethasone dipropionate (64 mg/g) and salicylic acid (0.03 g/g) ointment with calcipotriol ointment (50 lg/g) in the treatment of nail bed psoriasis with severe subungual hyperkeratosis [30]. After 3 months of treatment, subungual fingernail and toenail hyperkeratosis was reduced by 20-30 % in both groups (no statistical differences). Rigopoulos et al. conducted an RCT comparing tazarotene 0.1 % cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily for 12 weeks [31]. Patients showed a significant improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. Mild side effects were reported in 18.8 % of the tazarotene-treated patients, including desquamation and erythema of the nail-fold skin, periungual irritation, paronychia, and irritation of the skin of the toe or finger distanced from the nail area. Formulations with corticosteroids in a nail lacquer have been studied more often than other forms but are not yet commercially available. In particular, 8 % clobetasol-17-propionate in a nail lacquer has shown positive results in placebo-controlled, open studies [32][33][34]. Fifty-two to 90 % of patients showed improvement after therapy, which was directly related to the length of treatment. The symptoms that responded best to therapy were onycholysis and pitting (indicating an action on the nail matrix); however, improvement of salmon patches and subungual hyperkeratosis has also been reported, whereas splinter hemorrhages were most persistent. No adverse effects, such as atrophy, hypochromy, periungual telangiectasia, local pain, and hypersensitivity, were noted.

Also in nail psoriasis, potent and superpotent corticosteroids are used frequently, and appear to be more effective in nail matrix psoriasis than in nail bed psoriasis.

The symptoms that responded best to therapy were onycholysis and pitting (indicating an action on the nail matrix); however, improvement of salmon patches and subungual hyperkeratosis has also been reported, whereas splinter hemorrhages were most persistent. No adverse effects, such as atrophy, hypochromy, periungual telangiectasia, local pain, and hypersensitivity, were noted.

(p5.6) Topical corticosteroids have been used for many decades to suppress psoriatic inflammation in PP. Also in nail psoriasis, potent and superpotent corticosteroids are used frequently, and appear to be more effective in nail matrix psoriasis than in nail bed psoriasis. Topical corticosteroids are available in the form of ointments, creams, lotions, emulsions, and even nail lacquers, and the frequency of application frequency is usually once or twice daily. If used frequently and for a prolonged period, telangiectasia of the surrounding skin and atrophy of the skin and underlying phalanx may appear. Others prefer pulse therapy, with application on four consecutive days each week, in order to prevent these side effects. Clinical improvement may not be expected within 4-6 months of treatment, and further improvement can be seen during the first year.

(p5.7) In spite of the long history of corticosteroids in the treatment of nail psoriasis, only a few formal trials of their efficacy have been conducted. Clinical studies on topical corticosteroid monotherapy are even sparser. RCTs using betamethasone dipropionate ointment (64 mg/g) twice daily [29,30] and clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily [31] identified positive effects on subungual hyperkeratosis, salmon patches, pitting, and onycholysis after 12-20 weeks of use. One study compared betamethasone dipropionate (64 mg/g) and salicylic acid (0.03 g/g) ointment with calcipotriol ointment (50 lg/g) in the treatment of nail bed psoriasis with severe subungual hyperkeratosis [30]. After 3 months of treatment, subungual fingernail and toenail hyperkeratosis was reduced by 20-30 % in both groups (no statistical differences). Rigopoulos et al. conducted an RCT comparing tazarotene 0.1 % cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily for 12 weeks [31]. Patients showed a significant improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. Mild side effects were reported in 18.8 % of the tazarotene-treated patients, including desquamation and erythema of the nail-fold skin, periungual irritation, paronychia, and irritation of the skin of the toe or finger distanced from the nail area. Formulations with corticosteroids in a nail lacquer have been studied more often than other forms but are not yet commercially available. In particular, 8 % clobetasol-17-propionate in a nail lacquer has shown positive results in placebo-controlled, open studies [32][33][34]. Fifty-two to 90 % of patients showed improvement after therapy, which was directly related to the length of treatment. The symptoms that responded best to therapy were onycholysis and pitting (indicating an action on the nail matrix); however, improvement of salmon patches and subungual hyperkeratosis has also been reported, whereas splinter hemorrhages were most persistent. No adverse effects, such as atrophy, hypochromy, periungual telangiectasia, local pain, and hypersensitivity, were noted.
## (s7) Intralesional Corticosteroids
(p7.0) Locally injected steroids have a long history in the treatment of nail psoriasis [40]. Locally penetrating doses of steroid into a digit are administered by needle injection or highpressure jet from a tool such as the 'Port-o-jet', 'Med-Jet MBX', or others. Needle injection is the most common of these, with the temporary popularity of the Port-o-jet waning as concern developed over the potential for splash-back of blood and steroid from the breached epidermis on to the instrument and practitioner, or the development of epidermal inclusion cysts. The existing evidence suggests that intralesional injection into the nail bed and matrix are particularly effective for alleviating lesions caused by psoriasis of the nail matrix, and also has moderate effects on nail bed signs ( Table 1). Injections in the region of the nail matrix has almost no effects on nail bed signs of nail psoriasis.

(p7.1) The recommended protocols of treatment differ considerably. Initially, injections of triamcinolone acetonide (5 mg/ml) were administered monthly for 6 months in the proximal nail fold, followed by a further four injections over the next 6 months and then every 2 months for the final 6-to 12-month period [40][41][42][43]. More recent publications prefer a higher concentration of triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/ml), 0.1 ml administered in each of the four periungual sites, ensuring symmetrical delivery of the steroid to the nail matrix and nail bed, and administered less frequently, such as every 2 months [44,45]. Clinical results of this modified regimen were investigated in two studies suggesting improved efficacy on the signs of nail bed psoriasis (Table 1) [44,45].

(p7.2) Side effects after these procedures are well known: short-term paresthesia [44,45] and focal pain that may last for several months [40,45]; hematoma formation is rather common (up to 20 %) but asymptomatic [45]. Loss of the nail plate was seen in 9 % of patients in one study [45]. Occasionally, nail-fold atrophy can be encountered, and is often reversible. Chronic topical therapy can lead to complications of the 'disappearing digit' [46] with atrophy of the underlying phalanx [47]. Rupture of the extensor tendon has also been reported after local injection of steroids [48,49].

(p7.3) Locally injected steroids have a long history in the treatment of nail psoriasis [40].

(p7.4) The recommended protocols of treatment differ considerably. Initially, injections of triamcinolone acetonide (5 mg/ml) were administered monthly for 6 months in the proximal nail fold, followed by a further four injections over the next 6 months and then every 2 months for the final 6-to 12-month period [40][41][42][43]. More recent publications prefer a higher concentration of triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/ml), 0.1 ml administered in each of the four periungual sites, ensuring symmetrical delivery of the steroid to the nail matrix and nail bed, and administered less frequently, such as every 2 months [44,45].

## (s8) Vitamin D3 Derivates: Calcipotriol, Tacalcitol, Calcitriol
(p8.0) Vitamin D analogs regulate epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as production and release of proinflammatory cytokines. Topical formulations containing vitamin D3 (calcitriol) and vitamin D analogs (calcipotriol, tacalcitol) are effective treatments for PP, both as monotherapies and in fixed combinations with corticosteroids. Vitamin D3 derivates appear to be more effective in treating nail bed signs of psoriasis than in nail matrix signs. Studies using calcitriol in the treatment of nail psoriasis are rare. One case was reported whereby the patient responded well to treatment with calcitriol ointment [50]; however, it was not completely clear whether this patient suffered from nail psoriasis. One RCT compared calcitriol ointment (3 lg/g) twice daily with betamethasone diproprionate (64 mg/g) on subungual hyperkeratosis [29]. After 20 weeks, nails treated with calcitriol had a 38 % reduction in thickness compared with a 35 % reduction seen in nails treated with betamethasone diproprionate (not significant). Tacalcitol is a chemical vitamin D analog that has been investigated as a monotherapy in one open study of 15 patients with both nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis [51]. Patients used the tacalcitol ointment (4 lg/g) every night in occlusion (with cotton gloves) for 6 months. After 3 months, the NAPSI dropped more than 50 %, and after 6 months of treatment the NAPSI was approximately 75 % lower than at baseline. Most patients presented with pain at the beginning of the study, but none reported discomfort after 6 months. Surprisingly, the greatest improvement was seen in nail matrix signs of nail psoriasis. Combining tacalcitol ointment (10 lg/g) with a nail lacquer containing 8 % clobetasol-17-propionate (twice weekly) resulted in major improvement of both nail bed and nail matrix signs [39].

(p8.1) Calcipotriol is the vitamin D analog most widely investigated in nail psoriasis, often in combination with other treatments but also as monotherapy. One case-series study evaluated the efficacy of calcipotriol ointment (50 lg/g) monotherapy twice daily without occlusion in the treatment of nail psoriasis for 5 months [52]. Calcipotriol was particularly effective in nail bed signs of subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and discoloration. In addition, fingertip tenderness and pain of an involved distal phalanx were significantly reduced. In a 12-week study comparing calcipotriol (50 lg/g) monotherapy with calcipotriol/betamethasone-dipropionate combination therapy, only oil-drop discoloration improved, without differences between the two groups [36]. The same two compounds in a single ointment resulted in a 72 % NAPSI improvement at 12 weeks in patients with extremely mild nail psoriasis [37]. Other studies of combination therapy of calcipotriol and corticosteroids are discussed in Sect. 5.2.
## (s9) Tazarotene
(p9.0) Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids that is selective for b and c isotypes of the retinoic acid receptor. It has been shown to have antiproliferative, normalizing-of-differentiation, and anti-inflammatory effects, and is approved for the treatment of psoriasis, acne, and photodamage. Several studies have been performed to estimate efficacy in nail psoriasis [31,[54][55][56][57].

(p9.1) In these studies, tazarotene 0.1 % gel, ointment, or cream was used once daily for 12-24 weeks. In one study, tazarotene was effective for onycholysis and pitting (only if applied under occlusion) at 24 weeks, but not for subungual hyperkeratosis, leukonychia, nail plate crumbling/loss, or splinter hemorrhages [54]; however, other studies saw an improvement in hyperkeratosis and oil spots [55,58]. A better response of nail bed signs than nail matrix signs was also concluded from another study [56]. An 88 % improvement in NAPSI at 6 months was reported from this study, but patients had only mild nail psoriasis at baseline (median NAPSI 15). Rigopoulos et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind study comparing tazarotene cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream, both under occlusion [31]. The results of this study showed a significant time-effect improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. The most recent study investigating tazarotene in nail psoriasis compared the efficacy of pulsed dye laser (PDL) plus topical tazarotene cream versus topical tazarotene alone [57]. After 6 months of tazarotene treatment without occlusion, no improvement in nail bed or nail matrix psoriasis could be observed. An explanation for this failure might be the fact that most patients were also receiving systemic therapy or using phototherapy. The laser results will be discussed in Sect. 10.1. From these studies, tazarotene appears to be effective for nail bed signs of psoriasis only. Use may be limited by the preferred use under occlusion and by the relatively frequently occurring side effects, such as erythema, irritation, desquamation, and paronychia.

(p9.2) Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids that is selective for b and c isotypes of the retinoic acid receptor.

## (s10) Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors
(p10.0) Calcineurin is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that activates T cells by upregulation of the expression of IL-2. Increased IL-2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cell responses. Systemic inhibition of calcineurin, particularly with cyclosporine, has been shown to be an effective treatment for PP [59]. The use of systemic calcineurin inhibitors in psoriasis is limited by potential severe side effects; however, topical treatment of nail psoriasis with calcineurin inhibitors could prevent the majority of these side effects. Several case reports and studies using topical cyclosporine and tacrolimus have been published [60][61][62]. In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, nails of eight patients were treated twice daily for 12 weeks with a 70 mg/ml maize-oil-dissolved oral cyclosporine solution [61]. This study showed excellent results in the majority of patients; mean improvement was 77 % in the cyclosporine-treated group and 12 % in the placebo-treated group. Improvement was noted both in nail matrix signs of nail psoriasis (pitting) and in nail bed signs (hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, crumbling, and oil-drop discoloration). No local or systemic side effects were detectable, but nails may turn yellowish after long-term application of cyclosporine in maize oil. These positive results were rather surprising considering the known issue of difficult penetration of cyclosporine through the skin and the nail due to its highly lipophilic nature and size of the molecule [63]. Later, Prins et al. reported pharmaceutical instability of the used topical cyclosporine emulsion for nail psoriasis within 4 h after preparation [64]. According to this study, patients should homogenize the emulsion before each application in order to prevent treatment failure. An unpublished study from Rotterdam, The Netherlands, sponsored by Novartis (ISRCTN47031769) tried to confirm the positive results of cyclosporine on nail psoriasis, but the investigators were unable to find differences between the cyclosporine-treated nails and the maize-oiltreated nails (personal communication).

(p10.1) Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor with much better skin-penetrating capacities than cyclosporine. In a 12-week randomized, controlled, open-label study, the efficacy and safety of topical treatment with tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment was assessed in 21 patients with nail psoriasis [62]. Application was once daily at bedtime onto the nail folds of affected nails, without occlusion, and patients were instructed not to wash their hands until the next morning. The severity of nail psoriasis improved significantly, as measured by overall NAPSI (-57 %) and target NAPSI (-65 %). Tacrolimus ointment proved to be equally effective on nail bed and nail matrix features. One patient was withdrawn from tacrolimus application after 9 weeks because of the appearance of acute paronychia. No other side effects were recorded in the observation time.These results suggest that topical tacrolimus is one of the more effective and tolerable treatments for both nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis, but these results need confirmation from additional studies.

The use of systemic calcineurin inhibitors in psoriasis is limited by potential severe side effects; however, topical treatment of nail psoriasis with calcineurin inhibitors could prevent the majority of these side effects. Several case reports and studies using topical cyclosporine and tacrolimus have been published [60][61][62]. In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, nails of eight patients were treated twice daily for 12 weeks with a 70 mg/ml maize-oil-dissolved oral cyclosporine solution [61]. This study showed excellent results in the majority of patients; mean improvement was 77 % in the cyclosporine-treated group and 12 % in the placebo-treated group. Improvement was noted both in nail matrix signs of nail psoriasis (pitting) and in nail bed signs (hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, crumbling, and oil-drop discoloration). No local or systemic side effects were detectable, but nails may turn yellowish after long-term application of cyclosporine in maize oil. These positive results were rather surprising considering the known issue of difficult penetration of cyclosporine through the skin and the nail due to its highly lipophilic nature and size of the molecule [63]. Later, Prins et al. reported pharmaceutical instability of the used topical cyclosporine emulsion for nail psoriasis within 4 h after preparation [64]. According to this study, patients should homogenize the emulsion before each application in order to prevent treatment failure. An unpublished study from Rotterdam, The Netherlands, sponsored by Novartis (ISRCTN47031769) tried to confirm the positive results of cyclosporine on nail psoriasis, but the investigators were unable to find differences between the cyclosporine-treated nails and the maize-oiltreated nails (personal communication).

(p10.7) Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor with much better skin-penetrating capacities than cyclosporine. In a 12-week randomized, controlled, open-label study, the efficacy and safety of topical treatment with tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment was assessed in 21 patients with nail psoriasis [62]. Application was once daily at bedtime onto the nail folds of affected nails, without occlusion, and patients were instructed not to wash their hands until the next morning. The severity of nail psoriasis improved significantly, as measured by overall NAPSI (-57 %) and target NAPSI (-65 %). Tacrolimus ointment proved to be equally effective on nail bed and nail matrix features. One patient was withdrawn from tacrolimus application after 9 weeks because of the appearance of acute paronychia. No other side effects were recorded in the observation time.These results suggest that topical tacrolimus is one of the more effective and tolerable treatments for both nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis, but these results need confirmation from additional studies.
## (s11) Anthralin
(p11.0) Anthralin (dithranol) was first synthesized as a derivative of chrysarobin, prepared from the araroba tree in Brazil over a century ago. It is an effective treatment of skin lesions in psoriasis by inhibiting keratinocyte hyperproliferation and interfering with several relevant steps of the immune system [65]. In one uncontrolled study, 20 psoriasis patients with nail involvement were treated with topical anthralin therapy [66]. An ointment of anthralin in petrolatum was applied to the affected nail bed once daily and then washed away with water after 30 min. Therapy was started with 0.4 % anthralin, and in case of lack of improvement, the concentration was gradually increased up to 2.0 %. Within 5 months of therapy, approximately half of the patients showed good improvement of nail bed signs of onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and thickening of the nail. In addition, pitting, a nail matrix sign of nail psoriasis, had improved, which is surprising since only the nail bed had been treated. Longitudinal lines or transverse lines were unresponsive. A disturbing side effect of anthralin therapy was reversible pigmentation of the nail plate, in particular accumulating in the pits. This hyperpigmentation could be reduced, but not abolished, with 10 % triethanolamine cream applied after washing away the anthralin cream.

## (s14) Methotrexate
(p14.0) As an orally or subcutaneously administered systemic compound, methotrexate is one of the most used systemic treatments in PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis. It is cost effective and its efficacy in PP and PsA has been known for many years [59]. A wide range of potential side effects limit its use, including hepatotoxicity, ulcerative stomatitis, lymphopenia, nausea, low white blood cell count, and nausea. Studies focussing on methotrexate in nail psoriasis show efficacy, but significantly less than most biologics ( Table 2) [77][78][79][80]. One RCT comparing methotrexate and cyclosporine in nail psoriasis showed a mean NAPSI improvement of 43 % in methotrexate-treated patients and 37 % in cyclosporine-treated patients at 24 weeks (not significant) [77]. The methotrexate group showed a significant improvement in nail matrix scores only, while the cyclosporine group showed significant improvement in nail bed scores only [77]. Methotrexate efficacy to treat nail psoriasis has also been compared with briakinumab in an RCT [78]. Target NAPSI improved 38 % in methotrexatetreated patients and 56 % in briakinumab-treated patients. Patients were treated with an extremely slowly increasing dose of methotrexate for 24 weeks, which might have had a negative impact on outcome. Smaller, non-controlled studies showed NAPSI improvements in the same range [79,80].

## (s15) Cyclosporine
(p15.0) The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine is a powerful immunosuppressive drug that, in dermatology, has a position in the treatment of several disorders, such as severe eczema, PP, and alopecia areata. Topical use of cyclosporine in nail psoriasis has been discussed in Sect. 5.6, but systemic use has also been the topic of several reports that, despite the lack of efficacy in PsA, show reasonable efficacy in the treatment of both nail bed and nail matrix signs of psoriasis [53,79,[81][82][83][84]. One study indicated more efficacy of cyclosporine in nail bed psoriasis than in nail matrix psoriasis [77]. The efficacy of cyclosporine in comparison with other drugs has been reported in several studies. While Gumusel et al., who used the NAPSI as a scoring system, were unable to see significant differences between cyclosporine and methotrexate, most other studies used uncommon endpoints [77]. Mahrle et al. reported on a study of cyclosporine versus an obsolete retinoid-etretinate-using an unspecified 4-point scale [82]. Nail involvement had decreased by 46 and 34 % compared with baseline after 22 weeks of treatment with cyclosporine and etretinate, respectively. A 12-month comparison of cyclosporine with an anti-TNFa biologic-adalimumab-in PsA patients also suffering from nail psoriasis showed a NAPSI-50 in 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs [84]. The finding that cyclosporine was comparable to biologics in treating nail psoriasis was also confirmed in a retrospective database study: cyclosporine was the most effective classical systemic treatment; NAPSI improved 89 % at 48 weeks of treatment [79]. Concomitant use of cyclosporine and topical calcipotriol cream three times daily may further improve treatment results [53]. While most studies use doses between 3 and 5 mg/day, one study from Japan investigated a lower dose of cyclosporine per day; the initial dose of 3 mg/kg/day was successfully reduced to 1.5 mg/kg/day in responders [83]. Cyclosporine use may be limited by the relatively high rates of side effects; the most serious adverse reactions are mostly reversible renal dysfunction and hypertension. Other side effects include fatigue, headache, paresthesia, hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia, and gastrointestinal disorders. After prolonged use, cyclosporine may play a role in the development of renal failure and several malignancies. For this reason, it is often considered as an effective treatment for severe cases of (nail) psoriasis, but only for a period of 6-12 months.

## (s16) Retinoids
(p16.0) Acitretin is a non-immunosuppressing antipsoriatic drug that can be used for years in patients who can tolerate its side effects, such as cheilitis, dry mouth, and skin exfoliation [85]. Acitretin normalizes cellular differentiation and controls inflammation. The position of acitretin in the treatment of nail psoriasis is that of a rather slow-acting compound with moderate efficacy and action, particularly on nail bed signs of psoriasis (Table 2) [79,80,82,86,87]. Two open studies and one retrospective analysis indicated that a NAPSI improvement of 40-50 % at 6-12 months may be expected [79,87]. At earlier time points, acitretin is considerably less effective [79,80]. Acitretin can also be used as an adjuvant therapy to psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB), as discussed in Sect. 10.3.

## (s17) Apremilast
(p17.0) Apremilast is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 that alters the expression of a variety of immune mediators [88]. It is USA FDA-and European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved for the treatment of adults with psoriasis and PsA. Two RCTs (ESTEEM 1 and 2) in which nail psoriasis was a secondary endpoint investigated its efficacy in nail psoriasis ( The general opinion is that it has little efficacy in nail psoriasis, but one case has been reported in which it was effective both on nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis [92]. Side effects are frequent in patients using FAEs, such as episodes of flushing, abdominal pain, and a decrease in lymphocyte count. Sulfasalazine is an aminosalicylate used as a traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of peripheral involvement in PsA. Sulfasalazine is metabolized by gut flora into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid, which act as anti-inflammatory agents. The role of sulfasalazine in cutaneous psoriatic lesions and nail psoriasis is not generally accepted. One case has been reported on the use of sulfasalazine in the treatment of psoriatic nail lesions [93]. After 3 months, nail lesions started to recede and disappeared progressively. No other cases have been reported in literature.

(p17.1) Leflunomide is another DMARD used to treat PsA. It is a de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor with immunomodulatory properties. One prospective study assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of leflunomide in patients with PsA, and also in psoriatic nail disease [94]. Unlike most studies on PP, patients in this study also received concomitant antiinflammatory/antirheumatic drugs, systemic corticosteroids, and other DMARDs, predominately methotrexate. Significant improvements were experienced in 32 % of patients with nail lesions. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea, alopecia, hypertension, and pruritus.

(p17.6) Apremilast is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 that alters the expression of a variety of immune mediators [88]. It is USA FDA-and European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved for the treatment of adults with psoriasis and PsA. Two RCTs (ESTEEM 1 and 2) in which nail psoriasis was a secondary endpoint investigated its efficacy in nail psoriasis ( The general opinion is that it has little efficacy in nail psoriasis, but one case has been reported in which it was effective both on nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis [92]. Side effects are frequent in patients using FAEs, such as episodes of flushing, abdominal pain, and a decrease in lymphocyte count. Sulfasalazine is an aminosalicylate used as a traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of peripheral involvement in PsA. Sulfasalazine is metabolized by gut flora into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid, which act as anti-inflammatory agents. The role of sulfasalazine in cutaneous psoriatic lesions and nail psoriasis is not generally accepted. One case has been reported on the use of sulfasalazine in the treatment of psoriatic nail lesions [93]. After 3 months, nail lesions started to recede and disappeared progressively. No other cases have been reported in literature.

(p17.7) Leflunomide is another DMARD used to treat PsA. It is a de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor with immunomodulatory properties. One prospective study assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of leflunomide in patients with PsA, and also in psoriatic nail disease [94]. Unlike most studies on PP, patients in this study also received concomitant antiinflammatory/antirheumatic drugs, systemic corticosteroids, and other DMARDs, predominately methotrexate. Significant improvements were experienced in 32 % of patients with nail lesions. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea, alopecia, hypertension, and pruritus.
## (s18) Biologics
(p18.0) The introduction of biologics has led to a major step forward in the treatment of severe PP and PsA, and may have the potential to revolutionize the management of patients with disabling psoriatic nail disease. Anti-TNFa treatments were the first, very effective biologics that became available to psoriasis patients. More recently, other mechanisms of the psoriatic inflammatory reaction can be suppressed with anti-IL-17, and anti-IL-12/23 monoclonal antibodies. Consequently, the therapeutic armamentarium is expanding for patients with moderate to severe PP or PsA who are unresponsive to conventional systemic therapies or have contraindications for these therapies. Infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab are anti-TNFa treatments available both for PP and PsA patients, while golimumab and certolizumab pegol only have registration for PsA. The biologic ustekinumab, which targets IL-12/23, and the anti-IL-17 antibody secukinumab are also available for both PP and PsA. All these biologics appear to have a positive effect on nail psoriasis, without major differences in efficacy between the populations they are investigated in, i.e. PP or PsA (Table 3). In general, nail responses are slow but continue to improve, lagging behind cutaneous responses over time. While the onset of response in nail psoriasis is mostly noticeable after approximately 12 weeks, further improvement or even complete clearance can be seen through to 1 year of treatment. Nonetheless, nail, skin, and joint manifestations of psoriasis generally improved in parallel based on correlation between NAPSI, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses over time. Overall, patients with greater skin or joint responses also demonstrated better nail responses. On the other hand, the presence of nail disease was not shown to predict good response of the arthritis [95], and improvement of nail psoriasis by a biologic did not depend on the presence or absence of PsA [96].

## (s19) Inhibition of Tumor Necrosis Factor-a
(p19.0) TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in psoriasis by promoting an inflammatory infiltrate into the skin and inducing keratinocyte proliferation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis, which directly contributes to the characteristic skin and nail lesions. Anti-TNFa has shown to be a relatively safe and very effective treatment for PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis ( Table 3). The originally high cost of these treatments has limited their use in nail psoriasis, but since lower-cost biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept have been approved in the US and/or the EU they may become available to more patients with nail psoriasis. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol all appear to be effective treatments for nail psoriasis and will be discussed individually in the following sections. The most often reported adverse effects related to the use of TNFa antagonists are activation of opportune infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), demyelinating diseases, congestive heart failure, induction of the formation of autologous antibodies, and antibodies neutralizing anti-TNFa drugs [97]. The development of anti-TNFa-induced lupus or classical druginduced lupus is more rarely reported. Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.

## (s20) Infliximab
(p20.0) Infliximab was approved in the US in 1998 for the treatment of Crohn's disease. Thereafter, infliximab has had its indication expanded, and in 2005/2006 became available for the treatment of PsA and PP. It is a chimeric anti-TNFa immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that is comprised of human antibody constant regions and murine variable regions. Infliximab binds both soluble and membrane-bound TNFa, preventing it from binding its receptor, resulting in a decrease in epidermal T-cell infiltration. The chimeric character of infliximab may result in a higher formation of neutralizing antibodies than occurs with fully human(-ized) antibodies. A concern related to the formation of these antibodies is the decreased efficacy of infliximab over time, which may require increased infusion frequencies, higher doses to maintain a clinical response and disease control, and infusion reactions, occurring in 16 % of infliximab-treated patients [98]. These reactions can involve chills, fever, headache, flushing and urticaria, myalgia and arthralgia, nausea, dyspnoea, and hypotension [99][100][101]. Most infusion-related reactions are mild and can usually be ameliorated by reducing the rate of infusion rather than discontinuing therapy. However, anaphylactic reactions are also possible, requiring surveillance during and for 1 h after infusion. A type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction may also present 3-12 days after infusion and produce a serum sickness-like reaction [102]. A study comparing the incidence of onychomycosis inpatients      treated with infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab has shown a statistical positive association between fungal infections of the nail in psoriasis patients and the use of infliximab [103]. Thirty-three percent of patients receiving infliximab had a positive fungal culture, while in patients receiving etanercept and adalimumab, as well as controls, this percentage was 15.5, 13.3, and 13.9 %, respectively. Several studies have proven the beneficial effect of infliximab on nail psoriasis, both in PsA and PP patients, and also in patients with severe nail psoriasis at baseline (Table 3). No differences between efficacy in nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis have been reported. Patients with a high PASI response have a more rapid and profound nail response than patients with a poorer PASI response [104]. In addition, QoL improves during infliximab treatment in nail psoriasis [105].
## (s21) Adalimumab
(p21.0) PP and PsA are both indications for adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNFa IgG1 monoclonal antibody. On binding TNFa, adalimumab neutralizes the biological activities of this cytokine by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, and modulating biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNFa. Initially, its efficacy in nail psoriasis was claimed in a case report [115] but clinical studies have followed ( Table 3). The first study was an open-label study in patients with mild to moderate nail psoriasis [96]. After 24 weeks of treatment, the fingernail NAPSI had improved 85 %. No differences in efficacy were seen between patients with PP only and patients with both PP and PsA. Another open-label study investigated the efficacy of adalimumab in 259 PsA patients only [116]. At week 12, NAPSI improvement in patients naive for anti-TNFa (-33 %) was not significantly different from patients with prior treatment with infliximab and/or etanercept (-42 %). In the STEREO study, another prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study that evaluated the effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with active PsA, the median reduction in NAPSI score was 57 % in 259 patients with both active arthritis and nail psoriasis at 12 weeks [95]. NAPSI-50 was recorded in 54 % of patients with a baseline NAPSI score of at least 10. This study also searched for predictors of good clinical responses for arthritis, skin, and nail lesions. Nail disease turned out to be unable to predict good response of the arthritis.

(p21.1) The BELIEVE study and the REACH study are two randomized, double-blind, controlled studies in PP patients reporting on the efficacy of adalimumab in nail psoriasis [117][118][119][120][121]. A subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study of 457 patients also with nail psoriasis claimed a reduction in the NAPSI nail matrix component of 39 % and NAPSI nail bed component of 60 % at week 16 [117]. These results appear to contradict the overall NAPSI reduction of 40 % at week 16 because both the matrix and bed signs are equally important in the calculation of the overall NAPSI. Another subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study focussed on the influence of PsA on the efficacy of adalimumab [120]. Numerically larger decreases in mean NAPSI scores were observed over time for patients without a history of PsA compared with patients with a history of PsA; however, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Efficacy on nail psoriasis has been a secondary endpoint in the REACH study investigating adalimumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic PP of the hands and feet [119]. Target NAPSI in 28 patients with nail psoriasis had improved 50 and 54 % at weeks 16 and 28, respectively. In a post hoc analysis of the REACH study among 31 patients with nail psoriasis, a greater percentage of adalimumab-treated patients achieved NAPSI-50 (56.5 %) versus placebo (12.5 %) at week 16 [121]. A remarkable finding in this study was that NAPSI-50 responders experienced a greater mean reduction in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score (86.1 %) than NAPSI-50 non-nesponders (1.4 %) among patients treated with adalimumab.

(p21.2) Daily practice studies were published by Sola-Ortigosa et al. [122], Bardazzi et al. [123], and Kyriakou et al. [124]. Prospective and retrospective studies comparing several systemic and biologic therapies have been conducted and will be discussed in Sect. 9. The efficacy of adalimumab in these trials is in the same range as in the above-mentioned studies [79,84,125,126]. Briefly, Ozmen et al. [125] reported a reduction in NAPSI of 54 % in eight patients receiving adalimumab at 48 weeks, Saraceno et al. [126] reported a NAPSI reduction of 66 % in 20 adalimumabtreated patients, and in the eight patients reported by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was 37, 73, and 84 % at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, respectively. Finally, after 12 months of treatment, Karanikolas et al. [84] reported NAPSI-50 in 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs. Summarizing these results, it is clear that adalimumab is an effective treatment for psoriasis of the nail bed and the nail plate, both in PP patients and in PsA patients. The most commonly reported side effects of adalimumab are comparable with those of other biologics. A prospective study was unable to see an increased incidence of onychomycosis in psoriasis patients treated with adalimumab for 24 weeks [103].

No differences in efficacy were seen between patients with PP only and patients with both PP and PsA. Another open-label study investigated the efficacy of adalimumab in 259 PsA patients only [116]. At week 12, NAPSI improvement in patients naive for anti-TNFa (-33 %) was not significantly different from patients with prior treatment with infliximab and/or etanercept (-42 %). In the STEREO study, another prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study that evaluated the effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with active PsA, the median reduction in NAPSI score was 57 % in 259 patients with both active arthritis and nail psoriasis at 12 weeks [95]. NAPSI-50 was recorded in 54 % of patients with a baseline NAPSI score of at least 10. This study also searched for predictors of good clinical responses for arthritis, skin, and nail lesions. Nail disease turned out to be unable to predict good response of the arthritis.

(p21.10) The BELIEVE study and the REACH study are two randomized, double-blind, controlled studies in PP patients reporting on the efficacy of adalimumab in nail psoriasis [117][118][119][120][121]. A subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study of 457 patients also with nail psoriasis claimed a reduction in the NAPSI nail matrix component of 39 % and NAPSI nail bed component of 60 % at week 16 [117]. These results appear to contradict the overall NAPSI reduction of 40 % at week 16 because both the matrix and bed signs are equally important in the calculation of the overall NAPSI. Another subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study focussed on the influence of PsA on the efficacy of adalimumab [120]. Numerically larger decreases in mean NAPSI scores were observed over time for patients without a history of PsA compared with patients with a history of PsA; however, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Efficacy on nail psoriasis has been a secondary endpoint in the REACH study investigating adalimumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic PP of the hands and feet [119]. Target NAPSI in 28 patients with nail psoriasis had improved 50 and 54 % at weeks 16 and 28, respectively. In a post hoc analysis of the REACH study among 31 patients with nail psoriasis, a greater percentage of adalimumab-treated patients achieved NAPSI-50 (56.5 %) versus placebo (12.5 %) at week 16 [121]. A remarkable finding in this study was that NAPSI-50 responders experienced a greater mean reduction in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score (86.1 %) than NAPSI-50 non-nesponders (1.4 %) among patients treated with adalimumab.

(p21.11) Daily practice studies were published by Sola-Ortigosa et al. [122], Bardazzi et al. [123], and Kyriakou et al. [124]. Prospective and retrospective studies comparing several systemic and biologic therapies have been conducted and will be discussed in Sect. 9. The efficacy of adalimumab in these trials is in the same range as in the above-mentioned studies [79,84,125,126]. Briefly, Ozmen et al. [125] reported a reduction in NAPSI of 54 % in eight patients receiving adalimumab at 48 weeks, Saraceno et al. [126] reported a NAPSI reduction of 66 % in 20 adalimumabtreated patients, and in the eight patients reported by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was 37, 73, and 84 % at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, respectively. Finally, after 12 months of treatment, Karanikolas et al. [84] reported NAPSI-50 in 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs. Summarizing these results, it is clear that adalimumab is an effective treatment for psoriasis of the nail bed and the nail plate, both in PP patients and in PsA patients. The most commonly reported side effects of adalimumab are comparable with those of other biologics. A prospective study was unable to see an increased incidence of onychomycosis in psoriasis patients treated with adalimumab for 24 weeks [103].
## (s23) Golimumab
(p23.0) Golimumab is a human monoclonal anti-TNFa antibody that has a registration for the treatment of PsA but not for PP. In an RCT in PsA patients-the GO-REVEAL studynail involvement was a secondary endpoint (Table 3) [133]. Approximately half of the patients were also taking methotrexate. In patients treated with the common dose of golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks, improvement was reported both in target NAPSI (-43 %), and PGA (-48 %) at 24 weeks. Target NAPSI improvement was even slightly higher (-52 %) at 52 weeks [134].

## (s24) Certolizumab Pegol
(p24.0) Certolizumab pegol is a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to TNFa that is chemically modified by PEGylation, resulting in a final product that has a prolonged halflife in patients. In the maintenance phase of treatment, patients receive one dose every 2-4 weeks, which is slightly less frequent than with other anti-TNFa antibodies. It is registered for PsA patients but several trials in PP patients are ongoing. The RAPID-PsA study was an RCT investigating certolizumab pegol in PsA patients in which psoriatic nail involvement was a secondary endpoint [135]. As in many studies primarily focussing on PsA, concomitant use of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or oral corticosteroids was permitted. Mean target NAPSI change from baseline at week 24 was -52 % with certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks and -59 % with certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks versus -32 % with placebo (p = 0.003 and p \ 0.001, respectively) [ Table 3]. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and pruritus.

## (s25) Anti-Interleukin (IL)-17 Treatments
(p25.0) Fundamental immunological research pointed to a central pathogenic pathway in which IL-17A is the most critical T-cell-derived cytokine in altering skin function, while, in turn, IL-17-producing T cells (T17 cells) are regulated by IL-23. There is thus an intimate link between dissection of pathogenic pathways for psoriasis and new emerging therapies for this disease [136]. Several clinical trials in PP have suggested this concept being correct (Table 3) [137][138][139], but others have criticized some of these trials [140,141]. Two IL-17 neutralizing agents (i.e. secukinumab and ixekizumab) have been investigated in nail psoriasis. Common adverse effects of anti-IL-17 treatments are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. Secukinumab may exacerbate Crohn's disease, and anaphylaxis and cases of urticaria are reported. These drugs should be used with caution in patients with chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, and all patients should be evaluated for TB before initiating.

## (s26) Secukinumab
(p26.0) Secukinumab is a human monoclonal IgG1 k antibody that targets IL-17A and has been approved for the treatment of PP and PsA. Little is known about the efficacy of secukinumab in nail psoriasis. One subanalysis of a dose-finding RCT reported secukinumab improvement of nail lesions in moderate to severe PP [139]. Unfortunately, the NAPSI scale was not used but rather a never before described composite score (range 0-20) was used, and no patients were treated using the eventually approved dose for PP. From this study, no conclusions on efficacy in nail psoriasis can be drawn; patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg at baseline and weeks 1, 2, and 4 had an improvement of 19 % in the composite fingernail score. In patients treated with 150 mg at baseline and weeks 4 and 8, this improvement was 11 % (Table 3). A multicenter RCT investigating the efficacy of subcutaneous secukinumab 150 and 300 mg at 16 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe nail psoriasis has recently been conducted but the results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. This TRANSFIGURE study also assesses safety, tolerability and long-term efficacy up to 132 weeks.

## (s27) Ixekizumab
(p27.0) Ixekizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-17A intended to treat PP. Although this drug does not yet have a registration, some data are available suggesting efficacy in nail psoriasis (Table 3) [142]. Significant reductions in NAPSI scores were observed as early as 2 weeks, and these effects were sustained through 20 weeks. At 12 weeks, NAPSI had decreased significantly (-57 %) in patients treated with ixekizumab 75 mg at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12. The same patients have also been reported in an open-label extension receiving 120 mg of ixekizumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks from week 20, however only in patients not achieving a PASI 75 [143]. In these patients, mean NAPSI had improved 78 % at week 24 of the extension (week 44 of the trial), and 79 % at week 48 of the extension (week 68 of the trial). Complete clearance of the nails was achieved in a high proportions of patients: 43 % at week 44, and 51 % at week 68. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and injection site erythema.

## (s28) Anti-IL-12/23 Treatments
(p28.0) Ustekinumab is the only anti-IL-12/23 treatment currently available for the treatment of PP and PsA. This antibody binds with high specificity and affinity to the shared p40 protein subunit of cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, blocking the differentiation and expansion of Th1 and Th17 populations. Briakinumab is another human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12/23 being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis. Further development for psoriasis has been discontinued, possibly because of cardiovascular adverse events [144]. Clinical efficacy of briakimumab in nail psoriasis has been shown in an RCT in which it was compared with methotrexate (Table 3) [78]. At 24 weeks, target NAPSI improved 56 % in briakinumab-treated patients, and 38 % in methotrexate-treated patients.

## (s30) Comparative Studies with Systemic Therapies
(p30.0) As discussed above, biologics and conventional systemic treatments have been shown, in numerous studies, to be potent suppressors of psoriatic nail disease. The degree of improvement of clinical signs attributed to individual treatments is very different, even between different studies of the same drug. This makes it virtually impossible to compare results of distinct studies with different drugs. The explanations for these differences are manifold. The 'NAPSI' scoring systems used are extremely heterogeneous, the primary inclusion criterion for a study can be PP, PsA, or nail psoriasis, the quality of the studies differs, and some studies use very liberal criteria to define nail psoriasis, while others included only patients with severe psoriasis. Finally, the period of follow-up is of the utmost importance in the judgment of the results because further improvement may occur up to 1 year. These reasons underline the need for studies in which several treatments are compared, without other factors interfering with the outcome. It is desirable to have comparative doubleblinded RCTs but hitherto all comparative studies are retrospective studies or open, prospective studies. Nevertheless, these studies have supplied us with relevant information about efficacy and speed of conventional systemic therapy versus biologics, and about efficacy of conventional and anti-TNFa therapy compared with other drugs in the same group. Secukinumab and ustekinumab were not included in any of these studies; therefore, the relative effectiveness of these anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-12/23 biologics remain to be seen.

(p30.1) The results of a prospective study comparing anti-TNF biologics with acitretin, methotrexate, and narrowband (NB)-UVB phototherapy draws attention to the importance of adequate follow-up [80]. The short follow-up of only 16 weeks resulted in no significant change in NAPSI for any of the conventional therapies, contrary to the six patients receiving anti-TNFa. On the other hand, this study also showed that patience is more important when using conventional therapies than using biologics. These differences in speed between biologics and conventional treatments (with the exception of cyclosporine) were also noted by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], whose retrospective study compared phototherapy and several systemic and biologic therapies: acitretin, methotrexate, cyclosporine, PUVA, NB-UVB, retinoid (RE)-PUVA, RE-NB-UVB, infliximab, efalizumab, etanercept, or adalimumab [79]. Significant reductions were identified in the mean NAPSI scores at 12, 24, and 48 weeks for all antipsoriatic agents, with the exception of NB-UVB. In the group treated with conventional systemic drugs, nail psoriasis improvement was significantly higher in patients treated with cyclosporine (p \ 0.01) than in those treated with acitretin, methotrexate, PUVA, and RE-NUVB at 12 and 24 weeks. In the biological treatment group, differences between distinct biological treatments had disappeared at 48 weeks, although the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was significantly greater with infliximab and adalimumab at 12 and 24 weeks. Cyclosporine was as effective as infliximab and adalimumab. Similar efficacy of cyclosporine and adalimumab was also concluded from a prospective comparison of adalimumab with cyclosporine in PsA patients also suffering from nail psoriasis [84]. Patients were treated with cyclosporine, adalimumab (40 mg every other week), or a combination of cyclosporine and adalimumab. After 12 months of treatment, NAPSI-50 was achieved in 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs.

(p30.2) Other comparative studies included only biologics. Two open, randomized, prospective studies investigated infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in a limited number of patients [125,126]. After 48 weeks of treatment, Ozmen et al. reported a reduction in NAPSI of 40, 57, and 54 % in patients receiving infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, respectively (not significant) [125]. Saraceno et al. studied the efficacy and differences in efficacy of the same three anti-TNFa treatments in 60 patients with moderate nail psoriasis [126]. At 24 weeks (the end of follow-up in this study), no significant differences between the three biologics could be measured, but mean NAPSI had reduced to 91 % in infliximab-treated patients, 70 % in etanercepttreated patients, and 66 % in adalimumab-treated patients. However, at week 14, efficacy was higher in the infliximab group compared with the adalimumab and etanercept groups. NAPSI-75 could be achieved in 65, 45, and 50 % of patients treated for 24 weeks with infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, respectively. The lack of major differences in efficacy on nail psoriasis can also be concluded from several daily practice and retrospective studies [122][123][124]. Sola-Ortigosa et al. measured a NAPSI improvement of 57 % in 15 patients after 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment [122], while the study of Bardazzi et al. in 16 patients receiving adalimumab showed a better NAPSI response at this time point (-89 %), and 94 % NAPSI improvement at 36 weeks follow-up [123]. The third retrospective study comparing the efficacy of anti-TNFa biologics on nail psoriasis also failed to show differences between infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in 39 patients [124]. After 48 weeks of treatment, a reduction in NAPSI of 95, 92, and 87 %, respectively, was observed. One retrospective study focusing on determining which biologic is the most effective in the treatment of nail psoriasis also included ustekinumab [123]. At 36 weeks, no significant differences were seen in the reduction of NAPSI, and the percentage of patients achieving NAPSI-75 (89 %) was also similar in all groups.
## (s31) Laser Therapy
(p31.0) Laser treatment is an emerging physical therapy option claiming an indication in increasing numbers of skin and nail disorders. In nail psoriasis, PDL (595 nm) treatments are also offered. A positive clinical effect of the laser is supposed to be caused by its effect on angiogenesis and vascularity within the psoriatic nail unit. Several case reports and clinical studies have been reported [57,[151][152][153][154][155], and the results of these reports are rather contradictory. While some authors claim effects mainly on nail bed psoriasis [155], others see more positive results on nail matrix psoriasis [57,[152][153][154], or even negative effects on nail bed psoriasis [57]. The reported NAPSI improvement by laser therapy ranges from a disappointing 2 % at 6 months [57] to a sensational 86 % at 1 month [155]. In addition, a rapid decrease in NAPSI, followed by a significant increase after the third month of treatment despite ongoing treatment, has been reported [154]. Several protocols to treat nail psoriasis with PDL have been advocated but comparisons did not show significant differences between 6-ms pulse duration, 9 J/cm 2 , 7 mm spot size, and 0.45-ms, 6 J/cm 2 , 7 mm spot size [152,154]. Combining PDL with photodynamic therapy [153] or tazarotene [57] has been studied. Additional photodynamic therapy with methylaminolevulinic acid or tazarotene did not significantly change the NAPSI results; however, a significantly higher percentage of patients had improvement in PGA and SGA scores after 6 months of treatment with topical tazarotene plus PDL than after tazarotene treatment alone.

(p31.1) The major side effect of PDL treatment is pain, which may last for 24 h. Other adverse events are petechiae and hyperpigmentation in 30 % of the nail folds, i.e. in virtually all patients. Pain, but also petechiae, is worse if a longer pulse duration is chosen. Summarizing these often conflicting results with PDL, one must conclude that a randomized study comparing PDL treatment with sham laser treatment is urgently needed to justify this painful treatment in patients with nail psoriasis.

## (s46) Assessment of Nail Psoriasis
(p46.0) The availability of sensitive, responsive, specific, and validated outcome measures is essential in drug research and comparison of trials. Unfortunately, these are still missing in nail psoriasis. Most recent studies on nail psoriasis use the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), target NAPSI, or one of its many variants as a marker of nail improvement [23]. To calculate the NAPSI, each nail is divided into four quadrants, each of which are evaluated for the presence of any manifestations of psoriasis in the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, nail plate crumbling) and nail bed (oil-drop discoloration, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, splinter hemorrhages). If any sign is present in all four quadrants, the nail is given a score of 4, through to a score of 0 if there are no signs in any quadrant. Each nail is assigned a nail matrix and a nail bed score of 0-4, which are combined to yield a total score of 0-8 for each nail. All nails may be evaluated, with the total NAPSI score being the sum of the scores, up to 80 if only fingers (10 nails) are considered, or up to 160 if toes are also included (20 nails). In clinical studies, often only the most seriously involved nail is targeted (target NAPSI) to assess the effects of drug therapy. Some studies use (target) NAPSI-50, NAPSI-75, and NAPSI-90 to indicate the percentage of patients achieving a (target) NAPSI improvement of at least 50, 75, or 90 %, respectively. Despite its current popularity in nail psoriasis studies, the NAPSI has some disadvantages. Its poor validation, the fact that the important nail psoriasis feature 'subungual hyperkeratosis' is not included and, in particular, the lack of correspondence of NAPSI scores with the clinical severity of nail psoriasis are important disadvantages of this scoring system [24]. Most of these limitations are absent in a newly developed scoring system, the N-NAIL, which has been partly validated [24]; however, this system has not been used in any published clinical studies. Older studies have used many different scoring systems, which, together with the major differences in study design, inclusion criteria, and follow-up, make it difficult to compare the results of individual trials. Furthermore, not only should clinical severity be part of a core outcome set in nail psoriasis but, ideally, it should also involve patient-assessed signs, QoL, patient satisfaction with treatment and outcome, adverse events, and probably costs. A first attempt at developing a tool for the assessment of various domains of nail psoriasis outcomes, known as Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (NAPPA), has recently been published [25].

## (s47) Management of Nail Psoriasis
(p47.0) Treating nail psoriasis is often a time-consuming challenge with an unsecure outcome. Response to treatment may appear everywhere in the spectrum, from very disappointing to excellent, but relapses are common. Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence-based treatments and consequent guidelines [15]. This does not necessarily mean that available treatments are not efficacious, but that final statistical evidence is missing. Therapeutic options include patient education, external topical treatments, intralesional steroids, systemic treatments, and non-pharmacological treatment options. Patient education should cover the avoidance of minor repetitive nail trauma, managing expectations with regard to the amount of time necessary for nail clearing, and discussing prevention and treatment of fungal infections in psoriasis nails [26]. Psoriatic nail changes can be provoked by minor traumas, such as nail biting, subungual cleaning, picking, or manicure. Patients should avoid these habits and keep the nails as short as possible to prevent trauma or lifting of the poorly attached nail plate [27]. Before the start of treatment, the clinician should discuss with the patient that any noticeable nail improvement will take a long time; many treatments will show maximal results only after 1 year. The low growth rate of the nail plate is responsible for a delay of 3-9 months before clinical improvement can be noticed in cases of effective treatment. Four to 6 months is a reasonable period of treatment before evaluating clinically relevant results. In the beginning, the improvement may be so limited that it is advisable to take photographs of the nails during each visit to convince both the patient and the physician that the treatment has positive results. Concomitant onychomycosis has a high prevalence in psoriatic nails. A meta-analysis has shown a prevalence of 18.0 % in psoriasis patients compared with a prevalence of 9.1 % in control groups [28]. This high prevalence rate should be a reason for excluding onychomycosis before starting intensive treatment for nail psoriasis. Obviously, treatment of concomitant onychomycosis will improve the outcome of all other treatments.

(p47.1) The choice of treatments depends on clinical presentation, as well as patient-related factors. Most patients have only mild nail psoriasis without signs of PsA or severe PP. These patients may profit from topical treatment, while systemic treatment is indicated in patients with severe nail psoriasis, major impact on QoL, or concomitant moderate to severe psoriatic skin lesions. Systemic therapy should also be favored if concomitant PsA is evident. The choice of treatments further depends on patient factors, including age, experienced burden of disease, accompanying diseases and therapies, individual patient preferences, and the risks of treatment.

(p47.2) This review covers treatment options for nail psoriasis and is the result of a systemic approach to the literature. The following databases were searched (to December 2015): the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, and Pubmed (from 1948). Essentially, the search strategy included psoria*, and (nail*, or toenail* or thumbnail*, or ungual, or unguel, or unguium, or pitting, or punctate, or Beau's lines, or subungual hyperkeratosis, or onycholysis) and (trial). Overall, 120 publications were identified using this search strategy. The titles and abstracts of each of these publications were evaluated and a total of 72 studies or case reports on the treatment of nail psoriasis were selected for complete reviewing. Publications without original data were discarded. In addition, the reference lists of all publications were checked, which resulted in an 69 additional publications. The number of additional publications retrieved by checking reference lists was high, and was mainly caused by the fact that nail psoriasis was often a secondary endpoint in studies on PP or PsA, and was not mentioned in the abstract.

In the beginning, the improvement may be so limited that it is advisable to take photographs of the nails during each visit to convince both the patient and the physician that the treatment has positive results. Concomitant onychomycosis has a high prevalence in psoriatic nails. A meta-analysis has shown a prevalence of 18.0 % in psoriasis patients compared with a prevalence of 9.1 % in control groups [28]. This high prevalence rate should be a reason for excluding onychomycosis before starting intensive treatment for nail psoriasis. Obviously, treatment of concomitant onychomycosis will improve the outcome of all other treatments.

(p47.10) The choice of treatments depends on clinical presentation, as well as patient-related factors. Most patients have only mild nail psoriasis without signs of PsA or severe PP. These patients may profit from topical treatment, while systemic treatment is indicated in patients with severe nail psoriasis, major impact on QoL, or concomitant moderate to severe psoriatic skin lesions. Systemic therapy should also be favored if concomitant PsA is evident. The choice of treatments further depends on patient factors, including age, experienced burden of disease, accompanying diseases and therapies, individual patient preferences, and the risks of treatment.

(p47.11) This review covers treatment options for nail psoriasis and is the result of a systemic approach to the literature. The following databases were searched (to December 2015): the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, and Pubmed (from 1948). Essentially, the search strategy included psoria*, and (nail*, or toenail* or thumbnail*, or ungual, or unguel, or unguium, or pitting, or punctate, or Beau's lines, or subungual hyperkeratosis, or onycholysis) and (trial). Overall, 120 publications were identified using this search strategy. The titles and abstracts of each of these publications were evaluated and a total of 72 studies or case reports on the treatment of nail psoriasis were selected for complete reviewing. Publications without original data were discarded. In addition, the reference lists of all publications were checked, which resulted in an 69 additional publications. The number of additional publications retrieved by checking reference lists was high, and was mainly caused by the fact that nail psoriasis was often a secondary endpoint in studies on PP or PsA, and was not mentioned in the abstract.
## (s49) Topical Corticosteroids
(p49.0) Topical corticosteroids have been used for many decades to suppress psoriatic inflammation in PP. Also in nail psoriasis, potent and superpotent corticosteroids are used frequently, and appear to be more effective in nail matrix psoriasis than in nail bed psoriasis. Topical corticosteroids are available in the form of ointments, creams, lotions, emulsions, and even nail lacquers, and the frequency of application frequency is usually once or twice daily. If used frequently and for a prolonged period, telangiectasia of the surrounding skin and atrophy of the skin and underlying phalanx may appear. Others prefer pulse therapy, with application on four consecutive days each week, in order to prevent these side effects. Clinical improvement may not be expected within 4-6 months of treatment, and further improvement can be seen during the first year.

(p49.1) In spite of the long history of corticosteroids in the treatment of nail psoriasis, only a few formal trials of their efficacy have been conducted. Clinical studies on topical corticosteroid monotherapy are even sparser. RCTs using betamethasone dipropionate ointment (64 mg/g) twice daily [29,30] and clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily [31] identified positive effects on subungual hyperkeratosis, salmon patches, pitting, and onycholysis after 12-20 weeks of use. One study compared betamethasone dipropionate (64 mg/g) and salicylic acid (0.03 g/g) ointment with calcipotriol ointment (50 lg/g) in the treatment of nail bed psoriasis with severe subungual hyperkeratosis [30]. After 3 months of treatment, subungual fingernail and toenail hyperkeratosis was reduced by 20-30 % in both groups (no statistical differences). Rigopoulos et al. conducted an RCT comparing tazarotene 0.1 % cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily for 12 weeks [31]. Patients showed a significant improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. Mild side effects were reported in 18.8 % of the tazarotene-treated patients, including desquamation and erythema of the nail-fold skin, periungual irritation, paronychia, and irritation of the skin of the toe or finger distanced from the nail area. Formulations with corticosteroids in a nail lacquer have been studied more often than other forms but are not yet commercially available. In particular, 8 % clobetasol-17-propionate in a nail lacquer has shown positive results in placebo-controlled, open studies [32][33][34]. Fifty-two to 90 % of patients showed improvement after therapy, which was directly related to the length of treatment. The symptoms that responded best to therapy were onycholysis and pitting (indicating an action on the nail matrix); however, improvement of salmon patches and subungual hyperkeratosis has also been reported, whereas splinter hemorrhages were most persistent. No adverse effects, such as atrophy, hypochromy, periungual telangiectasia, local pain, and hypersensitivity, were noted.

(p49.2) Topical corticosteroids have been used for many decades to suppress psoriatic inflammation in PP. Also in nail psoriasis, potent and superpotent corticosteroids are used frequently, and appear to be more effective in nail matrix psoriasis than in nail bed psoriasis.

After 3 months of treatment, subungual fingernail and toenail hyperkeratosis was reduced by 20-30 % in both groups (no statistical differences). Rigopoulos et al. conducted an RCT comparing tazarotene 0.1 % cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily for 12 weeks [31].

## (s51) Intralesional Corticosteroids
(p51.0) Locally injected steroids have a long history in the treatment of nail psoriasis [40]. Locally penetrating doses of steroid into a digit are administered by needle injection or highpressure jet from a tool such as the 'Port-o-jet', 'Med-Jet MBX', or others. Needle injection is the most common of these, with the temporary popularity of the Port-o-jet waning as concern developed over the potential for splash-back of blood and steroid from the breached epidermis on to the instrument and practitioner, or the development of epidermal inclusion cysts. The existing evidence suggests that intralesional injection into the nail bed and matrix are particularly effective for alleviating lesions caused by psoriasis of the nail matrix, and also has moderate effects on nail bed signs ( Table 1). Injections in the region of the nail matrix has almost no effects on nail bed signs of nail psoriasis.

(p51.1) The recommended protocols of treatment differ considerably. Initially, injections of triamcinolone acetonide (5 mg/ml) were administered monthly for 6 months in the proximal nail fold, followed by a further four injections over the next 6 months and then every 2 months for the final 6-to 12-month period [40][41][42][43]. More recent publications prefer a higher concentration of triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/ml), 0.1 ml administered in each of the four periungual sites, ensuring symmetrical delivery of the steroid to the nail matrix and nail bed, and administered less frequently, such as every 2 months [44,45]. Clinical results of this modified regimen were investigated in two studies suggesting improved efficacy on the signs of nail bed psoriasis (Table 1) [44,45].

(p51.2) Side effects after these procedures are well known: short-term paresthesia [44,45] and focal pain that may last for several months [40,45]; hematoma formation is rather common (up to 20 %) but asymptomatic [45]. Loss of the nail plate was seen in 9 % of patients in one study [45]. Occasionally, nail-fold atrophy can be encountered, and is often reversible. Chronic topical therapy can lead to complications of the 'disappearing digit' [46] with atrophy of the underlying phalanx [47]. Rupture of the extensor tendon has also been reported after local injection of steroids [48,49].

## (s52) Vitamin D3 Derivates: Calcipotriol, Tacalcitol, Calcitriol
(p52.0) Vitamin D analogs regulate epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as production and release of proinflammatory cytokines. Topical formulations containing vitamin D3 (calcitriol) and vitamin D analogs (calcipotriol, tacalcitol) are effective treatments for PP, both as monotherapies and in fixed combinations with corticosteroids. Vitamin D3 derivates appear to be more effective in treating nail bed signs of psoriasis than in nail matrix signs. Studies using calcitriol in the treatment of nail psoriasis are rare. One case was reported whereby the patient responded well to treatment with calcitriol ointment [50]; however, it was not completely clear whether this patient suffered from nail psoriasis. One RCT compared calcitriol ointment (3 lg/g) twice daily with betamethasone diproprionate (64 mg/g) on subungual hyperkeratosis [29]. After 20 weeks, nails treated with calcitriol had a 38 % reduction in thickness compared with a 35 % reduction seen in nails treated with betamethasone diproprionate (not significant). Tacalcitol is a chemical vitamin D analog that has been investigated as a monotherapy in one open study of 15 patients with both nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis [51]. Patients used the tacalcitol ointment (4 lg/g) every night in occlusion (with cotton gloves) for 6 months. After 3 months, the NAPSI dropped more than 50 %, and after 6 months of treatment the NAPSI was approximately 75 % lower than at baseline. Most patients presented with pain at the beginning of the study, but none reported discomfort after 6 months. Surprisingly, the greatest improvement was seen in nail matrix signs of nail psoriasis. Combining tacalcitol ointment (10 lg/g) with a nail lacquer containing 8 % clobetasol-17-propionate (twice weekly) resulted in major improvement of both nail bed and nail matrix signs [39].

(p52.1) Calcipotriol is the vitamin D analog most widely investigated in nail psoriasis, often in combination with other treatments but also as monotherapy. One case-series study evaluated the efficacy of calcipotriol ointment (50 lg/g) monotherapy twice daily without occlusion in the treatment of nail psoriasis for 5 months [52]. Calcipotriol was particularly effective in nail bed signs of subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and discoloration. In addition, fingertip tenderness and pain of an involved distal phalanx were significantly reduced. In a 12-week study comparing calcipotriol (50 lg/g) monotherapy with calcipotriol/betamethasone-dipropionate combination therapy, only oil-drop discoloration improved, without differences between the two groups [36]. The same two compounds in a single ointment resulted in a 72 % NAPSI improvement at 12 weeks in patients with extremely mild nail psoriasis [37]. Other studies of combination therapy of calcipotriol and corticosteroids are discussed in Sect. 5.2.
## (s53) Tazarotene
(p53.0) Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids that is selective for b and c isotypes of the retinoic acid receptor. It has been shown to have antiproliferative, normalizing-of-differentiation, and anti-inflammatory effects, and is approved for the treatment of psoriasis, acne, and photodamage. Several studies have been performed to estimate efficacy in nail psoriasis [31,[54][55][56][57].

(p53.1) In these studies, tazarotene 0.1 % gel, ointment, or cream was used once daily for 12-24 weeks. In one study, tazarotene was effective for onycholysis and pitting (only if applied under occlusion) at 24 weeks, but not for subungual hyperkeratosis, leukonychia, nail plate crumbling/loss, or splinter hemorrhages [54]; however, other studies saw an improvement in hyperkeratosis and oil spots [55,58]. A better response of nail bed signs than nail matrix signs was also concluded from another study [56]. An 88 % improvement in NAPSI at 6 months was reported from this study, but patients had only mild nail psoriasis at baseline (median NAPSI 15). Rigopoulos et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind study comparing tazarotene cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream, both under occlusion [31]. The results of this study showed a significant time-effect improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. The most recent study investigating tazarotene in nail psoriasis compared the efficacy of pulsed dye laser (PDL) plus topical tazarotene cream versus topical tazarotene alone [57]. After 6 months of tazarotene treatment without occlusion, no improvement in nail bed or nail matrix psoriasis could be observed. An explanation for this failure might be the fact that most patients were also receiving systemic therapy or using phototherapy. The laser results will be discussed in Sect. 10.1. From these studies, tazarotene appears to be effective for nail bed signs of psoriasis only. Use may be limited by the preferred use under occlusion and by the relatively frequently occurring side effects, such as erythema, irritation, desquamation, and paronychia.

Several studies have been performed to estimate efficacy in nail psoriasis [31,[54][55][56][57].

(p53.7) In these studies, tazarotene 0.1 % gel, ointment, or cream was used once daily for 12-24 weeks. In one study, tazarotene was effective for onycholysis and pitting (only if applied under occlusion) at 24 weeks, but not for subungual hyperkeratosis, leukonychia, nail plate crumbling/loss, or splinter hemorrhages [54]; however, other studies saw an improvement in hyperkeratosis and oil spots [55,58]. A better response of nail bed signs than nail matrix signs was also concluded from another study [56]. An 88 % improvement in NAPSI at 6 months was reported from this study, but patients had only mild nail psoriasis at baseline (median NAPSI 15). Rigopoulos et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind study comparing tazarotene cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream, both under occlusion [31]. The results of this study showed a significant time-effect improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. The most recent study investigating tazarotene in nail psoriasis compared the efficacy of pulsed dye laser (PDL) plus topical tazarotene cream versus topical tazarotene alone [57]. After 6 months of tazarotene treatment without occlusion, no improvement in nail bed or nail matrix psoriasis could be observed. An explanation for this failure might be the fact that most patients were also receiving systemic therapy or using phototherapy. The laser results will be discussed in Sect. 10.1. From these studies, tazarotene appears to be effective for nail bed signs of psoriasis only. Use may be limited by the preferred use under occlusion and by the relatively frequently occurring side effects, such as erythema, irritation, desquamation, and paronychia.
## (s54) Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors
(p54.0) Calcineurin is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that activates T cells by upregulation of the expression of IL-2. Increased IL-2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cell responses. Systemic inhibition of calcineurin, particularly with cyclosporine, has been shown to be an effective treatment for PP [59]. The use of systemic calcineurin inhibitors in psoriasis is limited by potential severe side effects; however, topical treatment of nail psoriasis with calcineurin inhibitors could prevent the majority of these side effects. Several case reports and studies using topical cyclosporine and tacrolimus have been published [60][61][62]. In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, nails of eight patients were treated twice daily for 12 weeks with a 70 mg/ml maize-oil-dissolved oral cyclosporine solution [61]. This study showed excellent results in the majority of patients; mean improvement was 77 % in the cyclosporine-treated group and 12 % in the placebo-treated group. Improvement was noted both in nail matrix signs of nail psoriasis (pitting) and in nail bed signs (hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, crumbling, and oil-drop discoloration). No local or systemic side effects were detectable, but nails may turn yellowish after long-term application of cyclosporine in maize oil. These positive results were rather surprising considering the known issue of difficult penetration of cyclosporine through the skin and the nail due to its highly lipophilic nature and size of the molecule [63]. Later, Prins et al. reported pharmaceutical instability of the used topical cyclosporine emulsion for nail psoriasis within 4 h after preparation [64]. According to this study, patients should homogenize the emulsion before each application in order to prevent treatment failure. An unpublished study from Rotterdam, The Netherlands, sponsored by Novartis (ISRCTN47031769) tried to confirm the positive results of cyclosporine on nail psoriasis, but the investigators were unable to find differences between the cyclosporine-treated nails and the maize-oiltreated nails (personal communication).

(p54.1) Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor with much better skin-penetrating capacities than cyclosporine. In a 12-week randomized, controlled, open-label study, the efficacy and safety of topical treatment with tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment was assessed in 21 patients with nail psoriasis [62]. Application was once daily at bedtime onto the nail folds of affected nails, without occlusion, and patients were instructed not to wash their hands until the next morning. The severity of nail psoriasis improved significantly, as measured by overall NAPSI (-57 %) and target NAPSI (-65 %). Tacrolimus ointment proved to be equally effective on nail bed and nail matrix features. One patient was withdrawn from tacrolimus application after 9 weeks because of the appearance of acute paronychia. No other side effects were recorded in the observation time.These results suggest that topical tacrolimus is one of the more effective and tolerable treatments for both nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis, but these results need confirmation from additional studies.

## (s55) Anthralin
(p55.0) Anthralin (dithranol) was first synthesized as a derivative of chrysarobin, prepared from the araroba tree in Brazil over a century ago. It is an effective treatment of skin lesions in psoriasis by inhibiting keratinocyte hyperproliferation and interfering with several relevant steps of the immune system [65]. In one uncontrolled study, 20 psoriasis patients with nail involvement were treated with topical anthralin therapy [66]. An ointment of anthralin in petrolatum was applied to the affected nail bed once daily and then washed away with water after 30 min. Therapy was started with 0.4 % anthralin, and in case of lack of improvement, the concentration was gradually increased up to 2.0 %. Within 5 months of therapy, approximately half of the patients showed good improvement of nail bed signs of onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and thickening of the nail. In addition, pitting, a nail matrix sign of nail psoriasis, had improved, which is surprising since only the nail bed had been treated. Longitudinal lines or transverse lines were unresponsive. A disturbing side effect of anthralin therapy was reversible pigmentation of the nail plate, in particular accumulating in the pits. This hyperpigmentation could be reduced, but not abolished, with 10 % triethanolamine cream applied after washing away the anthralin cream.

## (s58) Methotrexate
(p58.0) As an orally or subcutaneously administered systemic compound, methotrexate is one of the most used systemic treatments in PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis. It is cost effective and its efficacy in PP and PsA has been known for many years [59]. A wide range of potential side effects limit its use, including hepatotoxicity, ulcerative stomatitis, lymphopenia, nausea, low white blood cell count, and nausea. Studies focussing on methotrexate in nail psoriasis show efficacy, but significantly less than most biologics ( Table 2) [77][78][79][80]. One RCT comparing methotrexate and cyclosporine in nail psoriasis showed a mean NAPSI improvement of 43 % in methotrexate-treated patients and 37 % in cyclosporine-treated patients at 24 weeks (not significant) [77]. The methotrexate group showed a significant improvement in nail matrix scores only, while the cyclosporine group showed significant improvement in nail bed scores only [77]. Methotrexate efficacy to treat nail psoriasis has also been compared with briakinumab in an RCT [78]. Target NAPSI improved 38 % in methotrexatetreated patients and 56 % in briakinumab-treated patients. Patients were treated with an extremely slowly increasing dose of methotrexate for 24 weeks, which might have had a negative impact on outcome. Smaller, non-controlled studies showed NAPSI improvements in the same range [79,80].

## (s59) Cyclosporine
(p59.0) The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine is a powerful immunosuppressive drug that, in dermatology, has a position in the treatment of several disorders, such as severe eczema, PP, and alopecia areata. Topical use of cyclosporine in nail psoriasis has been discussed in Sect. 5.6, but systemic use has also been the topic of several reports that, despite the lack of efficacy in PsA, show reasonable efficacy in the treatment of both nail bed and nail matrix signs of psoriasis [53,79,[81][82][83][84]. One study indicated more efficacy of cyclosporine in nail bed psoriasis than in nail matrix psoriasis [77]. The efficacy of cyclosporine in comparison with other drugs has been reported in several studies. While Gumusel et al., who used the NAPSI as a scoring system, were unable to see significant differences between cyclosporine and methotrexate, most other studies used uncommon endpoints [77]. Mahrle et al. reported on a study of cyclosporine versus an obsolete retinoid-etretinate-using an unspecified 4-point scale [82]. Nail involvement had decreased by 46 and 34 % compared with baseline after 22 weeks of treatment with cyclosporine and etretinate, respectively. A 12-month comparison of cyclosporine with an anti-TNFa biologic-adalimumab-in PsA patients also suffering from nail psoriasis showed a NAPSI-50 in 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs [84]. The finding that cyclosporine was comparable to biologics in treating nail psoriasis was also confirmed in a retrospective database study: cyclosporine was the most effective classical systemic treatment; NAPSI improved 89 % at 48 weeks of treatment [79]. Concomitant use of cyclosporine and topical calcipotriol cream three times daily may further improve treatment results [53]. While most studies use doses between 3 and 5 mg/day, one study from Japan investigated a lower dose of cyclosporine per day; the initial dose of 3 mg/kg/day was successfully reduced to 1.5 mg/kg/day in responders [83]. Cyclosporine use may be limited by the relatively high rates of side effects; the most serious adverse reactions are mostly reversible renal dysfunction and hypertension. Other side effects include fatigue, headache, paresthesia, hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia, and gastrointestinal disorders. After prolonged use, cyclosporine may play a role in the development of renal failure and several malignancies. For this reason, it is often considered as an effective treatment for severe cases of (nail) psoriasis, but only for a period of 6-12 months.

Mahrle et al. reported on a study of cyclosporine versus an obsolete retinoid-etretinate-using an unspecified 4-point scale [82]. Nail involvement had decreased by 46 and 34 % compared with baseline after 22 weeks of treatment with cyclosporine and etretinate, respectively. A 12-month comparison of cyclosporine with an anti-TNFa biologic-adalimumab-in PsA patients also suffering from nail psoriasis showed a NAPSI-50 in 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs [84]. The finding that cyclosporine was comparable to biologics in treating nail psoriasis was also confirmed in a retrospective database study: cyclosporine was the most effective classical systemic treatment; NAPSI improved 89 % at 48 weeks of treatment [79]. Concomitant use of cyclosporine and topical calcipotriol cream three times daily may further improve treatment results [53]. While most studies use doses between 3 and 5 mg/day, one study from Japan investigated a lower dose of cyclosporine per day; the initial dose of 3 mg/kg/day was successfully reduced to 1.5 mg/kg/day in responders [83]. Cyclosporine use may be limited by the relatively high rates of side effects; the most serious adverse reactions are mostly reversible renal dysfunction and hypertension. Other side effects include fatigue, headache, paresthesia, hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia, and gastrointestinal disorders. After prolonged use, cyclosporine may play a role in the development of renal failure and several malignancies. For this reason, it is often considered as an effective treatment for severe cases of (nail) psoriasis, but only for a period of 6-12 months.
## (s60) Retinoids
(p60.0) Acitretin is a non-immunosuppressing antipsoriatic drug that can be used for years in patients who can tolerate its side effects, such as cheilitis, dry mouth, and skin exfoliation [85]. Acitretin normalizes cellular differentiation and controls inflammation. The position of acitretin in the treatment of nail psoriasis is that of a rather slow-acting compound with moderate efficacy and action, particularly on nail bed signs of psoriasis (Table 2) [79,80,82,86,87]. Two open studies and one retrospective analysis indicated that a NAPSI improvement of 40-50 % at 6-12 months may be expected [79,87]. At earlier time points, acitretin is considerably less effective [79,80]. Acitretin can also be used as an adjuvant therapy to psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB), as discussed in Sect. 10.3.

## (s61) Apremilast
(p61.0) Apremilast is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 that alters the expression of a variety of immune mediators [88]. It is USA FDA-and European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved for the treatment of adults with psoriasis and PsA. Two RCTs (ESTEEM 1 and 2) in which nail psoriasis was a secondary endpoint investigated its efficacy in nail psoriasis ( The general opinion is that it has little efficacy in nail psoriasis, but one case has been reported in which it was effective both on nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis [92]. Side effects are frequent in patients using FAEs, such as episodes of flushing, abdominal pain, and a decrease in lymphocyte count. Sulfasalazine is an aminosalicylate used as a traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of peripheral involvement in PsA. Sulfasalazine is metabolized by gut flora into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid, which act as anti-inflammatory agents. The role of sulfasalazine in cutaneous psoriatic lesions and nail psoriasis is not generally accepted. One case has been reported on the use of sulfasalazine in the treatment of psoriatic nail lesions [93]. After 3 months, nail lesions started to recede and disappeared progressively. No other cases have been reported in literature.

(p61.1) Leflunomide is another DMARD used to treat PsA. It is a de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor with immunomodulatory properties. One prospective study assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of leflunomide in patients with PsA, and also in psoriatic nail disease [94]. Unlike most studies on PP, patients in this study also received concomitant antiinflammatory/antirheumatic drugs, systemic corticosteroids, and other DMARDs, predominately methotrexate. Significant improvements were experienced in 32 % of patients with nail lesions. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea, alopecia, hypertension, and pruritus.

## (s62) Biologics
(p62.0) The introduction of biologics has led to a major step forward in the treatment of severe PP and PsA, and may have the potential to revolutionize the management of patients with disabling psoriatic nail disease. Anti-TNFa treatments were the first, very effective biologics that became available to psoriasis patients. More recently, other mechanisms of the psoriatic inflammatory reaction can be suppressed with anti-IL-17, and anti-IL-12/23 monoclonal antibodies. Consequently, the therapeutic armamentarium is expanding for patients with moderate to severe PP or PsA who are unresponsive to conventional systemic therapies or have contraindications for these therapies. Infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab are anti-TNFa treatments available both for PP and PsA patients, while golimumab and certolizumab pegol only have registration for PsA. The biologic ustekinumab, which targets IL-12/23, and the anti-IL-17 antibody secukinumab are also available for both PP and PsA. All these biologics appear to have a positive effect on nail psoriasis, without major differences in efficacy between the populations they are investigated in, i.e. PP or PsA (Table 3). In general, nail responses are slow but continue to improve, lagging behind cutaneous responses over time. While the onset of response in nail psoriasis is mostly noticeable after approximately 12 weeks, further improvement or even complete clearance can be seen through to 1 year of treatment. Nonetheless, nail, skin, and joint manifestations of psoriasis generally improved in parallel based on correlation between NAPSI, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses over time. Overall, patients with greater skin or joint responses also demonstrated better nail responses. On the other hand, the presence of nail disease was not shown to predict good response of the arthritis [95], and improvement of nail psoriasis by a biologic did not depend on the presence or absence of PsA [96].

## (s63) Inhibition of Tumor Necrosis Factor-a
(p63.0) TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in psoriasis by promoting an inflammatory infiltrate into the skin and inducing keratinocyte proliferation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis, which directly contributes to the characteristic skin and nail lesions. Anti-TNFa has shown to be a relatively safe and very effective treatment for PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis ( Table 3). The originally high cost of these treatments has limited their use in nail psoriasis, but since lower-cost biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept have been approved in the US and/or the EU they may become available to more patients with nail psoriasis. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol all appear to be effective treatments for nail psoriasis and will be discussed individually in the following sections. The most often reported adverse effects related to the use of TNFa antagonists are activation of opportune infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), demyelinating diseases, congestive heart failure, induction of the formation of autologous antibodies, and antibodies neutralizing anti-TNFa drugs [97]. The development of anti-TNFa-induced lupus or classical druginduced lupus is more rarely reported. Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.

## (s64) Infliximab
(p64.0) Infliximab was approved in the US in 1998 for the treatment of Crohn's disease. Thereafter, infliximab has had its indication expanded, and in 2005/2006 became available for the treatment of PsA and PP. It is a chimeric anti-TNFa immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that is comprised of human antibody constant regions and murine variable regions. Infliximab binds both soluble and membrane-bound TNFa, preventing it from binding its receptor, resulting in a decrease in epidermal T-cell infiltration. The chimeric character of infliximab may result in a higher formation of neutralizing antibodies than occurs with fully human(-ized) antibodies. A concern related to the formation of these antibodies is the decreased efficacy of infliximab over time, which may require increased infusion frequencies, higher doses to maintain a clinical response and disease control, and infusion reactions, occurring in 16 % of infliximab-treated patients [98]. These reactions can involve chills, fever, headache, flushing and urticaria, myalgia and arthralgia, nausea, dyspnoea, and hypotension [99][100][101]. Most infusion-related reactions are mild and can usually be ameliorated by reducing the rate of infusion rather than discontinuing therapy. However, anaphylactic reactions are also possible, requiring surveillance during and for 1 h after infusion. A type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction may also present 3-12 days after infusion and produce a serum sickness-like reaction [102]. A study comparing the incidence of onychomycosis inpatients      treated with infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab has shown a statistical positive association between fungal infections of the nail in psoriasis patients and the use of infliximab [103]. Thirty-three percent of patients receiving infliximab had a positive fungal culture, while in patients receiving etanercept and adalimumab, as well as controls, this percentage was 15.5, 13.3, and 13.9 %, respectively. Several studies have proven the beneficial effect of infliximab on nail psoriasis, both in PsA and PP patients, and also in patients with severe nail psoriasis at baseline (Table 3). No differences between efficacy in nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis have been reported. Patients with a high PASI response have a more rapid and profound nail response than patients with a poorer PASI response [104]. In addition, QoL improves during infliximab treatment in nail psoriasis [105].
## (s65) Adalimumab
(p65.0) PP and PsA are both indications for adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNFa IgG1 monoclonal antibody. On binding TNFa, adalimumab neutralizes the biological activities of this cytokine by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, and modulating biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNFa. Initially, its efficacy in nail psoriasis was claimed in a case report [115] but clinical studies have followed ( Table 3). The first study was an open-label study in patients with mild to moderate nail psoriasis [96]. After 24 weeks of treatment, the fingernail NAPSI had improved 85 %. No differences in efficacy were seen between patients with PP only and patients with both PP and PsA. Another open-label study investigated the efficacy of adalimumab in 259 PsA patients only [116]. At week 12, NAPSI improvement in patients naive for anti-TNFa (-33 %) was not significantly different from patients with prior treatment with infliximab and/or etanercept (-42 %). In the STEREO study, another prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study that evaluated the effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with active PsA, the median reduction in NAPSI score was 57 % in 259 patients with both active arthritis and nail psoriasis at 12 weeks [95]. NAPSI-50 was recorded in 54 % of patients with a baseline NAPSI score of at least 10. This study also searched for predictors of good clinical responses for arthritis, skin, and nail lesions. Nail disease turned out to be unable to predict good response of the arthritis.

(p65.1) The BELIEVE study and the REACH study are two randomized, double-blind, controlled studies in PP patients reporting on the efficacy of adalimumab in nail psoriasis [117][118][119][120][121]. A subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study of 457 patients also with nail psoriasis claimed a reduction in the NAPSI nail matrix component of 39 % and NAPSI nail bed component of 60 % at week 16 [117]. These results appear to contradict the overall NAPSI reduction of 40 % at week 16 because both the matrix and bed signs are equally important in the calculation of the overall NAPSI. Another subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study focussed on the influence of PsA on the efficacy of adalimumab [120]. Numerically larger decreases in mean NAPSI scores were observed over time for patients without a history of PsA compared with patients with a history of PsA; however, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Efficacy on nail psoriasis has been a secondary endpoint in the REACH study investigating adalimumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic PP of the hands and feet [119]. Target NAPSI in 28 patients with nail psoriasis had improved 50 and 54 % at weeks 16 and 28, respectively. In a post hoc analysis of the REACH study among 31 patients with nail psoriasis, a greater percentage of adalimumab-treated patients achieved NAPSI-50 (56.5 %) versus placebo (12.5 %) at week 16 [121]. A remarkable finding in this study was that NAPSI-50 responders experienced a greater mean reduction in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score (86.1 %) than NAPSI-50 non-nesponders (1.4 %) among patients treated with adalimumab.

(p65.2) Daily practice studies were published by Sola-Ortigosa et al. [122], Bardazzi et al. [123], and Kyriakou et al. [124]. Prospective and retrospective studies comparing several systemic and biologic therapies have been conducted and will be discussed in Sect. 9. The efficacy of adalimumab in these trials is in the same range as in the above-mentioned studies [79,84,125,126]. Briefly, Ozmen et al. [125] reported a reduction in NAPSI of 54 % in eight patients receiving adalimumab at 48 weeks, Saraceno et al. [126] reported a NAPSI reduction of 66 % in 20 adalimumabtreated patients, and in the eight patients reported by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was 37, 73, and 84 % at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, respectively. Finally, after 12 months of treatment, Karanikolas et al. [84] reported NAPSI-50 in 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs. Summarizing these results, it is clear that adalimumab is an effective treatment for psoriasis of the nail bed and the nail plate, both in PP patients and in PsA patients. The most commonly reported side effects of adalimumab are comparable with those of other biologics. A prospective study was unable to see an increased incidence of onychomycosis in psoriasis patients treated with adalimumab for 24 weeks [103].

(p65.3) PP and PsA are both indications for adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNFa IgG1 monoclonal antibody. On binding TNFa, adalimumab neutralizes the biological activities of this cytokine by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, and modulating biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNFa. Initially, its efficacy in nail psoriasis was claimed in a case report [115] but clinical studies have followed ( Table 3). The first study was an open-label study in patients with mild to moderate nail psoriasis [96]. After 24 weeks of treatment, the fingernail NAPSI had improved 85 %. No differences in efficacy were seen between patients with PP only and patients with both PP and PsA. Another open-label study investigated the efficacy of adalimumab in 259 PsA patients only [116]. At week 12, NAPSI improvement in patients naive for anti-TNFa (-33 %) was not significantly different from patients with prior treatment with infliximab and/or etanercept (-42 %). In the STEREO study, another prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study that evaluated the effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with active PsA, the median reduction in NAPSI score was 57 % in 259 patients with both active arthritis and nail psoriasis at 12 weeks [95]. NAPSI-50 was recorded in 54 % of patients with a baseline NAPSI score of at least 10. This study also searched for predictors of good clinical responses for arthritis, skin, and nail lesions. Nail disease turned out to be unable to predict good response of the arthritis.

(p65.4) The BELIEVE study and the REACH study are two randomized, double-blind, controlled studies in PP patients reporting on the efficacy of adalimumab in nail psoriasis [117][118][119][120][121]. A subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study of 457 patients also with nail psoriasis claimed a reduction in the NAPSI nail matrix component of 39 % and NAPSI nail bed component of 60 % at week 16 [117]. These results appear to contradict the overall NAPSI reduction of 40 % at week 16 because both the matrix and bed signs are equally important in the calculation of the overall NAPSI. Another subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study focussed on the influence of PsA on the efficacy of adalimumab [120]. Numerically larger decreases in mean NAPSI scores were observed over time for patients without a history of PsA compared with patients with a history of PsA; however, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Efficacy on nail psoriasis has been a secondary endpoint in the REACH study investigating adalimumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic PP of the hands and feet [119]. Target NAPSI in 28 patients with nail psoriasis had improved 50 and 54 % at weeks 16 and 28, respectively. In a post hoc analysis of the REACH study among 31 patients with nail psoriasis, a greater percentage of adalimumab-treated patients achieved NAPSI-50 (56.5 %) versus placebo (12.5 %) at week 16 [121]. A remarkable finding in this study was that NAPSI-50 responders experienced a greater mean reduction in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score (86.1 %) than NAPSI-50 non-nesponders (1.4 %) among patients treated with adalimumab.

(p65.5) Daily practice studies were published by Sola-Ortigosa et al. [122], Bardazzi et al. [123], and Kyriakou et al. [124]. Prospective and retrospective studies comparing several systemic and biologic therapies have been conducted and will be discussed in Sect. 9. The efficacy of adalimumab in these trials is in the same range as in the above-mentioned studies [79,84,125,126]. Briefly, Ozmen et al. [125] reported a reduction in NAPSI of 54 % in eight patients receiving adalimumab at 48 weeks, Saraceno et al. [126] reported a NAPSI reduction of 66 % in 20 adalimumabtreated patients, and in the eight patients reported by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was 37, 73, and 84 % at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, respectively. Finally, after 12 months of treatment, Karanikolas et al.

## (s67) Golimumab
(p67.0) Golimumab is a human monoclonal anti-TNFa antibody that has a registration for the treatment of PsA but not for PP. In an RCT in PsA patients-the GO-REVEAL studynail involvement was a secondary endpoint (Table 3) [133]. Approximately half of the patients were also taking methotrexate. In patients treated with the common dose of golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks, improvement was reported both in target NAPSI (-43 %), and PGA (-48 %) at 24 weeks. Target NAPSI improvement was even slightly higher (-52 %) at 52 weeks [134].

## (s68) Certolizumab Pegol
(p68.0) Certolizumab pegol is a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to TNFa that is chemically modified by PEGylation, resulting in a final product that has a prolonged halflife in patients. In the maintenance phase of treatment, patients receive one dose every 2-4 weeks, which is slightly less frequent than with other anti-TNFa antibodies. It is registered for PsA patients but several trials in PP patients are ongoing. The RAPID-PsA study was an RCT investigating certolizumab pegol in PsA patients in which psoriatic nail involvement was a secondary endpoint [135]. As in many studies primarily focussing on PsA, concomitant use of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or oral corticosteroids was permitted. Mean target NAPSI change from baseline at week 24 was -52 % with certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks and -59 % with certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks versus -32 % with placebo (p = 0.003 and p \ 0.001, respectively) [ Table 3]. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and pruritus.

## (s69) Anti-Interleukin (IL)-17 Treatments
(p69.0) Fundamental immunological research pointed to a central pathogenic pathway in which IL-17A is the most critical T-cell-derived cytokine in altering skin function, while, in turn, IL-17-producing T cells (T17 cells) are regulated by IL-23. There is thus an intimate link between dissection of pathogenic pathways for psoriasis and new emerging therapies for this disease [136]. Several clinical trials in PP have suggested this concept being correct (Table 3) [137][138][139], but others have criticized some of these trials [140,141]. Two IL-17 neutralizing agents (i.e. secukinumab and ixekizumab) have been investigated in nail psoriasis. Common adverse effects of anti-IL-17 treatments are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. Secukinumab may exacerbate Crohn's disease, and anaphylaxis and cases of urticaria are reported. These drugs should be used with caution in patients with chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, and all patients should be evaluated for TB before initiating.

## (s70) Secukinumab
(p70.0) Secukinumab is a human monoclonal IgG1 k antibody that targets IL-17A and has been approved for the treatment of PP and PsA. Little is known about the efficacy of secukinumab in nail psoriasis. One subanalysis of a dose-finding RCT reported secukinumab improvement of nail lesions in moderate to severe PP [139]. Unfortunately, the NAPSI scale was not used but rather a never before described composite score (range 0-20) was used, and no patients were treated using the eventually approved dose for PP. From this study, no conclusions on efficacy in nail psoriasis can be drawn; patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg at baseline and weeks 1, 2, and 4 had an improvement of 19 % in the composite fingernail score. In patients treated with 150 mg at baseline and weeks 4 and 8, this improvement was 11 % (Table 3). A multicenter RCT investigating the efficacy of subcutaneous secukinumab 150 and 300 mg at 16 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe nail psoriasis has recently been conducted but the results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. This TRANSFIGURE study also assesses safety, tolerability and long-term efficacy up to 132 weeks.

## (s71) Ixekizumab
(p71.0) Ixekizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-17A intended to treat PP. Although this drug does not yet have a registration, some data are available suggesting efficacy in nail psoriasis (Table 3) [142]. Significant reductions in NAPSI scores were observed as early as 2 weeks, and these effects were sustained through 20 weeks. At 12 weeks, NAPSI had decreased significantly (-57 %) in patients treated with ixekizumab 75 mg at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12. The same patients have also been reported in an open-label extension receiving 120 mg of ixekizumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks from week 20, however only in patients not achieving a PASI 75 [143]. In these patients, mean NAPSI had improved 78 % at week 24 of the extension (week 44 of the trial), and 79 % at week 48 of the extension (week 68 of the trial). Complete clearance of the nails was achieved in a high proportions of patients: 43 % at week 44, and 51 % at week 68. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and injection site erythema.

(p71.1) Ixekizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-17A intended to treat PP. Although this drug does not yet have a registration, some data are available suggesting efficacy in nail psoriasis (Table 3) [142]. Significant reductions in NAPSI scores were observed as early as 2 weeks, and these effects were sustained through 20 weeks. At 12 weeks, NAPSI had decreased significantly (-57 %) in patients treated with ixekizumab 75 mg at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12.

## (s72) Anti-IL-12/23 Treatments
(p72.0) Ustekinumab is the only anti-IL-12/23 treatment currently available for the treatment of PP and PsA. This antibody binds with high specificity and affinity to the shared p40 protein subunit of cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, blocking the differentiation and expansion of Th1 and Th17 populations. Briakinumab is another human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12/23 being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis. Further development for psoriasis has been discontinued, possibly because of cardiovascular adverse events [144]. Clinical efficacy of briakimumab in nail psoriasis has been shown in an RCT in which it was compared with methotrexate (Table 3) [78]. At 24 weeks, target NAPSI improved 56 % in briakinumab-treated patients, and 38 % in methotrexate-treated patients.

## (s74) Comparative Studies with Systemic Therapies
(p74.0) As discussed above, biologics and conventional systemic treatments have been shown, in numerous studies, to be potent suppressors of psoriatic nail disease. The degree of improvement of clinical signs attributed to individual treatments is very different, even between different studies of the same drug. This makes it virtually impossible to compare results of distinct studies with different drugs. The explanations for these differences are manifold. The 'NAPSI' scoring systems used are extremely heterogeneous, the primary inclusion criterion for a study can be PP, PsA, or nail psoriasis, the quality of the studies differs, and some studies use very liberal criteria to define nail psoriasis, while others included only patients with severe psoriasis. Finally, the period of follow-up is of the utmost importance in the judgment of the results because further improvement may occur up to 1 year. These reasons underline the need for studies in which several treatments are compared, without other factors interfering with the outcome. It is desirable to have comparative doubleblinded RCTs but hitherto all comparative studies are retrospective studies or open, prospective studies. Nevertheless, these studies have supplied us with relevant information about efficacy and speed of conventional systemic therapy versus biologics, and about efficacy of conventional and anti-TNFa therapy compared with other drugs in the same group. Secukinumab and ustekinumab were not included in any of these studies; therefore, the relative effectiveness of these anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-12/23 biologics remain to be seen.

(p74.1) The results of a prospective study comparing anti-TNF biologics with acitretin, methotrexate, and narrowband (NB)-UVB phototherapy draws attention to the importance of adequate follow-up [80]. The short follow-up of only 16 weeks resulted in no significant change in NAPSI for any of the conventional therapies, contrary to the six patients receiving anti-TNFa. On the other hand, this study also showed that patience is more important when using conventional therapies than using biologics. These differences in speed between biologics and conventional treatments (with the exception of cyclosporine) were also noted by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], whose retrospective study compared phototherapy and several systemic and biologic therapies: acitretin, methotrexate, cyclosporine, PUVA, NB-UVB, retinoid (RE)-PUVA, RE-NB-UVB, infliximab, efalizumab, etanercept, or adalimumab [79]. Significant reductions were identified in the mean NAPSI scores at 12, 24, and 48 weeks for all antipsoriatic agents, with the exception of NB-UVB. In the group treated with conventional systemic drugs, nail psoriasis improvement was significantly higher in patients treated with cyclosporine (p \ 0.01) than in those treated with acitretin, methotrexate, PUVA, and RE-NUVB at 12 and 24 weeks. In the biological treatment group, differences between distinct biological treatments had disappeared at 48 weeks, although the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was significantly greater with infliximab and adalimumab at 12 and 24 weeks. Cyclosporine was as effective as infliximab and adalimumab. Similar efficacy of cyclosporine and adalimumab was also concluded from a prospective comparison of adalimumab with cyclosporine in PsA patients also suffering from nail psoriasis [84]. Patients were treated with cyclosporine, adalimumab (40 mg every other week), or a combination of cyclosporine and adalimumab. After 12 months of treatment, NAPSI-50 was achieved in 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs.

(p74.2) Other comparative studies included only biologics. Two open, randomized, prospective studies investigated infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in a limited number of patients [125,126]. After 48 weeks of treatment, Ozmen et al. reported a reduction in NAPSI of 40, 57, and 54 % in patients receiving infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, respectively (not significant) [125]. Saraceno et al. studied the efficacy and differences in efficacy of the same three anti-TNFa treatments in 60 patients with moderate nail psoriasis [126]. At 24 weeks (the end of follow-up in this study), no significant differences between the three biologics could be measured, but mean NAPSI had reduced to 91 % in infliximab-treated patients, 70 % in etanercepttreated patients, and 66 % in adalimumab-treated patients. However, at week 14, efficacy was higher in the infliximab group compared with the adalimumab and etanercept groups. NAPSI-75 could be achieved in 65, 45, and 50 % of patients treated for 24 weeks with infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, respectively. The lack of major differences in efficacy on nail psoriasis can also be concluded from several daily practice and retrospective studies [122][123][124]. Sola-Ortigosa et al. measured a NAPSI improvement of 57 % in 15 patients after 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment [122], while the study of Bardazzi et al. in 16 patients receiving adalimumab showed a better NAPSI response at this time point (-89 %), and 94 % NAPSI improvement at 36 weeks follow-up [123]. The third retrospective study comparing the efficacy of anti-TNFa biologics on nail psoriasis also failed to show differences between infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in 39 patients [124]. After 48 weeks of treatment, a reduction in NAPSI of 95, 92, and 87 %, respectively, was observed. One retrospective study focusing on determining which biologic is the most effective in the treatment of nail psoriasis also included ustekinumab [123]. At 36 weeks, no significant differences were seen in the reduction of NAPSI, and the percentage of patients achieving NAPSI-75 (89 %) was also similar in all groups.
## (s75) Laser Therapy
(p75.0) Laser treatment is an emerging physical therapy option claiming an indication in increasing numbers of skin and nail disorders. In nail psoriasis, PDL (595 nm) treatments are also offered. A positive clinical effect of the laser is supposed to be caused by its effect on angiogenesis and vascularity within the psoriatic nail unit. Several case reports and clinical studies have been reported [57,[151][152][153][154][155], and the results of these reports are rather contradictory. While some authors claim effects mainly on nail bed psoriasis [155], others see more positive results on nail matrix psoriasis [57,[152][153][154], or even negative effects on nail bed psoriasis [57]. The reported NAPSI improvement by laser therapy ranges from a disappointing 2 % at 6 months [57] to a sensational 86 % at 1 month [155]. In addition, a rapid decrease in NAPSI, followed by a significant increase after the third month of treatment despite ongoing treatment, has been reported [154]. Several protocols to treat nail psoriasis with PDL have been advocated but comparisons did not show significant differences between 6-ms pulse duration, 9 J/cm 2 , 7 mm spot size, and 0.45-ms, 6 J/cm 2 , 7 mm spot size [152,154]. Combining PDL with photodynamic therapy [153] or tazarotene [57] has been studied. Additional photodynamic therapy with methylaminolevulinic acid or tazarotene did not significantly change the NAPSI results; however, a significantly higher percentage of patients had improvement in PGA and SGA scores after 6 months of treatment with topical tazarotene plus PDL than after tazarotene treatment alone.

(p75.1) The major side effect of PDL treatment is pain, which may last for 24 h. Other adverse events are petechiae and hyperpigmentation in 30 % of the nail folds, i.e. in virtually all patients. Pain, but also petechiae, is worse if a longer pulse duration is chosen. Summarizing these often conflicting results with PDL, one must conclude that a randomized study comparing PDL treatment with sham laser treatment is urgently needed to justify this painful treatment in patients with nail psoriasis.

## (s90) Assessment of Nail Psoriasis
(p90.0) The availability of sensitive, responsive, specific, and validated outcome measures is essential in drug research and comparison of trials. Unfortunately, these are still missing in nail psoriasis. Most recent studies on nail psoriasis use the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), target NAPSI, or one of its many variants as a marker of nail improvement [23]. To calculate the NAPSI, each nail is divided into four quadrants, each of which are evaluated for the presence of any manifestations of psoriasis in the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, nail plate crumbling) and nail bed (oil-drop discoloration, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, splinter hemorrhages). If any sign is present in all four quadrants, the nail is given a score of 4, through to a score of 0 if there are no signs in any quadrant. Each nail is assigned a nail matrix and a nail bed score of 0-4, which are combined to yield a total score of 0-8 for each nail. All nails may be evaluated, with the total NAPSI score being the sum of the scores, up to 80 if only fingers (10 nails) are considered, or up to 160 if toes are also included (20 nails). In clinical studies, often only the most seriously involved nail is targeted (target NAPSI) to assess the effects of drug therapy. Some studies use (target) NAPSI-50, NAPSI-75, and NAPSI-90 to indicate the percentage of patients achieving a (target) NAPSI improvement of at least 50, 75, or 90 %, respectively. Despite its current popularity in nail psoriasis studies, the NAPSI has some disadvantages. Its poor validation, the fact that the important nail psoriasis feature 'subungual hyperkeratosis' is not included and, in particular, the lack of correspondence of NAPSI scores with the clinical severity of nail psoriasis are important disadvantages of this scoring system [24]. Most of these limitations are absent in a newly developed scoring system, the N-NAIL, which has been partly validated [24]; however, this system has not been used in any published clinical studies. Older studies have used many different scoring systems, which, together with the major differences in study design, inclusion criteria, and follow-up, make it difficult to compare the results of individual trials. Furthermore, not only should clinical severity be part of a core outcome set in nail psoriasis but, ideally, it should also involve patient-assessed signs, QoL, patient satisfaction with treatment and outcome, adverse events, and probably costs. A first attempt at developing a tool for the assessment of various domains of nail psoriasis outcomes, known as Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (NAPPA), has recently been published [25].

## (s91) Management of Nail Psoriasis
(p91.0) Treating nail psoriasis is often a time-consuming challenge with an unsecure outcome. Response to treatment may appear everywhere in the spectrum, from very disappointing to excellent, but relapses are common. Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence-based treatments and consequent guidelines [15]. This does not necessarily mean that available treatments are not efficacious, but that final statistical evidence is missing. Therapeutic options include patient education, external topical treatments, intralesional steroids, systemic treatments, and non-pharmacological treatment options. Patient education should cover the avoidance of minor repetitive nail trauma, managing expectations with regard to the amount of time necessary for nail clearing, and discussing prevention and treatment of fungal infections in psoriasis nails [26]. Psoriatic nail changes can be provoked by minor traumas, such as nail biting, subungual cleaning, picking, or manicure. Patients should avoid these habits and keep the nails as short as possible to prevent trauma or lifting of the poorly attached nail plate [27]. Before the start of treatment, the clinician should discuss with the patient that any noticeable nail improvement will take a long time; many treatments will show maximal results only after 1 year. The low growth rate of the nail plate is responsible for a delay of 3-9 months before clinical improvement can be noticed in cases of effective treatment. Four to 6 months is a reasonable period of treatment before evaluating clinically relevant results. In the beginning, the improvement may be so limited that it is advisable to take photographs of the nails during each visit to convince both the patient and the physician that the treatment has positive results. Concomitant onychomycosis has a high prevalence in psoriatic nails. A meta-analysis has shown a prevalence of 18.0 % in psoriasis patients compared with a prevalence of 9.1 % in control groups [28]. This high prevalence rate should be a reason for excluding onychomycosis before starting intensive treatment for nail psoriasis. Obviously, treatment of concomitant onychomycosis will improve the outcome of all other treatments.

(p91.1) The choice of treatments depends on clinical presentation, as well as patient-related factors. Most patients have only mild nail psoriasis without signs of PsA or severe PP. These patients may profit from topical treatment, while systemic treatment is indicated in patients with severe nail psoriasis, major impact on QoL, or concomitant moderate to severe psoriatic skin lesions. Systemic therapy should also be favored if concomitant PsA is evident. The choice of treatments further depends on patient factors, including age, experienced burden of disease, accompanying diseases and therapies, individual patient preferences, and the risks of treatment.

(p91.2) This review covers treatment options for nail psoriasis and is the result of a systemic approach to the literature. The following databases were searched (to December 2015): the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, and Pubmed (from 1948). Essentially, the search strategy included psoria*, and (nail*, or toenail* or thumbnail*, or ungual, or unguel, or unguium, or pitting, or punctate, or Beau's lines, or subungual hyperkeratosis, or onycholysis) and (trial). Overall, 120 publications were identified using this search strategy. The titles and abstracts of each of these publications were evaluated and a total of 72 studies or case reports on the treatment of nail psoriasis were selected for complete reviewing. Publications without original data were discarded. In addition, the reference lists of all publications were checked, which resulted in an 69 additional publications. The number of additional publications retrieved by checking reference lists was high, and was mainly caused by the fact that nail psoriasis was often a secondary endpoint in studies on PP or PsA, and was not mentioned in the abstract.

(p91.3) Treating nail psoriasis is often a time-consuming challenge with an unsecure outcome. Response to treatment may appear everywhere in the spectrum, from very disappointing to excellent, but relapses are common. Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence-based treatments and consequent guidelines [15].

## (s93) Topical Corticosteroids
(p93.0) Topical corticosteroids have been used for many decades to suppress psoriatic inflammation in PP. Also in nail psoriasis, potent and superpotent corticosteroids are used frequently, and appear to be more effective in nail matrix psoriasis than in nail bed psoriasis. Topical corticosteroids are available in the form of ointments, creams, lotions, emulsions, and even nail lacquers, and the frequency of application frequency is usually once or twice daily. If used frequently and for a prolonged period, telangiectasia of the surrounding skin and atrophy of the skin and underlying phalanx may appear. Others prefer pulse therapy, with application on four consecutive days each week, in order to prevent these side effects. Clinical improvement may not be expected within 4-6 months of treatment, and further improvement can be seen during the first year.

(p93.1) In spite of the long history of corticosteroids in the treatment of nail psoriasis, only a few formal trials of their efficacy have been conducted. Clinical studies on topical corticosteroid monotherapy are even sparser. RCTs using betamethasone dipropionate ointment (64 mg/g) twice daily [29,30] and clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily [31] identified positive effects on subungual hyperkeratosis, salmon patches, pitting, and onycholysis after 12-20 weeks of use. One study compared betamethasone dipropionate (64 mg/g) and salicylic acid (0.03 g/g) ointment with calcipotriol ointment (50 lg/g) in the treatment of nail bed psoriasis with severe subungual hyperkeratosis [30]. After 3 months of treatment, subungual fingernail and toenail hyperkeratosis was reduced by 20-30 % in both groups (no statistical differences). Rigopoulos et al. conducted an RCT comparing tazarotene 0.1 % cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily for 12 weeks [31]. Patients showed a significant improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. Mild side effects were reported in 18.8 % of the tazarotene-treated patients, including desquamation and erythema of the nail-fold skin, periungual irritation, paronychia, and irritation of the skin of the toe or finger distanced from the nail area. Formulations with corticosteroids in a nail lacquer have been studied more often than other forms but are not yet commercially available. In particular, 8 % clobetasol-17-propionate in a nail lacquer has shown positive results in placebo-controlled, open studies [32][33][34]. Fifty-two to 90 % of patients showed improvement after therapy, which was directly related to the length of treatment. The symptoms that responded best to therapy were onycholysis and pitting (indicating an action on the nail matrix); however, improvement of salmon patches and subungual hyperkeratosis has also been reported, whereas splinter hemorrhages were most persistent. No adverse effects, such as atrophy, hypochromy, periungual telangiectasia, local pain, and hypersensitivity, were noted.

## (s95) Intralesional Corticosteroids
(p95.0) Locally injected steroids have a long history in the treatment of nail psoriasis [40]. Locally penetrating doses of steroid into a digit are administered by needle injection or highpressure jet from a tool such as the 'Port-o-jet', 'Med-Jet MBX', or others. Needle injection is the most common of these, with the temporary popularity of the Port-o-jet waning as concern developed over the potential for splash-back of blood and steroid from the breached epidermis on to the instrument and practitioner, or the development of epidermal inclusion cysts. The existing evidence suggests that intralesional injection into the nail bed and matrix are particularly effective for alleviating lesions caused by psoriasis of the nail matrix, and also has moderate effects on nail bed signs ( Table 1). Injections in the region of the nail matrix has almost no effects on nail bed signs of nail psoriasis.

(p95.1) The recommended protocols of treatment differ considerably. Initially, injections of triamcinolone acetonide (5 mg/ml) were administered monthly for 6 months in the proximal nail fold, followed by a further four injections over the next 6 months and then every 2 months for the final 6-to 12-month period [40][41][42][43]. More recent publications prefer a higher concentration of triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/ml), 0.1 ml administered in each of the four periungual sites, ensuring symmetrical delivery of the steroid to the nail matrix and nail bed, and administered less frequently, such as every 2 months [44,45]. Clinical results of this modified regimen were investigated in two studies suggesting improved efficacy on the signs of nail bed psoriasis (Table 1) [44,45].

(p95.2) Side effects after these procedures are well known: short-term paresthesia [44,45] and focal pain that may last for several months [40,45]; hematoma formation is rather common (up to 20 %) but asymptomatic [45]. Loss of the nail plate was seen in 9 % of patients in one study [45]. Occasionally, nail-fold atrophy can be encountered, and is often reversible. Chronic topical therapy can lead to complications of the 'disappearing digit' [46] with atrophy of the underlying phalanx [47]. Rupture of the extensor tendon has also been reported after local injection of steroids [48,49].

Initially, injections of triamcinolone acetonide (5 mg/ml) were administered monthly for 6 months in the proximal nail fold, followed by a further four injections over the next 6 months and then every 2 months for the final 6-to 12-month period [40][41][42][43]. More recent publications prefer a higher concentration of triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/ml), 0.1 ml administered in each of the four periungual sites, ensuring symmetrical delivery of the steroid to the nail matrix and nail bed, and administered less frequently, such as every 2 months [44,45]. Clinical results of this modified regimen were investigated in two studies suggesting improved efficacy on the signs of nail bed psoriasis (Table 1) [44,45].

(p95.11) Side effects after these procedures are well known: short-term paresthesia [44,45] and focal pain that may last for several months [40,45]; hematoma formation is rather common (up to 20 %) but asymptomatic [45]. Loss of the nail plate was seen in 9 % of patients in one study [45]. Occasionally, nail-fold atrophy can be encountered, and is often reversible. Chronic topical therapy can lead to complications of the 'disappearing digit' [46] with atrophy of the underlying phalanx [47]. Rupture of the extensor tendon has also been reported after local injection of steroids [48,49].
## (s96) Vitamin D3 Derivates: Calcipotriol, Tacalcitol, Calcitriol
(p96.0) Vitamin D analogs regulate epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as production and release of proinflammatory cytokines. Topical formulations containing vitamin D3 (calcitriol) and vitamin D analogs (calcipotriol, tacalcitol) are effective treatments for PP, both as monotherapies and in fixed combinations with corticosteroids. Vitamin D3 derivates appear to be more effective in treating nail bed signs of psoriasis than in nail matrix signs. Studies using calcitriol in the treatment of nail psoriasis are rare. One case was reported whereby the patient responded well to treatment with calcitriol ointment [50]; however, it was not completely clear whether this patient suffered from nail psoriasis. One RCT compared calcitriol ointment (3 lg/g) twice daily with betamethasone diproprionate (64 mg/g) on subungual hyperkeratosis [29]. After 20 weeks, nails treated with calcitriol had a 38 % reduction in thickness compared with a 35 % reduction seen in nails treated with betamethasone diproprionate (not significant). Tacalcitol is a chemical vitamin D analog that has been investigated as a monotherapy in one open study of 15 patients with both nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis [51]. Patients used the tacalcitol ointment (4 lg/g) every night in occlusion (with cotton gloves) for 6 months. After 3 months, the NAPSI dropped more than 50 %, and after 6 months of treatment the NAPSI was approximately 75 % lower than at baseline. Most patients presented with pain at the beginning of the study, but none reported discomfort after 6 months. Surprisingly, the greatest improvement was seen in nail matrix signs of nail psoriasis. Combining tacalcitol ointment (10 lg/g) with a nail lacquer containing 8 % clobetasol-17-propionate (twice weekly) resulted in major improvement of both nail bed and nail matrix signs [39].

(p96.1) Calcipotriol is the vitamin D analog most widely investigated in nail psoriasis, often in combination with other treatments but also as monotherapy. One case-series study evaluated the efficacy of calcipotriol ointment (50 lg/g) monotherapy twice daily without occlusion in the treatment of nail psoriasis for 5 months [52]. Calcipotriol was particularly effective in nail bed signs of subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and discoloration. In addition, fingertip tenderness and pain of an involved distal phalanx were significantly reduced. In a 12-week study comparing calcipotriol (50 lg/g) monotherapy with calcipotriol/betamethasone-dipropionate combination therapy, only oil-drop discoloration improved, without differences between the two groups [36]. The same two compounds in a single ointment resulted in a 72 % NAPSI improvement at 12 weeks in patients with extremely mild nail psoriasis [37]. Other studies of combination therapy of calcipotriol and corticosteroids are discussed in Sect. 5.2.
## (s97) Tazarotene
(p97.0) Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids that is selective for b and c isotypes of the retinoic acid receptor. It has been shown to have antiproliferative, normalizing-of-differentiation, and anti-inflammatory effects, and is approved for the treatment of psoriasis, acne, and photodamage. Several studies have been performed to estimate efficacy in nail psoriasis [31,[54][55][56][57].

(p97.1) In these studies, tazarotene 0.1 % gel, ointment, or cream was used once daily for 12-24 weeks. In one study, tazarotene was effective for onycholysis and pitting (only if applied under occlusion) at 24 weeks, but not for subungual hyperkeratosis, leukonychia, nail plate crumbling/loss, or splinter hemorrhages [54]; however, other studies saw an improvement in hyperkeratosis and oil spots [55,58]. A better response of nail bed signs than nail matrix signs was also concluded from another study [56]. An 88 % improvement in NAPSI at 6 months was reported from this study, but patients had only mild nail psoriasis at baseline (median NAPSI 15). Rigopoulos et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind study comparing tazarotene cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream, both under occlusion [31]. The results of this study showed a significant time-effect improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. The most recent study investigating tazarotene in nail psoriasis compared the efficacy of pulsed dye laser (PDL) plus topical tazarotene cream versus topical tazarotene alone [57]. After 6 months of tazarotene treatment without occlusion, no improvement in nail bed or nail matrix psoriasis could be observed. An explanation for this failure might be the fact that most patients were also receiving systemic therapy or using phototherapy. The laser results will be discussed in Sect. 10.1. From these studies, tazarotene appears to be effective for nail bed signs of psoriasis only. Use may be limited by the preferred use under occlusion and by the relatively frequently occurring side effects, such as erythema, irritation, desquamation, and paronychia.

(p97.2) Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids that is selective for b and c isotypes of the retinoic acid receptor. It has been shown to have antiproliferative, normalizing-of-differentiation, and anti-inflammatory effects, and is approved for the treatment of psoriasis, acne, and photodamage.

## (s98) Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors
(p98.0) Calcineurin is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that activates T cells by upregulation of the expression of IL-2. Increased IL-2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cell responses. Systemic inhibition of calcineurin, particularly with cyclosporine, has been shown to be an effective treatment for PP [59]. The use of systemic calcineurin inhibitors in psoriasis is limited by potential severe side effects; however, topical treatment of nail psoriasis with calcineurin inhibitors could prevent the majority of these side effects. Several case reports and studies using topical cyclosporine and tacrolimus have been published [60][61][62]. In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, nails of eight patients were treated twice daily for 12 weeks with a 70 mg/ml maize-oil-dissolved oral cyclosporine solution [61]. This study showed excellent results in the majority of patients; mean improvement was 77 % in the cyclosporine-treated group and 12 % in the placebo-treated group. Improvement was noted both in nail matrix signs of nail psoriasis (pitting) and in nail bed signs (hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, crumbling, and oil-drop discoloration). No local or systemic side effects were detectable, but nails may turn yellowish after long-term application of cyclosporine in maize oil. These positive results were rather surprising considering the known issue of difficult penetration of cyclosporine through the skin and the nail due to its highly lipophilic nature and size of the molecule [63]. Later, Prins et al. reported pharmaceutical instability of the used topical cyclosporine emulsion for nail psoriasis within 4 h after preparation [64]. According to this study, patients should homogenize the emulsion before each application in order to prevent treatment failure. An unpublished study from Rotterdam, The Netherlands, sponsored by Novartis (ISRCTN47031769) tried to confirm the positive results of cyclosporine on nail psoriasis, but the investigators were unable to find differences between the cyclosporine-treated nails and the maize-oiltreated nails (personal communication).

(p98.1) Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor with much better skin-penetrating capacities than cyclosporine. In a 12-week randomized, controlled, open-label study, the efficacy and safety of topical treatment with tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment was assessed in 21 patients with nail psoriasis [62]. Application was once daily at bedtime onto the nail folds of affected nails, without occlusion, and patients were instructed not to wash their hands until the next morning. The severity of nail psoriasis improved significantly, as measured by overall NAPSI (-57 %) and target NAPSI (-65 %). Tacrolimus ointment proved to be equally effective on nail bed and nail matrix features. One patient was withdrawn from tacrolimus application after 9 weeks because of the appearance of acute paronychia. No other side effects were recorded in the observation time.These results suggest that topical tacrolimus is one of the more effective and tolerable treatments for both nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis, but these results need confirmation from additional studies.

(p98.2) Calcineurin is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that activates T cells by upregulation of the expression of IL-2.

## (s99) Anthralin
(p99.0) Anthralin (dithranol) was first synthesized as a derivative of chrysarobin, prepared from the araroba tree in Brazil over a century ago. It is an effective treatment of skin lesions in psoriasis by inhibiting keratinocyte hyperproliferation and interfering with several relevant steps of the immune system [65]. In one uncontrolled study, 20 psoriasis patients with nail involvement were treated with topical anthralin therapy [66]. An ointment of anthralin in petrolatum was applied to the affected nail bed once daily and then washed away with water after 30 min. Therapy was started with 0.4 % anthralin, and in case of lack of improvement, the concentration was gradually increased up to 2.0 %. Within 5 months of therapy, approximately half of the patients showed good improvement of nail bed signs of onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and thickening of the nail. In addition, pitting, a nail matrix sign of nail psoriasis, had improved, which is surprising since only the nail bed had been treated. Longitudinal lines or transverse lines were unresponsive. A disturbing side effect of anthralin therapy was reversible pigmentation of the nail plate, in particular accumulating in the pits. This hyperpigmentation could be reduced, but not abolished, with 10 % triethanolamine cream applied after washing away the anthralin cream.

## (s102) Methotrexate
(p102.0) As an orally or subcutaneously administered systemic compound, methotrexate is one of the most used systemic treatments in PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis. It is cost effective and its efficacy in PP and PsA has been known for many years [59]. A wide range of potential side effects limit its use, including hepatotoxicity, ulcerative stomatitis, lymphopenia, nausea, low white blood cell count, and nausea. Studies focussing on methotrexate in nail psoriasis show efficacy, but significantly less than most biologics ( Table 2) [77][78][79][80]. One RCT comparing methotrexate and cyclosporine in nail psoriasis showed a mean NAPSI improvement of 43 % in methotrexate-treated patients and 37 % in cyclosporine-treated patients at 24 weeks (not significant) [77]. The methotrexate group showed a significant improvement in nail matrix scores only, while the cyclosporine group showed significant improvement in nail bed scores only [77]. Methotrexate efficacy to treat nail psoriasis has also been compared with briakinumab in an RCT [78]. Target NAPSI improved 38 % in methotrexatetreated patients and 56 % in briakinumab-treated patients. Patients were treated with an extremely slowly increasing dose of methotrexate for 24 weeks, which might have had a negative impact on outcome. Smaller, non-controlled studies showed NAPSI improvements in the same range [79,80].

One RCT comparing methotrexate and cyclosporine in nail psoriasis showed a mean NAPSI improvement of 43 % in methotrexate-treated patients and 37 % in cyclosporine-treated patients at 24 weeks (not significant) [77]. The methotrexate group showed a significant improvement in nail matrix scores only, while the cyclosporine group showed significant improvement in nail bed scores only [77]. Methotrexate efficacy to treat nail psoriasis has also been compared with briakinumab in an RCT [78]. Target NAPSI improved 38 % in methotrexatetreated patients and 56 % in briakinumab-treated patients. Patients were treated with an extremely slowly increasing dose of methotrexate for 24 weeks, which might have had a negative impact on outcome. Smaller, non-controlled studies showed NAPSI improvements in the same range [79,80].

(p102.3) As an orally or subcutaneously administered systemic compound, methotrexate is one of the most used systemic treatments in PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis. It is cost effective and its efficacy in PP and PsA has been known for many years [59]. A wide range of potential side effects limit its use, including hepatotoxicity, ulcerative stomatitis, lymphopenia, nausea, low white blood cell count, and nausea. Studies focussing on methotrexate in nail psoriasis show efficacy, but significantly less than most biologics ( Table 2) [77][78][79][80].

## (s103) Cyclosporine
(p103.0) The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine is a powerful immunosuppressive drug that, in dermatology, has a position in the treatment of several disorders, such as severe eczema, PP, and alopecia areata. Topical use of cyclosporine in nail psoriasis has been discussed in Sect. 5.6, but systemic use has also been the topic of several reports that, despite the lack of efficacy in PsA, show reasonable efficacy in the treatment of both nail bed and nail matrix signs of psoriasis [53,79,[81][82][83][84]. One study indicated more efficacy of cyclosporine in nail bed psoriasis than in nail matrix psoriasis [77]. The efficacy of cyclosporine in comparison with other drugs has been reported in several studies. While Gumusel et al., who used the NAPSI as a scoring system, were unable to see significant differences between cyclosporine and methotrexate, most other studies used uncommon endpoints [77]. Mahrle et al. reported on a study of cyclosporine versus an obsolete retinoid-etretinate-using an unspecified 4-point scale [82]. Nail involvement had decreased by 46 and 34 % compared with baseline after 22 weeks of treatment with cyclosporine and etretinate, respectively. A 12-month comparison of cyclosporine with an anti-TNFa biologic-adalimumab-in PsA patients also suffering from nail psoriasis showed a NAPSI-50 in 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs [84]. The finding that cyclosporine was comparable to biologics in treating nail psoriasis was also confirmed in a retrospective database study: cyclosporine was the most effective classical systemic treatment; NAPSI improved 89 % at 48 weeks of treatment [79]. Concomitant use of cyclosporine and topical calcipotriol cream three times daily may further improve treatment results [53]. While most studies use doses between 3 and 5 mg/day, one study from Japan investigated a lower dose of cyclosporine per day; the initial dose of 3 mg/kg/day was successfully reduced to 1.5 mg/kg/day in responders [83]. Cyclosporine use may be limited by the relatively high rates of side effects; the most serious adverse reactions are mostly reversible renal dysfunction and hypertension. Other side effects include fatigue, headache, paresthesia, hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia, and gastrointestinal disorders. After prolonged use, cyclosporine may play a role in the development of renal failure and several malignancies. For this reason, it is often considered as an effective treatment for severe cases of (nail) psoriasis, but only for a period of 6-12 months.

## (s104) Retinoids
(p104.0) Acitretin is a non-immunosuppressing antipsoriatic drug that can be used for years in patients who can tolerate its side effects, such as cheilitis, dry mouth, and skin exfoliation [85]. Acitretin normalizes cellular differentiation and controls inflammation. The position of acitretin in the treatment of nail psoriasis is that of a rather slow-acting compound with moderate efficacy and action, particularly on nail bed signs of psoriasis (Table 2) [79,80,82,86,87]. Two open studies and one retrospective analysis indicated that a NAPSI improvement of 40-50 % at 6-12 months may be expected [79,87]. At earlier time points, acitretin is considerably less effective [79,80]. Acitretin can also be used as an adjuvant therapy to psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB), as discussed in Sect. 10.3.

## (s105) Apremilast
(p105.0) Apremilast is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 that alters the expression of a variety of immune mediators [88]. It is USA FDA-and European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved for the treatment of adults with psoriasis and PsA. Two RCTs (ESTEEM 1 and 2) in which nail psoriasis was a secondary endpoint investigated its efficacy in nail psoriasis ( The general opinion is that it has little efficacy in nail psoriasis, but one case has been reported in which it was effective both on nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis [92]. Side effects are frequent in patients using FAEs, such as episodes of flushing, abdominal pain, and a decrease in lymphocyte count. Sulfasalazine is an aminosalicylate used as a traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of peripheral involvement in PsA. Sulfasalazine is metabolized by gut flora into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid, which act as anti-inflammatory agents. The role of sulfasalazine in cutaneous psoriatic lesions and nail psoriasis is not generally accepted. One case has been reported on the use of sulfasalazine in the treatment of psoriatic nail lesions [93]. After 3 months, nail lesions started to recede and disappeared progressively. No other cases have been reported in literature.

(p105.1) Leflunomide is another DMARD used to treat PsA. It is a de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor with immunomodulatory properties. One prospective study assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of leflunomide in patients with PsA, and also in psoriatic nail disease [94]. Unlike most studies on PP, patients in this study also received concomitant antiinflammatory/antirheumatic drugs, systemic corticosteroids, and other DMARDs, predominately methotrexate. Significant improvements were experienced in 32 % of patients with nail lesions. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea, alopecia, hypertension, and pruritus.

## (s106) Biologics
(p106.0) The introduction of biologics has led to a major step forward in the treatment of severe PP and PsA, and may have the potential to revolutionize the management of patients with disabling psoriatic nail disease. Anti-TNFa treatments were the first, very effective biologics that became available to psoriasis patients. More recently, other mechanisms of the psoriatic inflammatory reaction can be suppressed with anti-IL-17, and anti-IL-12/23 monoclonal antibodies. Consequently, the therapeutic armamentarium is expanding for patients with moderate to severe PP or PsA who are unresponsive to conventional systemic therapies or have contraindications for these therapies. Infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab are anti-TNFa treatments available both for PP and PsA patients, while golimumab and certolizumab pegol only have registration for PsA. The biologic ustekinumab, which targets IL-12/23, and the anti-IL-17 antibody secukinumab are also available for both PP and PsA. All these biologics appear to have a positive effect on nail psoriasis, without major differences in efficacy between the populations they are investigated in, i.e. PP or PsA (Table 3). In general, nail responses are slow but continue to improve, lagging behind cutaneous responses over time. While the onset of response in nail psoriasis is mostly noticeable after approximately 12 weeks, further improvement or even complete clearance can be seen through to 1 year of treatment. Nonetheless, nail, skin, and joint manifestations of psoriasis generally improved in parallel based on correlation between NAPSI, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses over time. Overall, patients with greater skin or joint responses also demonstrated better nail responses. On the other hand, the presence of nail disease was not shown to predict good response of the arthritis [95], and improvement of nail psoriasis by a biologic did not depend on the presence or absence of PsA [96].

## (s107) Inhibition of Tumor Necrosis Factor-a
(p107.0) TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in psoriasis by promoting an inflammatory infiltrate into the skin and inducing keratinocyte proliferation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis, which directly contributes to the characteristic skin and nail lesions. Anti-TNFa has shown to be a relatively safe and very effective treatment for PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis ( Table 3). The originally high cost of these treatments has limited their use in nail psoriasis, but since lower-cost biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept have been approved in the US and/or the EU they may become available to more patients with nail psoriasis. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol all appear to be effective treatments for nail psoriasis and will be discussed individually in the following sections. The most often reported adverse effects related to the use of TNFa antagonists are activation of opportune infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), demyelinating diseases, congestive heart failure, induction of the formation of autologous antibodies, and antibodies neutralizing anti-TNFa drugs [97]. The development of anti-TNFa-induced lupus or classical druginduced lupus is more rarely reported. Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.

(p107.1) TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in psoriasis by promoting an inflammatory infiltrate into the skin and inducing keratinocyte proliferation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis, which directly contributes to the characteristic skin and nail lesions. Anti-TNFa has shown to be a relatively safe and very effective treatment for PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis ( Table 3). The originally high cost of these treatments has limited their use in nail psoriasis, but since lower-cost biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept have been approved in the US and/or the EU they may become available to more patients with nail psoriasis. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol all appear to be effective treatments for nail psoriasis and will be discussed individually in the following sections. The most often reported adverse effects related to the use of TNFa antagonists are activation of opportune infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), demyelinating diseases, congestive heart failure, induction of the formation of autologous antibodies, and antibodies neutralizing anti-TNFa drugs [97]. The development of anti-TNFa-induced lupus or classical druginduced lupus is more rarely reported. Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.

## (s108) Infliximab
(p108.0) Infliximab was approved in the US in 1998 for the treatment of Crohn's disease. Thereafter, infliximab has had its indication expanded, and in 2005/2006 became available for the treatment of PsA and PP. It is a chimeric anti-TNFa immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that is comprised of human antibody constant regions and murine variable regions. Infliximab binds both soluble and membrane-bound TNFa, preventing it from binding its receptor, resulting in a decrease in epidermal T-cell infiltration. The chimeric character of infliximab may result in a higher formation of neutralizing antibodies than occurs with fully human(-ized) antibodies. A concern related to the formation of these antibodies is the decreased efficacy of infliximab over time, which may require increased infusion frequencies, higher doses to maintain a clinical response and disease control, and infusion reactions, occurring in 16 % of infliximab-treated patients [98]. These reactions can involve chills, fever, headache, flushing and urticaria, myalgia and arthralgia, nausea, dyspnoea, and hypotension [99][100][101]. Most infusion-related reactions are mild and can usually be ameliorated by reducing the rate of infusion rather than discontinuing therapy. However, anaphylactic reactions are also possible, requiring surveillance during and for 1 h after infusion. A type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction may also present 3-12 days after infusion and produce a serum sickness-like reaction [102]. A study comparing the incidence of onychomycosis inpatients      treated with infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab has shown a statistical positive association between fungal infections of the nail in psoriasis patients and the use of infliximab [103]. Thirty-three percent of patients receiving infliximab had a positive fungal culture, while in patients receiving etanercept and adalimumab, as well as controls, this percentage was 15.5, 13.3, and 13.9 %, respectively. Several studies have proven the beneficial effect of infliximab on nail psoriasis, both in PsA and PP patients, and also in patients with severe nail psoriasis at baseline (Table 3). No differences between efficacy in nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis have been reported. Patients with a high PASI response have a more rapid and profound nail response than patients with a poorer PASI response [104]. In addition, QoL improves during infliximab treatment in nail psoriasis [105].
## (s109) Adalimumab
(p109.0) PP and PsA are both indications for adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNFa IgG1 monoclonal antibody. On binding TNFa, adalimumab neutralizes the biological activities of this cytokine by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, and modulating biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNFa. Initially, its efficacy in nail psoriasis was claimed in a case report [115] but clinical studies have followed ( Table 3). The first study was an open-label study in patients with mild to moderate nail psoriasis [96]. After 24 weeks of treatment, the fingernail NAPSI had improved 85 %. No differences in efficacy were seen between patients with PP only and patients with both PP and PsA. Another open-label study investigated the efficacy of adalimumab in 259 PsA patients only [116]. At week 12, NAPSI improvement in patients naive for anti-TNFa (-33 %) was not significantly different from patients with prior treatment with infliximab and/or etanercept (-42 %). In the STEREO study, another prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study that evaluated the effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with active PsA, the median reduction in NAPSI score was 57 % in 259 patients with both active arthritis and nail psoriasis at 12 weeks [95]. NAPSI-50 was recorded in 54 % of patients with a baseline NAPSI score of at least 10. This study also searched for predictors of good clinical responses for arthritis, skin, and nail lesions. Nail disease turned out to be unable to predict good response of the arthritis.

(p109.1) The BELIEVE study and the REACH study are two randomized, double-blind, controlled studies in PP patients reporting on the efficacy of adalimumab in nail psoriasis [117][118][119][120][121]. A subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study of 457 patients also with nail psoriasis claimed a reduction in the NAPSI nail matrix component of 39 % and NAPSI nail bed component of 60 % at week 16 [117]. These results appear to contradict the overall NAPSI reduction of 40 % at week 16 because both the matrix and bed signs are equally important in the calculation of the overall NAPSI. Another subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study focussed on the influence of PsA on the efficacy of adalimumab [120]. Numerically larger decreases in mean NAPSI scores were observed over time for patients without a history of PsA compared with patients with a history of PsA; however, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Efficacy on nail psoriasis has been a secondary endpoint in the REACH study investigating adalimumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic PP of the hands and feet [119]. Target NAPSI in 28 patients with nail psoriasis had improved 50 and 54 % at weeks 16 and 28, respectively. In a post hoc analysis of the REACH study among 31 patients with nail psoriasis, a greater percentage of adalimumab-treated patients achieved NAPSI-50 (56.5 %) versus placebo (12.5 %) at week 16 [121]. A remarkable finding in this study was that NAPSI-50 responders experienced a greater mean reduction in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score (86.1 %) than NAPSI-50 non-nesponders (1.4 %) among patients treated with adalimumab.

(p109.2) Daily practice studies were published by Sola-Ortigosa et al. [122], Bardazzi et al. [123], and Kyriakou et al. [124]. Prospective and retrospective studies comparing several systemic and biologic therapies have been conducted and will be discussed in Sect. 9. The efficacy of adalimumab in these trials is in the same range as in the above-mentioned studies [79,84,125,126]. Briefly, Ozmen et al. [125] reported a reduction in NAPSI of 54 % in eight patients receiving adalimumab at 48 weeks, Saraceno et al. [126] reported a NAPSI reduction of 66 % in 20 adalimumabtreated patients, and in the eight patients reported by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was 37, 73, and 84 % at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, respectively. Finally, after 12 months of treatment, Karanikolas et al. [84] reported NAPSI-50 in 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs. Summarizing these results, it is clear that adalimumab is an effective treatment for psoriasis of the nail bed and the nail plate, both in PP patients and in PsA patients. The most commonly reported side effects of adalimumab are comparable with those of other biologics. A prospective study was unable to see an increased incidence of onychomycosis in psoriasis patients treated with adalimumab for 24 weeks [103].

In an RCT in PsA patients-the GO-REVEAL studynail involvement was a secondary endpoint (Table 3) [133]. Approximately half of the patients were also taking methotrexate. In patients treated with the common dose of golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks, improvement was reported both in target NAPSI (-43 %), and PGA (-48 %) at 24 weeks.

## (s112) Certolizumab Pegol
(p112.0) Certolizumab pegol is a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to TNFa that is chemically modified by PEGylation, resulting in a final product that has a prolonged halflife in patients. In the maintenance phase of treatment, patients receive one dose every 2-4 weeks, which is slightly less frequent than with other anti-TNFa antibodies. It is registered for PsA patients but several trials in PP patients are ongoing. The RAPID-PsA study was an RCT investigating certolizumab pegol in PsA patients in which psoriatic nail involvement was a secondary endpoint [135]. As in many studies primarily focussing on PsA, concomitant use of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or oral corticosteroids was permitted. Mean target NAPSI change from baseline at week 24 was -52 % with certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks and -59 % with certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks versus -32 % with placebo (p = 0.003 and p \ 0.001, respectively) [ Table 3]. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and pruritus.

The RAPID-PsA study was an RCT investigating certolizumab pegol in PsA patients in which psoriatic nail involvement was a secondary endpoint [135]. As in many studies primarily focussing on PsA, concomitant use of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or oral corticosteroids was permitted. Mean target NAPSI change from baseline at week 24 was -52 % with certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks and -59 % with certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks versus -32 % with placebo (p = 0.003 and p \ 0.001, respectively) [ Table 3]. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and pruritus.
## (s113) Anti-Interleukin (IL)-17 Treatments
(p113.0) Fundamental immunological research pointed to a central pathogenic pathway in which IL-17A is the most critical T-cell-derived cytokine in altering skin function, while, in turn, IL-17-producing T cells (T17 cells) are regulated by IL-23. There is thus an intimate link between dissection of pathogenic pathways for psoriasis and new emerging therapies for this disease [136]. Several clinical trials in PP have suggested this concept being correct (Table 3) [137][138][139], but others have criticized some of these trials [140,141]. Two IL-17 neutralizing agents (i.e. secukinumab and ixekizumab) have been investigated in nail psoriasis. Common adverse effects of anti-IL-17 treatments are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. Secukinumab may exacerbate Crohn's disease, and anaphylaxis and cases of urticaria are reported. These drugs should be used with caution in patients with chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, and all patients should be evaluated for TB before initiating.

## (s114) Secukinumab
(p114.0) Secukinumab is a human monoclonal IgG1 k antibody that targets IL-17A and has been approved for the treatment of PP and PsA. Little is known about the efficacy of secukinumab in nail psoriasis. One subanalysis of a dose-finding RCT reported secukinumab improvement of nail lesions in moderate to severe PP [139]. Unfortunately, the NAPSI scale was not used but rather a never before described composite score (range 0-20) was used, and no patients were treated using the eventually approved dose for PP. From this study, no conclusions on efficacy in nail psoriasis can be drawn; patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg at baseline and weeks 1, 2, and 4 had an improvement of 19 % in the composite fingernail score. In patients treated with 150 mg at baseline and weeks 4 and 8, this improvement was 11 % (Table 3). A multicenter RCT investigating the efficacy of subcutaneous secukinumab 150 and 300 mg at 16 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe nail psoriasis has recently been conducted but the results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. This TRANSFIGURE study also assesses safety, tolerability and long-term efficacy up to 132 weeks.

## (s115) Ixekizumab
(p115.0) Ixekizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-17A intended to treat PP. Although this drug does not yet have a registration, some data are available suggesting efficacy in nail psoriasis (Table 3) [142]. Significant reductions in NAPSI scores were observed as early as 2 weeks, and these effects were sustained through 20 weeks. At 12 weeks, NAPSI had decreased significantly (-57 %) in patients treated with ixekizumab 75 mg at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12. The same patients have also been reported in an open-label extension receiving 120 mg of ixekizumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks from week 20, however only in patients not achieving a PASI 75 [143]. In these patients, mean NAPSI had improved 78 % at week 24 of the extension (week 44 of the trial), and 79 % at week 48 of the extension (week 68 of the trial). Complete clearance of the nails was achieved in a high proportions of patients: 43 % at week 44, and 51 % at week 68. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and injection site erythema.

## (s116) Anti-IL-12/23 Treatments
(p116.0) Ustekinumab is the only anti-IL-12/23 treatment currently available for the treatment of PP and PsA. This antibody binds with high specificity and affinity to the shared p40 protein subunit of cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, blocking the differentiation and expansion of Th1 and Th17 populations. Briakinumab is another human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12/23 being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis. Further development for psoriasis has been discontinued, possibly because of cardiovascular adverse events [144]. Clinical efficacy of briakimumab in nail psoriasis has been shown in an RCT in which it was compared with methotrexate (Table 3) [78]. At 24 weeks, target NAPSI improved 56 % in briakinumab-treated patients, and 38 % in methotrexate-treated patients.

## (s118) Comparative Studies with Systemic Therapies
(p118.0) As discussed above, biologics and conventional systemic treatments have been shown, in numerous studies, to be potent suppressors of psoriatic nail disease. The degree of improvement of clinical signs attributed to individual treatments is very different, even between different studies of the same drug. This makes it virtually impossible to compare results of distinct studies with different drugs. The explanations for these differences are manifold. The 'NAPSI' scoring systems used are extremely heterogeneous, the primary inclusion criterion for a study can be PP, PsA, or nail psoriasis, the quality of the studies differs, and some studies use very liberal criteria to define nail psoriasis, while others included only patients with severe psoriasis. Finally, the period of follow-up is of the utmost importance in the judgment of the results because further improvement may occur up to 1 year. These reasons underline the need for studies in which several treatments are compared, without other factors interfering with the outcome. It is desirable to have comparative doubleblinded RCTs but hitherto all comparative studies are retrospective studies or open, prospective studies. Nevertheless, these studies have supplied us with relevant information about efficacy and speed of conventional systemic therapy versus biologics, and about efficacy of conventional and anti-TNFa therapy compared with other drugs in the same group. Secukinumab and ustekinumab were not included in any of these studies; therefore, the relative effectiveness of these anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-12/23 biologics remain to be seen.

(p118.1) The results of a prospective study comparing anti-TNF biologics with acitretin, methotrexate, and narrowband (NB)-UVB phototherapy draws attention to the importance of adequate follow-up [80]. The short follow-up of only 16 weeks resulted in no significant change in NAPSI for any of the conventional therapies, contrary to the six patients receiving anti-TNFa. On the other hand, this study also showed that patience is more important when using conventional therapies than using biologics. These differences in speed between biologics and conventional treatments (with the exception of cyclosporine) were also noted by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], whose retrospective study compared phototherapy and several systemic and biologic therapies: acitretin, methotrexate, cyclosporine, PUVA, NB-UVB, retinoid (RE)-PUVA, RE-NB-UVB, infliximab, efalizumab, etanercept, or adalimumab [79]. Significant reductions were identified in the mean NAPSI scores at 12, 24, and 48 weeks for all antipsoriatic agents, with the exception of NB-UVB. In the group treated with conventional systemic drugs, nail psoriasis improvement was significantly higher in patients treated with cyclosporine (p \ 0.01) than in those treated with acitretin, methotrexate, PUVA, and RE-NUVB at 12 and 24 weeks. In the biological treatment group, differences between distinct biological treatments had disappeared at 48 weeks, although the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was significantly greater with infliximab and adalimumab at 12 and 24 weeks. Cyclosporine was as effective as infliximab and adalimumab. Similar efficacy of cyclosporine and adalimumab was also concluded from a prospective comparison of adalimumab with cyclosporine in PsA patients also suffering from nail psoriasis [84]. Patients were treated with cyclosporine, adalimumab (40 mg every other week), or a combination of cyclosporine and adalimumab. After 12 months of treatment, NAPSI-50 was achieved in 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs.

(p118.2) Other comparative studies included only biologics. Two open, randomized, prospective studies investigated infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in a limited number of patients [125,126]. After 48 weeks of treatment, Ozmen et al. reported a reduction in NAPSI of 40, 57, and 54 % in patients receiving infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, respectively (not significant) [125]. Saraceno et al. studied the efficacy and differences in efficacy of the same three anti-TNFa treatments in 60 patients with moderate nail psoriasis [126]. At 24 weeks (the end of follow-up in this study), no significant differences between the three biologics could be measured, but mean NAPSI had reduced to 91 % in infliximab-treated patients, 70 % in etanercepttreated patients, and 66 % in adalimumab-treated patients. However, at week 14, efficacy was higher in the infliximab group compared with the adalimumab and etanercept groups. NAPSI-75 could be achieved in 65, 45, and 50 % of patients treated for 24 weeks with infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, respectively. The lack of major differences in efficacy on nail psoriasis can also be concluded from several daily practice and retrospective studies [122][123][124]. Sola-Ortigosa et al. measured a NAPSI improvement of 57 % in 15 patients after 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment [122], while the study of Bardazzi et al. in 16 patients receiving adalimumab showed a better NAPSI response at this time point (-89 %), and 94 % NAPSI improvement at 36 weeks follow-up [123]. The third retrospective study comparing the efficacy of anti-TNFa biologics on nail psoriasis also failed to show differences between infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in 39 patients [124]. After 48 weeks of treatment, a reduction in NAPSI of 95, 92, and 87 %, respectively, was observed. One retrospective study focusing on determining which biologic is the most effective in the treatment of nail psoriasis also included ustekinumab [123]. At 36 weeks, no significant differences were seen in the reduction of NAPSI, and the percentage of patients achieving NAPSI-75 (89 %) was also similar in all groups.
## (s119) Laser Therapy
(p119.0) Laser treatment is an emerging physical therapy option claiming an indication in increasing numbers of skin and nail disorders. In nail psoriasis, PDL (595 nm) treatments are also offered. A positive clinical effect of the laser is supposed to be caused by its effect on angiogenesis and vascularity within the psoriatic nail unit. Several case reports and clinical studies have been reported [57,[151][152][153][154][155], and the results of these reports are rather contradictory. While some authors claim effects mainly on nail bed psoriasis [155], others see more positive results on nail matrix psoriasis [57,[152][153][154], or even negative effects on nail bed psoriasis [57]. The reported NAPSI improvement by laser therapy ranges from a disappointing 2 % at 6 months [57] to a sensational 86 % at 1 month [155]. In addition, a rapid decrease in NAPSI, followed by a significant increase after the third month of treatment despite ongoing treatment, has been reported [154]. Several protocols to treat nail psoriasis with PDL have been advocated but comparisons did not show significant differences between 6-ms pulse duration, 9 J/cm 2 , 7 mm spot size, and 0.45-ms, 6 J/cm 2 , 7 mm spot size [152,154]. Combining PDL with photodynamic therapy [153] or tazarotene [57] has been studied. Additional photodynamic therapy with methylaminolevulinic acid or tazarotene did not significantly change the NAPSI results; however, a significantly higher percentage of patients had improvement in PGA and SGA scores after 6 months of treatment with topical tazarotene plus PDL than after tazarotene treatment alone.

(p119.1) The major side effect of PDL treatment is pain, which may last for 24 h. Other adverse events are petechiae and hyperpigmentation in 30 % of the nail folds, i.e. in virtually all patients. Pain, but also petechiae, is worse if a longer pulse duration is chosen. Summarizing these often conflicting results with PDL, one must conclude that a randomized study comparing PDL treatment with sham laser treatment is urgently needed to justify this painful treatment in patients with nail psoriasis.

Summarizing these often conflicting results with PDL, one must conclude that a randomized study comparing PDL treatment with sham laser treatment is urgently needed to justify this painful treatment in patients with nail psoriasis.
## (s134) Assessment of Nail Psoriasis
(p134.0) The availability of sensitive, responsive, specific, and validated outcome measures is essential in drug research and comparison of trials. Unfortunately, these are still missing in nail psoriasis. Most recent studies on nail psoriasis use the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), target NAPSI, or one of its many variants as a marker of nail improvement [23]. To calculate the NAPSI, each nail is divided into four quadrants, each of which are evaluated for the presence of any manifestations of psoriasis in the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, nail plate crumbling) and nail bed (oil-drop discoloration, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, splinter hemorrhages). If any sign is present in all four quadrants, the nail is given a score of 4, through to a score of 0 if there are no signs in any quadrant. Each nail is assigned a nail matrix and a nail bed score of 0-4, which are combined to yield a total score of 0-8 for each nail. All nails may be evaluated, with the total NAPSI score being the sum of the scores, up to 80 if only fingers (10 nails) are considered, or up to 160 if toes are also included (20 nails). In clinical studies, often only the most seriously involved nail is targeted (target NAPSI) to assess the effects of drug therapy. Some studies use (target) NAPSI-50, NAPSI-75, and NAPSI-90 to indicate the percentage of patients achieving a (target) NAPSI improvement of at least 50, 75, or 90 %, respectively. Despite its current popularity in nail psoriasis studies, the NAPSI has some disadvantages. Its poor validation, the fact that the important nail psoriasis feature 'subungual hyperkeratosis' is not included and, in particular, the lack of correspondence of NAPSI scores with the clinical severity of nail psoriasis are important disadvantages of this scoring system [24]. Most of these limitations are absent in a newly developed scoring system, the N-NAIL, which has been partly validated [24]; however, this system has not been used in any published clinical studies. Older studies have used many different scoring systems, which, together with the major differences in study design, inclusion criteria, and follow-up, make it difficult to compare the results of individual trials. Furthermore, not only should clinical severity be part of a core outcome set in nail psoriasis but, ideally, it should also involve patient-assessed signs, QoL, patient satisfaction with treatment and outcome, adverse events, and probably costs. A first attempt at developing a tool for the assessment of various domains of nail psoriasis outcomes, known as Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (NAPPA), has recently been published [25].

## (s135) Management of Nail Psoriasis
(p135.0) Treating nail psoriasis is often a time-consuming challenge with an unsecure outcome. Response to treatment may appear everywhere in the spectrum, from very disappointing to excellent, but relapses are common. Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence-based treatments and consequent guidelines [15]. This does not necessarily mean that available treatments are not efficacious, but that final statistical evidence is missing. Therapeutic options include patient education, external topical treatments, intralesional steroids, systemic treatments, and non-pharmacological treatment options. Patient education should cover the avoidance of minor repetitive nail trauma, managing expectations with regard to the amount of time necessary for nail clearing, and discussing prevention and treatment of fungal infections in psoriasis nails [26]. Psoriatic nail changes can be provoked by minor traumas, such as nail biting, subungual cleaning, picking, or manicure. Patients should avoid these habits and keep the nails as short as possible to prevent trauma or lifting of the poorly attached nail plate [27]. Before the start of treatment, the clinician should discuss with the patient that any noticeable nail improvement will take a long time; many treatments will show maximal results only after 1 year. The low growth rate of the nail plate is responsible for a delay of 3-9 months before clinical improvement can be noticed in cases of effective treatment. Four to 6 months is a reasonable period of treatment before evaluating clinically relevant results. In the beginning, the improvement may be so limited that it is advisable to take photographs of the nails during each visit to convince both the patient and the physician that the treatment has positive results. Concomitant onychomycosis has a high prevalence in psoriatic nails. A meta-analysis has shown a prevalence of 18.0 % in psoriasis patients compared with a prevalence of 9.1 % in control groups [28]. This high prevalence rate should be a reason for excluding onychomycosis before starting intensive treatment for nail psoriasis. Obviously, treatment of concomitant onychomycosis will improve the outcome of all other treatments.

(p135.1) The choice of treatments depends on clinical presentation, as well as patient-related factors. Most patients have only mild nail psoriasis without signs of PsA or severe PP. These patients may profit from topical treatment, while systemic treatment is indicated in patients with severe nail psoriasis, major impact on QoL, or concomitant moderate to severe psoriatic skin lesions. Systemic therapy should also be favored if concomitant PsA is evident. The choice of treatments further depends on patient factors, including age, experienced burden of disease, accompanying diseases and therapies, individual patient preferences, and the risks of treatment.

(p135.2) This review covers treatment options for nail psoriasis and is the result of a systemic approach to the literature. The following databases were searched (to December 2015): the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, and Pubmed (from 1948). Essentially, the search strategy included psoria*, and (nail*, or toenail* or thumbnail*, or ungual, or unguel, or unguium, or pitting, or punctate, or Beau's lines, or subungual hyperkeratosis, or onycholysis) and (trial). Overall, 120 publications were identified using this search strategy. The titles and abstracts of each of these publications were evaluated and a total of 72 studies or case reports on the treatment of nail psoriasis were selected for complete reviewing. Publications without original data were discarded. In addition, the reference lists of all publications were checked, which resulted in an 69 additional publications. The number of additional publications retrieved by checking reference lists was high, and was mainly caused by the fact that nail psoriasis was often a secondary endpoint in studies on PP or PsA, and was not mentioned in the abstract.

## (s137) Topical Corticosteroids
(p137.0) Topical corticosteroids have been used for many decades to suppress psoriatic inflammation in PP. Also in nail psoriasis, potent and superpotent corticosteroids are used frequently, and appear to be more effective in nail matrix psoriasis than in nail bed psoriasis. Topical corticosteroids are available in the form of ointments, creams, lotions, emulsions, and even nail lacquers, and the frequency of application frequency is usually once or twice daily. If used frequently and for a prolonged period, telangiectasia of the surrounding skin and atrophy of the skin and underlying phalanx may appear. Others prefer pulse therapy, with application on four consecutive days each week, in order to prevent these side effects. Clinical improvement may not be expected within 4-6 months of treatment, and further improvement can be seen during the first year.

(p137.1) In spite of the long history of corticosteroids in the treatment of nail psoriasis, only a few formal trials of their efficacy have been conducted. Clinical studies on topical corticosteroid monotherapy are even sparser. RCTs using betamethasone dipropionate ointment (64 mg/g) twice daily [29,30] and clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily [31] identified positive effects on subungual hyperkeratosis, salmon patches, pitting, and onycholysis after 12-20 weeks of use. One study compared betamethasone dipropionate (64 mg/g) and salicylic acid (0.03 g/g) ointment with calcipotriol ointment (50 lg/g) in the treatment of nail bed psoriasis with severe subungual hyperkeratosis [30]. After 3 months of treatment, subungual fingernail and toenail hyperkeratosis was reduced by 20-30 % in both groups (no statistical differences). Rigopoulos et al. conducted an RCT comparing tazarotene 0.1 % cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily for 12 weeks [31]. Patients showed a significant improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. Mild side effects were reported in 18.8 % of the tazarotene-treated patients, including desquamation and erythema of the nail-fold skin, periungual irritation, paronychia, and irritation of the skin of the toe or finger distanced from the nail area. Formulations with corticosteroids in a nail lacquer have been studied more often than other forms but are not yet commercially available. In particular, 8 % clobetasol-17-propionate in a nail lacquer has shown positive results in placebo-controlled, open studies [32][33][34]. Fifty-two to 90 % of patients showed improvement after therapy, which was directly related to the length of treatment. The symptoms that responded best to therapy were onycholysis and pitting (indicating an action on the nail matrix); however, improvement of salmon patches and subungual hyperkeratosis has also been reported, whereas splinter hemorrhages were most persistent. No adverse effects, such as atrophy, hypochromy, periungual telangiectasia, local pain, and hypersensitivity, were noted.

Also in nail psoriasis, potent and superpotent corticosteroids are used frequently, and appear to be more effective in nail matrix psoriasis than in nail bed psoriasis.

Fifty-two to 90 % of patients showed improvement after therapy, which was directly related to the length of treatment. The symptoms that responded best to therapy were onycholysis and pitting (indicating an action on the nail matrix); however, improvement of salmon patches and subungual hyperkeratosis has also been reported, whereas splinter hemorrhages were most persistent. No adverse effects, such as atrophy, hypochromy, periungual telangiectasia, local pain, and hypersensitivity, were noted.

(p137.6) Topical corticosteroids have been used for many decades to suppress psoriatic inflammation in PP. Also in nail psoriasis, potent and superpotent corticosteroids are used frequently, and appear to be more effective in nail matrix psoriasis than in nail bed psoriasis. Topical corticosteroids are available in the form of ointments, creams, lotions, emulsions, and even nail lacquers, and the frequency of application frequency is usually once or twice daily. If used frequently and for a prolonged period, telangiectasia of the surrounding skin and atrophy of the skin and underlying phalanx may appear. Others prefer pulse therapy, with application on four consecutive days each week, in order to prevent these side effects. Clinical improvement may not be expected within 4-6 months of treatment, and further improvement can be seen during the first year.

(p137.7) In spite of the long history of corticosteroids in the treatment of nail psoriasis, only a few formal trials of their efficacy have been conducted. Clinical studies on topical corticosteroid monotherapy are even sparser. RCTs using betamethasone dipropionate ointment (64 mg/g) twice daily [29,30] and clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily [31] identified positive effects on subungual hyperkeratosis, salmon patches, pitting, and onycholysis after 12-20 weeks of use. One study compared betamethasone dipropionate (64 mg/g) and salicylic acid (0.03 g/g) ointment with calcipotriol ointment (50 lg/g) in the treatment of nail bed psoriasis with severe subungual hyperkeratosis [30]. After 3 months of treatment, subungual fingernail and toenail hyperkeratosis was reduced by 20-30 % in both groups (no statistical differences). Rigopoulos et al. conducted an RCT comparing tazarotene 0.1 % cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream under occlusion once daily for 12 weeks [31]. Patients showed a significant improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. Mild side effects were reported in 18.8 % of the tazarotene-treated patients, including desquamation and erythema of the nail-fold skin, periungual irritation, paronychia, and irritation of the skin of the toe or finger distanced from the nail area. Formulations with corticosteroids in a nail lacquer have been studied more often than other forms but are not yet commercially available. In particular, 8 % clobetasol-17-propionate in a nail lacquer has shown positive results in placebo-controlled, open studies [32][33][34]. Fifty-two to 90 % of patients showed improvement after therapy, which was directly related to the length of treatment.

No adverse effects, such as atrophy, hypochromy, periungual telangiectasia, local pain, and hypersensitivity, were noted.
## (s139) Intralesional Corticosteroids
(p139.0) Locally injected steroids have a long history in the treatment of nail psoriasis [40]. Locally penetrating doses of steroid into a digit are administered by needle injection or highpressure jet from a tool such as the 'Port-o-jet', 'Med-Jet MBX', or others. Needle injection is the most common of these, with the temporary popularity of the Port-o-jet waning as concern developed over the potential for splash-back of blood and steroid from the breached epidermis on to the instrument and practitioner, or the development of epidermal inclusion cysts. The existing evidence suggests that intralesional injection into the nail bed and matrix are particularly effective for alleviating lesions caused by psoriasis of the nail matrix, and also has moderate effects on nail bed signs ( Table 1). Injections in the region of the nail matrix has almost no effects on nail bed signs of nail psoriasis.

(p139.1) The recommended protocols of treatment differ considerably. Initially, injections of triamcinolone acetonide (5 mg/ml) were administered monthly for 6 months in the proximal nail fold, followed by a further four injections over the next 6 months and then every 2 months for the final 6-to 12-month period [40][41][42][43]. More recent publications prefer a higher concentration of triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/ml), 0.1 ml administered in each of the four periungual sites, ensuring symmetrical delivery of the steroid to the nail matrix and nail bed, and administered less frequently, such as every 2 months [44,45]. Clinical results of this modified regimen were investigated in two studies suggesting improved efficacy on the signs of nail bed psoriasis (Table 1) [44,45].

(p139.2) Side effects after these procedures are well known: short-term paresthesia [44,45] and focal pain that may last for several months [40,45]; hematoma formation is rather common (up to 20 %) but asymptomatic [45]. Loss of the nail plate was seen in 9 % of patients in one study [45]. Occasionally, nail-fold atrophy can be encountered, and is often reversible. Chronic topical therapy can lead to complications of the 'disappearing digit' [46] with atrophy of the underlying phalanx [47]. Rupture of the extensor tendon has also been reported after local injection of steroids [48,49].

(p139.3) Locally injected steroids have a long history in the treatment of nail psoriasis [40].

## (s140) Vitamin D3 Derivates: Calcipotriol, Tacalcitol, Calcitriol
(p140.0) Vitamin D analogs regulate epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as production and release of proinflammatory cytokines. Topical formulations containing vitamin D3 (calcitriol) and vitamin D analogs (calcipotriol, tacalcitol) are effective treatments for PP, both as monotherapies and in fixed combinations with corticosteroids. Vitamin D3 derivates appear to be more effective in treating nail bed signs of psoriasis than in nail matrix signs. Studies using calcitriol in the treatment of nail psoriasis are rare. One case was reported whereby the patient responded well to treatment with calcitriol ointment [50]; however, it was not completely clear whether this patient suffered from nail psoriasis. One RCT compared calcitriol ointment (3 lg/g) twice daily with betamethasone diproprionate (64 mg/g) on subungual hyperkeratosis [29]. After 20 weeks, nails treated with calcitriol had a 38 % reduction in thickness compared with a 35 % reduction seen in nails treated with betamethasone diproprionate (not significant). Tacalcitol is a chemical vitamin D analog that has been investigated as a monotherapy in one open study of 15 patients with both nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis [51]. Patients used the tacalcitol ointment (4 lg/g) every night in occlusion (with cotton gloves) for 6 months. After 3 months, the NAPSI dropped more than 50 %, and after 6 months of treatment the NAPSI was approximately 75 % lower than at baseline. Most patients presented with pain at the beginning of the study, but none reported discomfort after 6 months. Surprisingly, the greatest improvement was seen in nail matrix signs of nail psoriasis. Combining tacalcitol ointment (10 lg/g) with a nail lacquer containing 8 % clobetasol-17-propionate (twice weekly) resulted in major improvement of both nail bed and nail matrix signs [39].

(p140.1) Calcipotriol is the vitamin D analog most widely investigated in nail psoriasis, often in combination with other treatments but also as monotherapy. One case-series study evaluated the efficacy of calcipotriol ointment (50 lg/g) monotherapy twice daily without occlusion in the treatment of nail psoriasis for 5 months [52]. Calcipotriol was particularly effective in nail bed signs of subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and discoloration. In addition, fingertip tenderness and pain of an involved distal phalanx were significantly reduced. In a 12-week study comparing calcipotriol (50 lg/g) monotherapy with calcipotriol/betamethasone-dipropionate combination therapy, only oil-drop discoloration improved, without differences between the two groups [36]. The same two compounds in a single ointment resulted in a 72 % NAPSI improvement at 12 weeks in patients with extremely mild nail psoriasis [37]. Other studies of combination therapy of calcipotriol and corticosteroids are discussed in Sect. 5.2.
## (s141) Tazarotene
(p141.0) Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids that is selective for b and c isotypes of the retinoic acid receptor. It has been shown to have antiproliferative, normalizing-of-differentiation, and anti-inflammatory effects, and is approved for the treatment of psoriasis, acne, and photodamage. Several studies have been performed to estimate efficacy in nail psoriasis [31,[54][55][56][57].

(p141.1) In these studies, tazarotene 0.1 % gel, ointment, or cream was used once daily for 12-24 weeks. In one study, tazarotene was effective for onycholysis and pitting (only if applied under occlusion) at 24 weeks, but not for subungual hyperkeratosis, leukonychia, nail plate crumbling/loss, or splinter hemorrhages [54]; however, other studies saw an improvement in hyperkeratosis and oil spots [55,58]. A better response of nail bed signs than nail matrix signs was also concluded from another study [56]. An 88 % improvement in NAPSI at 6 months was reported from this study, but patients had only mild nail psoriasis at baseline (median NAPSI 15). Rigopoulos et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind study comparing tazarotene cream with clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream, both under occlusion [31]. The results of this study showed a significant time-effect improvement for pitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and salmon patches with both agents, without significant differences between the two investigated agents. The most recent study investigating tazarotene in nail psoriasis compared the efficacy of pulsed dye laser (PDL) plus topical tazarotene cream versus topical tazarotene alone [57]. After 6 months of tazarotene treatment without occlusion, no improvement in nail bed or nail matrix psoriasis could be observed. An explanation for this failure might be the fact that most patients were also receiving systemic therapy or using phototherapy. The laser results will be discussed in Sect. 10.1. From these studies, tazarotene appears to be effective for nail bed signs of psoriasis only. Use may be limited by the preferred use under occlusion and by the relatively frequently occurring side effects, such as erythema, irritation, desquamation, and paronychia.

(p141.2) Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids that is selective for b and c isotypes of the retinoic acid receptor.

## (s142) Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors
(p142.0) Calcineurin is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that activates T cells by upregulation of the expression of IL-2. Increased IL-2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cell responses. Systemic inhibition of calcineurin, particularly with cyclosporine, has been shown to be an effective treatment for PP [59]. The use of systemic calcineurin inhibitors in psoriasis is limited by potential severe side effects; however, topical treatment of nail psoriasis with calcineurin inhibitors could prevent the majority of these side effects. Several case reports and studies using topical cyclosporine and tacrolimus have been published [60][61][62]. In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, nails of eight patients were treated twice daily for 12 weeks with a 70 mg/ml maize-oil-dissolved oral cyclosporine solution [61]. This study showed excellent results in the majority of patients; mean improvement was 77 % in the cyclosporine-treated group and 12 % in the placebo-treated group. Improvement was noted both in nail matrix signs of nail psoriasis (pitting) and in nail bed signs (hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, crumbling, and oil-drop discoloration). No local or systemic side effects were detectable, but nails may turn yellowish after long-term application of cyclosporine in maize oil. These positive results were rather surprising considering the known issue of difficult penetration of cyclosporine through the skin and the nail due to its highly lipophilic nature and size of the molecule [63]. Later, Prins et al. reported pharmaceutical instability of the used topical cyclosporine emulsion for nail psoriasis within 4 h after preparation [64]. According to this study, patients should homogenize the emulsion before each application in order to prevent treatment failure. An unpublished study from Rotterdam, The Netherlands, sponsored by Novartis (ISRCTN47031769) tried to confirm the positive results of cyclosporine on nail psoriasis, but the investigators were unable to find differences between the cyclosporine-treated nails and the maize-oiltreated nails (personal communication).

(p142.1) Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor with much better skin-penetrating capacities than cyclosporine. In a 12-week randomized, controlled, open-label study, the efficacy and safety of topical treatment with tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment was assessed in 21 patients with nail psoriasis [62]. Application was once daily at bedtime onto the nail folds of affected nails, without occlusion, and patients were instructed not to wash their hands until the next morning. The severity of nail psoriasis improved significantly, as measured by overall NAPSI (-57 %) and target NAPSI (-65 %). Tacrolimus ointment proved to be equally effective on nail bed and nail matrix features. One patient was withdrawn from tacrolimus application after 9 weeks because of the appearance of acute paronychia. No other side effects were recorded in the observation time.These results suggest that topical tacrolimus is one of the more effective and tolerable treatments for both nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis, but these results need confirmation from additional studies.

(p142.2) Calcineurin is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that activates T cells by upregulation of the expression of IL-2.

(p142.6) Calcineurin is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that activates T cells by upregulation of the expression of IL-2. Increased IL-2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cell responses. Systemic inhibition of calcineurin, particularly with cyclosporine, has been shown to be an effective treatment for PP [59]. The use of systemic calcineurin inhibitors in psoriasis is limited by potential severe side effects; however, topical treatment of nail psoriasis with calcineurin inhibitors could prevent the majority of these side effects. Several case reports and studies using topical cyclosporine and tacrolimus have been published [60][61][62]. In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, nails of eight patients were treated twice daily for 12 weeks with a 70 mg/ml maize-oil-dissolved oral cyclosporine solution [61]. This study showed excellent results in the majority of patients; mean improvement was 77 % in the cyclosporine-treated group and 12 % in the placebo-treated group. Improvement was noted both in nail matrix signs of nail psoriasis (pitting) and in nail bed signs (hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, crumbling, and oil-drop discoloration). No local or systemic side effects were detectable, but nails may turn yellowish after long-term application of cyclosporine in maize oil. These positive results were rather surprising considering the known issue of difficult penetration of cyclosporine through the skin and the nail due to its highly lipophilic nature and size of the molecule [63]. Later, Prins et al. reported pharmaceutical instability of the used topical cyclosporine emulsion for nail psoriasis within 4 h after preparation [64]. According to this study, patients should homogenize the emulsion before each application in order to prevent treatment failure. An unpublished study from Rotterdam, The Netherlands, sponsored by Novartis (ISRCTN47031769) tried to confirm the positive results of cyclosporine on nail psoriasis, but the investigators were unable to find differences between the cyclosporine-treated nails and the maize-oiltreated nails (personal communication).

(p142.7) Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor with much better skin-penetrating capacities than cyclosporine. In a 12-week randomized, controlled, open-label study, the efficacy and safety of topical treatment with tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment was assessed in 21 patients with nail psoriasis [62]. Application was once daily at bedtime onto the nail folds of affected nails, without occlusion, and patients were instructed not to wash their hands until the next morning. The severity of nail psoriasis improved significantly, as measured by overall NAPSI (-57 %) and target NAPSI (-65 %). Tacrolimus ointment proved to be equally effective on nail bed and nail matrix features. One patient was withdrawn from tacrolimus application after 9 weeks because of the appearance of acute paronychia. No other side effects were recorded in the observation time.These results suggest that topical tacrolimus is one of the more effective and tolerable treatments for both nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis, but these results need confirmation from additional studies.
## (s143) Anthralin
(p143.0) Anthralin (dithranol) was first synthesized as a derivative of chrysarobin, prepared from the araroba tree in Brazil over a century ago. It is an effective treatment of skin lesions in psoriasis by inhibiting keratinocyte hyperproliferation and interfering with several relevant steps of the immune system [65]. In one uncontrolled study, 20 psoriasis patients with nail involvement were treated with topical anthralin therapy [66]. An ointment of anthralin in petrolatum was applied to the affected nail bed once daily and then washed away with water after 30 min. Therapy was started with 0.4 % anthralin, and in case of lack of improvement, the concentration was gradually increased up to 2.0 %. Within 5 months of therapy, approximately half of the patients showed good improvement of nail bed signs of onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, and thickening of the nail. In addition, pitting, a nail matrix sign of nail psoriasis, had improved, which is surprising since only the nail bed had been treated. Longitudinal lines or transverse lines were unresponsive. A disturbing side effect of anthralin therapy was reversible pigmentation of the nail plate, in particular accumulating in the pits. This hyperpigmentation could be reduced, but not abolished, with 10 % triethanolamine cream applied after washing away the anthralin cream.

## (s146) Methotrexate
(p146.0) As an orally or subcutaneously administered systemic compound, methotrexate is one of the most used systemic treatments in PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis. It is cost effective and its efficacy in PP and PsA has been known for many years [59]. A wide range of potential side effects limit its use, including hepatotoxicity, ulcerative stomatitis, lymphopenia, nausea, low white blood cell count, and nausea. Studies focussing on methotrexate in nail psoriasis show efficacy, but significantly less than most biologics ( Table 2) [77][78][79][80]. One RCT comparing methotrexate and cyclosporine in nail psoriasis showed a mean NAPSI improvement of 43 % in methotrexate-treated patients and 37 % in cyclosporine-treated patients at 24 weeks (not significant) [77]. The methotrexate group showed a significant improvement in nail matrix scores only, while the cyclosporine group showed significant improvement in nail bed scores only [77]. Methotrexate efficacy to treat nail psoriasis has also been compared with briakinumab in an RCT [78]. Target NAPSI improved 38 % in methotrexatetreated patients and 56 % in briakinumab-treated patients. Patients were treated with an extremely slowly increasing dose of methotrexate for 24 weeks, which might have had a negative impact on outcome. Smaller, non-controlled studies showed NAPSI improvements in the same range [79,80].

## (s147) Cyclosporine
(p147.0) The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine is a powerful immunosuppressive drug that, in dermatology, has a position in the treatment of several disorders, such as severe eczema, PP, and alopecia areata. Topical use of cyclosporine in nail psoriasis has been discussed in Sect. 5.6, but systemic use has also been the topic of several reports that, despite the lack of efficacy in PsA, show reasonable efficacy in the treatment of both nail bed and nail matrix signs of psoriasis [53,79,[81][82][83][84]. One study indicated more efficacy of cyclosporine in nail bed psoriasis than in nail matrix psoriasis [77]. The efficacy of cyclosporine in comparison with other drugs has been reported in several studies. While Gumusel et al., who used the NAPSI as a scoring system, were unable to see significant differences between cyclosporine and methotrexate, most other studies used uncommon endpoints [77]. Mahrle et al. reported on a study of cyclosporine versus an obsolete retinoid-etretinate-using an unspecified 4-point scale [82]. Nail involvement had decreased by 46 and 34 % compared with baseline after 22 weeks of treatment with cyclosporine and etretinate, respectively. A 12-month comparison of cyclosporine with an anti-TNFa biologic-adalimumab-in PsA patients also suffering from nail psoriasis showed a NAPSI-50 in 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs [84]. The finding that cyclosporine was comparable to biologics in treating nail psoriasis was also confirmed in a retrospective database study: cyclosporine was the most effective classical systemic treatment; NAPSI improved 89 % at 48 weeks of treatment [79]. Concomitant use of cyclosporine and topical calcipotriol cream three times daily may further improve treatment results [53]. While most studies use doses between 3 and 5 mg/day, one study from Japan investigated a lower dose of cyclosporine per day; the initial dose of 3 mg/kg/day was successfully reduced to 1.5 mg/kg/day in responders [83]. Cyclosporine use may be limited by the relatively high rates of side effects; the most serious adverse reactions are mostly reversible renal dysfunction and hypertension. Other side effects include fatigue, headache, paresthesia, hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia, and gastrointestinal disorders. After prolonged use, cyclosporine may play a role in the development of renal failure and several malignancies. For this reason, it is often considered as an effective treatment for severe cases of (nail) psoriasis, but only for a period of 6-12 months.

## (s148) Retinoids
(p148.0) Acitretin is a non-immunosuppressing antipsoriatic drug that can be used for years in patients who can tolerate its side effects, such as cheilitis, dry mouth, and skin exfoliation [85]. Acitretin normalizes cellular differentiation and controls inflammation. The position of acitretin in the treatment of nail psoriasis is that of a rather slow-acting compound with moderate efficacy and action, particularly on nail bed signs of psoriasis (Table 2) [79,80,82,86,87]. Two open studies and one retrospective analysis indicated that a NAPSI improvement of 40-50 % at 6-12 months may be expected [79,87]. At earlier time points, acitretin is considerably less effective [79,80]. Acitretin can also be used as an adjuvant therapy to psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB), as discussed in Sect. 10.3.

## (s149) Apremilast
(p149.0) Apremilast is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 that alters the expression of a variety of immune mediators [88]. It is USA FDA-and European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved for the treatment of adults with psoriasis and PsA. Two RCTs (ESTEEM 1 and 2) in which nail psoriasis was a secondary endpoint investigated its efficacy in nail psoriasis ( The general opinion is that it has little efficacy in nail psoriasis, but one case has been reported in which it was effective both on nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis [92]. Side effects are frequent in patients using FAEs, such as episodes of flushing, abdominal pain, and a decrease in lymphocyte count. Sulfasalazine is an aminosalicylate used as a traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of peripheral involvement in PsA. Sulfasalazine is metabolized by gut flora into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid, which act as anti-inflammatory agents. The role of sulfasalazine in cutaneous psoriatic lesions and nail psoriasis is not generally accepted. One case has been reported on the use of sulfasalazine in the treatment of psoriatic nail lesions [93]. After 3 months, nail lesions started to recede and disappeared progressively. No other cases have been reported in literature.

(p149.1) Leflunomide is another DMARD used to treat PsA. It is a de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor with immunomodulatory properties. One prospective study assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of leflunomide in patients with PsA, and also in psoriatic nail disease [94]. Unlike most studies on PP, patients in this study also received concomitant antiinflammatory/antirheumatic drugs, systemic corticosteroids, and other DMARDs, predominately methotrexate. Significant improvements were experienced in 32 % of patients with nail lesions. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea, alopecia, hypertension, and pruritus.

(p149.5) Leflunomide is another DMARD used to treat PsA. It is a de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor with immunomodulatory properties. One prospective study assessed the clinical effectiveness and safety of leflunomide in patients with PsA, and also in psoriatic nail disease [94]. Unlike most studies on PP, patients in this study also received concomitant antiinflammatory/antirheumatic drugs, systemic corticosteroids, and other DMARDs, predominately methotrexate. Significant improvements were experienced in 32 % of patients with nail lesions. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea, alopecia, hypertension, and pruritus.

(p149.6) Apremilast is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 that alters the expression of a variety of immune mediators [88]. It is USA FDA-and European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved for the treatment of adults with psoriasis and PsA. Two RCTs (ESTEEM 1 and 2) in which nail psoriasis was a secondary endpoint investigated its efficacy in nail psoriasis ( The general opinion is that it has little efficacy in nail psoriasis, but one case has been reported in which it was effective both on nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis [92]. Side effects are frequent in patients using FAEs, such as episodes of flushing, abdominal pain, and a decrease in lymphocyte count. Sulfasalazine is an aminosalicylate used as a traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of peripheral involvement in PsA. Sulfasalazine is metabolized by gut flora into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid, which act as anti-inflammatory agents. The role of sulfasalazine in cutaneous psoriatic lesions and nail psoriasis is not generally accepted. One case has been reported on the use of sulfasalazine in the treatment of psoriatic nail lesions [93]. After 3 months, nail lesions started to recede and disappeared progressively. No other cases have been reported in literature.

## (s150) Biologics
(p150.0) The introduction of biologics has led to a major step forward in the treatment of severe PP and PsA, and may have the potential to revolutionize the management of patients with disabling psoriatic nail disease. Anti-TNFa treatments were the first, very effective biologics that became available to psoriasis patients. More recently, other mechanisms of the psoriatic inflammatory reaction can be suppressed with anti-IL-17, and anti-IL-12/23 monoclonal antibodies. Consequently, the therapeutic armamentarium is expanding for patients with moderate to severe PP or PsA who are unresponsive to conventional systemic therapies or have contraindications for these therapies. Infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab are anti-TNFa treatments available both for PP and PsA patients, while golimumab and certolizumab pegol only have registration for PsA. The biologic ustekinumab, which targets IL-12/23, and the anti-IL-17 antibody secukinumab are also available for both PP and PsA. All these biologics appear to have a positive effect on nail psoriasis, without major differences in efficacy between the populations they are investigated in, i.e. PP or PsA (Table 3). In general, nail responses are slow but continue to improve, lagging behind cutaneous responses over time. While the onset of response in nail psoriasis is mostly noticeable after approximately 12 weeks, further improvement or even complete clearance can be seen through to 1 year of treatment. Nonetheless, nail, skin, and joint manifestations of psoriasis generally improved in parallel based on correlation between NAPSI, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses over time. Overall, patients with greater skin or joint responses also demonstrated better nail responses. On the other hand, the presence of nail disease was not shown to predict good response of the arthritis [95], and improvement of nail psoriasis by a biologic did not depend on the presence or absence of PsA [96].

## (s151) Inhibition of Tumor Necrosis Factor-a
(p151.0) TNFa is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in psoriasis by promoting an inflammatory infiltrate into the skin and inducing keratinocyte proliferation and preventing keratinocyte apoptosis, which directly contributes to the characteristic skin and nail lesions. Anti-TNFa has shown to be a relatively safe and very effective treatment for PP, PsA, and nail psoriasis ( Table 3). The originally high cost of these treatments has limited their use in nail psoriasis, but since lower-cost biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept have been approved in the US and/or the EU they may become available to more patients with nail psoriasis. Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol all appear to be effective treatments for nail psoriasis and will be discussed individually in the following sections. The most often reported adverse effects related to the use of TNFa antagonists are activation of opportune infections, including mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), demyelinating diseases, congestive heart failure, induction of the formation of autologous antibodies, and antibodies neutralizing anti-TNFa drugs [97]. The development of anti-TNFa-induced lupus or classical druginduced lupus is more rarely reported. Contraindications for the use of anti-TNFa medications are related to the adverse events, i.e. chronic infection, such as active TB or other severe infections, moderate to severe heart failure, as well as pregnancy and nursing. TB should be ruled out before starting therapy. Patients with hematological changes, demyelination processes, and recent neoplasms should not be treated, or should be treated only in close collaboration with other relevant specialists.

## (s152) Infliximab
(p152.0) Infliximab was approved in the US in 1998 for the treatment of Crohn's disease. Thereafter, infliximab has had its indication expanded, and in 2005/2006 became available for the treatment of PsA and PP. It is a chimeric anti-TNFa immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that is comprised of human antibody constant regions and murine variable regions. Infliximab binds both soluble and membrane-bound TNFa, preventing it from binding its receptor, resulting in a decrease in epidermal T-cell infiltration. The chimeric character of infliximab may result in a higher formation of neutralizing antibodies than occurs with fully human(-ized) antibodies. A concern related to the formation of these antibodies is the decreased efficacy of infliximab over time, which may require increased infusion frequencies, higher doses to maintain a clinical response and disease control, and infusion reactions, occurring in 16 % of infliximab-treated patients [98]. These reactions can involve chills, fever, headache, flushing and urticaria, myalgia and arthralgia, nausea, dyspnoea, and hypotension [99][100][101]. Most infusion-related reactions are mild and can usually be ameliorated by reducing the rate of infusion rather than discontinuing therapy. However, anaphylactic reactions are also possible, requiring surveillance during and for 1 h after infusion. A type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction may also present 3-12 days after infusion and produce a serum sickness-like reaction [102]. A study comparing the incidence of onychomycosis inpatients      treated with infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab has shown a statistical positive association between fungal infections of the nail in psoriasis patients and the use of infliximab [103]. Thirty-three percent of patients receiving infliximab had a positive fungal culture, while in patients receiving etanercept and adalimumab, as well as controls, this percentage was 15.5, 13.3, and 13.9 %, respectively. Several studies have proven the beneficial effect of infliximab on nail psoriasis, both in PsA and PP patients, and also in patients with severe nail psoriasis at baseline (Table 3). No differences between efficacy in nail bed and nail matrix psoriasis have been reported. Patients with a high PASI response have a more rapid and profound nail response than patients with a poorer PASI response [104]. In addition, QoL improves during infliximab treatment in nail psoriasis [105].
## (s153) Adalimumab
(p153.0) PP and PsA are both indications for adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNFa IgG1 monoclonal antibody. On binding TNFa, adalimumab neutralizes the biological activities of this cytokine by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, and modulating biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNFa. Initially, its efficacy in nail psoriasis was claimed in a case report [115] but clinical studies have followed ( Table 3). The first study was an open-label study in patients with mild to moderate nail psoriasis [96]. After 24 weeks of treatment, the fingernail NAPSI had improved 85 %. No differences in efficacy were seen between patients with PP only and patients with both PP and PsA. Another open-label study investigated the efficacy of adalimumab in 259 PsA patients only [116]. At week 12, NAPSI improvement in patients naive for anti-TNFa (-33 %) was not significantly different from patients with prior treatment with infliximab and/or etanercept (-42 %). In the STEREO study, another prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study that evaluated the effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with active PsA, the median reduction in NAPSI score was 57 % in 259 patients with both active arthritis and nail psoriasis at 12 weeks [95]. NAPSI-50 was recorded in 54 % of patients with a baseline NAPSI score of at least 10. This study also searched for predictors of good clinical responses for arthritis, skin, and nail lesions. Nail disease turned out to be unable to predict good response of the arthritis.

(p153.1) The BELIEVE study and the REACH study are two randomized, double-blind, controlled studies in PP patients reporting on the efficacy of adalimumab in nail psoriasis [117][118][119][120][121]. A subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study of 457 patients also with nail psoriasis claimed a reduction in the NAPSI nail matrix component of 39 % and NAPSI nail bed component of 60 % at week 16 [117]. These results appear to contradict the overall NAPSI reduction of 40 % at week 16 because both the matrix and bed signs are equally important in the calculation of the overall NAPSI. Another subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study focussed on the influence of PsA on the efficacy of adalimumab [120]. Numerically larger decreases in mean NAPSI scores were observed over time for patients without a history of PsA compared with patients with a history of PsA; however, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Efficacy on nail psoriasis has been a secondary endpoint in the REACH study investigating adalimumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic PP of the hands and feet [119]. Target NAPSI in 28 patients with nail psoriasis had improved 50 and 54 % at weeks 16 and 28, respectively. In a post hoc analysis of the REACH study among 31 patients with nail psoriasis, a greater percentage of adalimumab-treated patients achieved NAPSI-50 (56.5 %) versus placebo (12.5 %) at week 16 [121]. A remarkable finding in this study was that NAPSI-50 responders experienced a greater mean reduction in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score (86.1 %) than NAPSI-50 non-nesponders (1.4 %) among patients treated with adalimumab.

(p153.2) Daily practice studies were published by Sola-Ortigosa et al. [122], Bardazzi et al. [123], and Kyriakou et al. [124]. Prospective and retrospective studies comparing several systemic and biologic therapies have been conducted and will be discussed in Sect. 9. The efficacy of adalimumab in these trials is in the same range as in the above-mentioned studies [79,84,125,126]. Briefly, Ozmen et al. [125] reported a reduction in NAPSI of 54 % in eight patients receiving adalimumab at 48 weeks, Saraceno et al. [126] reported a NAPSI reduction of 66 % in 20 adalimumabtreated patients, and in the eight patients reported by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was 37, 73, and 84 % at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, respectively. Finally, after 12 months of treatment, Karanikolas et al. [84] reported NAPSI-50 in 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs. Summarizing these results, it is clear that adalimumab is an effective treatment for psoriasis of the nail bed and the nail plate, both in PP patients and in PsA patients. The most commonly reported side effects of adalimumab are comparable with those of other biologics. A prospective study was unable to see an increased incidence of onychomycosis in psoriasis patients treated with adalimumab for 24 weeks [103].

(p153.9) PP and PsA are both indications for adalimumab, a fully human anti-TNFa IgG1 monoclonal antibody. On binding TNFa, adalimumab neutralizes the biological activities of this cytokine by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, and modulating biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNFa. Initially, its efficacy in nail psoriasis was claimed in a case report [115] but clinical studies have followed ( Table 3). The first study was an open-label study in patients with mild to moderate nail psoriasis [96]. After 24 weeks of treatment, the fingernail NAPSI had improved 85 %. No differences in efficacy were seen between patients with PP only and patients with both PP and PsA. Another open-label study investigated the efficacy of adalimumab in 259 PsA patients only [116]. At week 12, NAPSI improvement in patients naive for anti-TNFa (-33 %) was not significantly different from patients with prior treatment with infliximab and/or etanercept (-42 %). In the STEREO study, another prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study that evaluated the effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with active PsA, the median reduction in NAPSI score was 57 % in 259 patients with both active arthritis and nail psoriasis at 12 weeks [95]. NAPSI-50 was recorded in 54 % of patients with a baseline NAPSI score of at least 10. This study also searched for predictors of good clinical responses for arthritis, skin, and nail lesions. Nail disease turned out to be unable to predict good response of the arthritis.

(p153.10) The BELIEVE study and the REACH study are two randomized, double-blind, controlled studies in PP patients reporting on the efficacy of adalimumab in nail psoriasis [117][118][119][120][121]. A subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study of 457 patients also with nail psoriasis claimed a reduction in the NAPSI nail matrix component of 39 % and NAPSI nail bed component of 60 % at week 16 [117]. These results appear to contradict the overall NAPSI reduction of 40 % at week 16 because both the matrix and bed signs are equally important in the calculation of the overall NAPSI. Another subgroup analysis of the BELIEVE study focussed on the influence of PsA on the efficacy of adalimumab [120]. Numerically larger decreases in mean NAPSI scores were observed over time for patients without a history of PsA compared with patients with a history of PsA; however, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Efficacy on nail psoriasis has been a secondary endpoint in the REACH study investigating adalimumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic PP of the hands and feet [119]. Target NAPSI in 28 patients with nail psoriasis had improved 50 and 54 % at weeks 16 and 28, respectively. In a post hoc analysis of the REACH study among 31 patients with nail psoriasis, a greater percentage of adalimumab-treated patients achieved NAPSI-50 (56.5 %) versus placebo (12.5 %) at week 16 [121]. A remarkable finding in this study was that NAPSI-50 responders experienced a greater mean reduction in pain visual analog scale (VAS) score (86.1 %) than NAPSI-50 non-nesponders (1.4 %) among patients treated with adalimumab.

(p153.11) Daily practice studies were published by Sola-Ortigosa et al. [122], Bardazzi et al. [123], and Kyriakou et al. [124]. Prospective and retrospective studies comparing several systemic and biologic therapies have been conducted and will be discussed in Sect. 9. The efficacy of adalimumab in these trials is in the same range as in the above-mentioned studies [79,84,125,126]. Briefly, Ozmen et al. [125] reported a reduction in NAPSI of 54 % in eight patients receiving adalimumab at 48 weeks, Saraceno et al. [126] reported a NAPSI reduction of 66 % in 20 adalimumabtreated patients, and in the eight patients reported by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was 37, 73, and 84 % at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, respectively. Finally, after 12 months of treatment, Karanikolas et al. [84] reported NAPSI-50 in 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs. Summarizing these results, it is clear that adalimumab is an effective treatment for psoriasis of the nail bed and the nail plate, both in PP patients and in PsA patients. The most commonly reported side effects of adalimumab are comparable with those of other biologics. A prospective study was unable to see an increased incidence of onychomycosis in psoriasis patients treated with adalimumab for 24 weeks [103].

(p155.0) Golimumab is a human monoclonal anti-TNFa antibody that has a registration for the treatment of PsA but not for PP. In an RCT in PsA patients-the GO-REVEAL studynail involvement was a secondary endpoint (Table 3) [133]. Approximately half of the patients were also taking methotrexate. In patients treated with the common dose of golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks, improvement was reported both in target NAPSI (-43 %), and PGA (-48 %) at 24 weeks. Target NAPSI improvement was even slightly higher (-52 %) at 52 weeks [134].

## (s156) Certolizumab Pegol
(p156.0) Certolizumab pegol is a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody to TNFa that is chemically modified by PEGylation, resulting in a final product that has a prolonged halflife in patients. In the maintenance phase of treatment, patients receive one dose every 2-4 weeks, which is slightly less frequent than with other anti-TNFa antibodies. It is registered for PsA patients but several trials in PP patients are ongoing. The RAPID-PsA study was an RCT investigating certolizumab pegol in PsA patients in which psoriatic nail involvement was a secondary endpoint [135]. As in many studies primarily focussing on PsA, concomitant use of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or oral corticosteroids was permitted. Mean target NAPSI change from baseline at week 24 was -52 % with certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks and -59 % with certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks versus -32 % with placebo (p = 0.003 and p \ 0.001, respectively) [ Table 3]. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and pruritus.

## (s157) Anti-Interleukin (IL)-17 Treatments
(p157.0) Fundamental immunological research pointed to a central pathogenic pathway in which IL-17A is the most critical T-cell-derived cytokine in altering skin function, while, in turn, IL-17-producing T cells (T17 cells) are regulated by IL-23. There is thus an intimate link between dissection of pathogenic pathways for psoriasis and new emerging therapies for this disease [136]. Several clinical trials in PP have suggested this concept being correct (Table 3) [137][138][139], but others have criticized some of these trials [140,141]. Two IL-17 neutralizing agents (i.e. secukinumab and ixekizumab) have been investigated in nail psoriasis. Common adverse effects of anti-IL-17 treatments are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. Secukinumab may exacerbate Crohn's disease, and anaphylaxis and cases of urticaria are reported. These drugs should be used with caution in patients with chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, and all patients should be evaluated for TB before initiating.

## (s158) Secukinumab
(p158.0) Secukinumab is a human monoclonal IgG1 k antibody that targets IL-17A and has been approved for the treatment of PP and PsA. Little is known about the efficacy of secukinumab in nail psoriasis. One subanalysis of a dose-finding RCT reported secukinumab improvement of nail lesions in moderate to severe PP [139]. Unfortunately, the NAPSI scale was not used but rather a never before described composite score (range 0-20) was used, and no patients were treated using the eventually approved dose for PP. From this study, no conclusions on efficacy in nail psoriasis can be drawn; patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg at baseline and weeks 1, 2, and 4 had an improvement of 19 % in the composite fingernail score. In patients treated with 150 mg at baseline and weeks 4 and 8, this improvement was 11 % (Table 3). A multicenter RCT investigating the efficacy of subcutaneous secukinumab 150 and 300 mg at 16 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe nail psoriasis has recently been conducted but the results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. This TRANSFIGURE study also assesses safety, tolerability and long-term efficacy up to 132 weeks.

## (s159) Ixekizumab
(p159.0) Ixekizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-17A intended to treat PP. Although this drug does not yet have a registration, some data are available suggesting efficacy in nail psoriasis (Table 3) [142]. Significant reductions in NAPSI scores were observed as early as 2 weeks, and these effects were sustained through 20 weeks. At 12 weeks, NAPSI had decreased significantly (-57 %) in patients treated with ixekizumab 75 mg at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12. The same patients have also been reported in an open-label extension receiving 120 mg of ixekizumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks from week 20, however only in patients not achieving a PASI 75 [143]. In these patients, mean NAPSI had improved 78 % at week 24 of the extension (week 44 of the trial), and 79 % at week 48 of the extension (week 68 of the trial). Complete clearance of the nails was achieved in a high proportions of patients: 43 % at week 44, and 51 % at week 68. Common side effects are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and injection site erythema.

## (s160) Anti-IL-12/23 Treatments
(p160.0) Ustekinumab is the only anti-IL-12/23 treatment currently available for the treatment of PP and PsA. This antibody binds with high specificity and affinity to the shared p40 protein subunit of cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, blocking the differentiation and expansion of Th1 and Th17 populations. Briakinumab is another human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12/23 being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis. Further development for psoriasis has been discontinued, possibly because of cardiovascular adverse events [144]. Clinical efficacy of briakimumab in nail psoriasis has been shown in an RCT in which it was compared with methotrexate (Table 3) [78]. At 24 weeks, target NAPSI improved 56 % in briakinumab-treated patients, and 38 % in methotrexate-treated patients.

## (s162) Comparative Studies with Systemic Therapies
(p162.0) As discussed above, biologics and conventional systemic treatments have been shown, in numerous studies, to be potent suppressors of psoriatic nail disease. The degree of improvement of clinical signs attributed to individual treatments is very different, even between different studies of the same drug. This makes it virtually impossible to compare results of distinct studies with different drugs. The explanations for these differences are manifold. The 'NAPSI' scoring systems used are extremely heterogeneous, the primary inclusion criterion for a study can be PP, PsA, or nail psoriasis, the quality of the studies differs, and some studies use very liberal criteria to define nail psoriasis, while others included only patients with severe psoriasis. Finally, the period of follow-up is of the utmost importance in the judgment of the results because further improvement may occur up to 1 year. These reasons underline the need for studies in which several treatments are compared, without other factors interfering with the outcome. It is desirable to have comparative doubleblinded RCTs but hitherto all comparative studies are retrospective studies or open, prospective studies. Nevertheless, these studies have supplied us with relevant information about efficacy and speed of conventional systemic therapy versus biologics, and about efficacy of conventional and anti-TNFa therapy compared with other drugs in the same group. Secukinumab and ustekinumab were not included in any of these studies; therefore, the relative effectiveness of these anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-12/23 biologics remain to be seen.

(p162.1) The results of a prospective study comparing anti-TNF biologics with acitretin, methotrexate, and narrowband (NB)-UVB phototherapy draws attention to the importance of adequate follow-up [80]. The short follow-up of only 16 weeks resulted in no significant change in NAPSI for any of the conventional therapies, contrary to the six patients receiving anti-TNFa. On the other hand, this study also showed that patience is more important when using conventional therapies than using biologics. These differences in speed between biologics and conventional treatments (with the exception of cyclosporine) were also noted by Sanchez-Regana et al. [79], whose retrospective study compared phototherapy and several systemic and biologic therapies: acitretin, methotrexate, cyclosporine, PUVA, NB-UVB, retinoid (RE)-PUVA, RE-NB-UVB, infliximab, efalizumab, etanercept, or adalimumab [79]. Significant reductions were identified in the mean NAPSI scores at 12, 24, and 48 weeks for all antipsoriatic agents, with the exception of NB-UVB. In the group treated with conventional systemic drugs, nail psoriasis improvement was significantly higher in patients treated with cyclosporine (p \ 0.01) than in those treated with acitretin, methotrexate, PUVA, and RE-NUVB at 12 and 24 weeks. In the biological treatment group, differences between distinct biological treatments had disappeared at 48 weeks, although the percentage of reduction in the NAPSI score was significantly greater with infliximab and adalimumab at 12 and 24 weeks. Cyclosporine was as effective as infliximab and adalimumab. Similar efficacy of cyclosporine and adalimumab was also concluded from a prospective comparison of adalimumab with cyclosporine in PsA patients also suffering from nail psoriasis [84]. Patients were treated with cyclosporine, adalimumab (40 mg every other week), or a combination of cyclosporine and adalimumab. After 12 months of treatment, NAPSI-50 was achieved in 44 % of patients receiving cyclosporine, 56 % of patients receiving adalimumab, and 100 % of patients receiving a combination of the two drugs.

(p162.2) Other comparative studies included only biologics. Two open, randomized, prospective studies investigated infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in a limited number of patients [125,126]. After 48 weeks of treatment, Ozmen et al. reported a reduction in NAPSI of 40, 57, and 54 % in patients receiving infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, respectively (not significant) [125]. Saraceno et al. studied the efficacy and differences in efficacy of the same three anti-TNFa treatments in 60 patients with moderate nail psoriasis [126]. At 24 weeks (the end of follow-up in this study), no significant differences between the three biologics could be measured, but mean NAPSI had reduced to 91 % in infliximab-treated patients, 70 % in etanercepttreated patients, and 66 % in adalimumab-treated patients. However, at week 14, efficacy was higher in the infliximab group compared with the adalimumab and etanercept groups. NAPSI-75 could be achieved in 65, 45, and 50 % of patients treated for 24 weeks with infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, respectively. The lack of major differences in efficacy on nail psoriasis can also be concluded from several daily practice and retrospective studies [122][123][124]. Sola-Ortigosa et al. measured a NAPSI improvement of 57 % in 15 patients after 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment [122], while the study of Bardazzi et al. in 16 patients receiving adalimumab showed a better NAPSI response at this time point (-89 %), and 94 % NAPSI improvement at 36 weeks follow-up [123]. The third retrospective study comparing the efficacy of anti-TNFa biologics on nail psoriasis also failed to show differences between infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in 39 patients [124]. After 48 weeks of treatment, a reduction in NAPSI of 95, 92, and 87 %, respectively, was observed. One retrospective study focusing on determining which biologic is the most effective in the treatment of nail psoriasis also included ustekinumab [123]. At 36 weeks, no significant differences were seen in the reduction of NAPSI, and the percentage of patients achieving NAPSI-75 (89 %) was also similar in all groups.
## (s163) Laser Therapy
(p163.0) Laser treatment is an emerging physical therapy option claiming an indication in increasing numbers of skin and nail disorders. In nail psoriasis, PDL (595 nm) treatments are also offered. A positive clinical effect of the laser is supposed to be caused by its effect on angiogenesis and vascularity within the psoriatic nail unit. Several case reports and clinical studies have been reported [57,[151][152][153][154][155], and the results of these reports are rather contradictory. While some authors claim effects mainly on nail bed psoriasis [155], others see more positive results on nail matrix psoriasis [57,[152][153][154], or even negative effects on nail bed psoriasis [57]. The reported NAPSI improvement by laser therapy ranges from a disappointing 2 % at 6 months [57] to a sensational 86 % at 1 month [155]. In addition, a rapid decrease in NAPSI, followed by a significant increase after the third month of treatment despite ongoing treatment, has been reported [154]. Several protocols to treat nail psoriasis with PDL have been advocated but comparisons did not show significant differences between 6-ms pulse duration, 9 J/cm 2 , 7 mm spot size, and 0.45-ms, 6 J/cm 2 , 7 mm spot size [152,154]. Combining PDL with photodynamic therapy [153] or tazarotene [57] has been studied. Additional photodynamic therapy with methylaminolevulinic acid or tazarotene did not significantly change the NAPSI results; however, a significantly higher percentage of patients had improvement in PGA and SGA scores after 6 months of treatment with topical tazarotene plus PDL than after tazarotene treatment alone.

(p163.1) The major side effect of PDL treatment is pain, which may last for 24 h. Other adverse events are petechiae and hyperpigmentation in 30 % of the nail folds, i.e. in virtually all patients. Pain, but also petechiae, is worse if a longer pulse duration is chosen. Summarizing these often conflicting results with PDL, one must conclude that a randomized study comparing PDL treatment with sham laser treatment is urgently needed to justify this painful treatment in patients with nail psoriasis.
