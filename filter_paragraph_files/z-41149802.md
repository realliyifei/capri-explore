## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) The development of pulp necrosis subsequent to trauma or extensive caries places the immature tooth at risk of cessation of root growth in length, the thickening of root canal walls and the maturation of the apex. Consequently, the tooth becomes structurally weakened in terms of withstanding masticatory forces and becomes susceptible to cervical root fracture [1].

(p0.1) Traditional methods for the treatment of these teeth include calcium hydroxide apexification, which requires multiple visits over an extended period of time. This results in a delay of root canal obturation and placement of permanent restoration [2,3]. Although the evidence is equivocal, this prolonged exposure to calcium hydroxide may predispose the tooth to increased susceptibility of cervical root fracture [4].

(p0.2) Recent advancements in dental materials, such as the development of calcium silicate cements, have made it possible to implement a barrier technique with mineral trioxide aggregates (MTAs) in a one-step apexification procedure. This approach has resulted in a greatly shortened treatment time and favourable treatment outcome [5]. However, neither multi-appointment apexification with calcium hydroxide or one-step apexification with the MTA barrier technique allow for further root growth in length, maturation of the apex or root wall thickening. As a result, the potential to strengthen the developing tooth root is abrogated. With the introduction of regenerative endodontic procedures (REPs) in 2001, a biologically based framework was presented in which further root maturation can occur [6].
## (s1) Regenerative Endodontics
(p1.0) Regenerative endodontics is an exciting and rapidly developing field in the treatment of immature teeth with infected root canals and arrested root development. REPs have been described as a "paradigm shift" in the management of these teeth and can result in continued root lengthening, wall thickening and apical closure [7][8][9].
## (s2) Regenerative Endodontics
(p2.0) Regenerative endodontics is an exciting and rapidly developing field in the treatment of immature teeth with infected root canals and arrested root development. REPs have been described as a "paradigm shift" in the management of these teeth and can result in continued root lengthening, wall thickening and apical closure [7][8][9].
## (s3) Alkaline Materials Used in REPs
(p3.0) A recent systematic review of the clinical protocols applied in REPs identified several alkaline materials used [18]. Sodium hypochlorite was employed as an irrigant in 97% of clinical studies. Calcium hydroxide was used in 28% of cases as intracanal medicament as an intracanal barrier, and mineral trioxide aggregate was used in 85% of clinical studies employing REPs [18]. The most recent study also identified other bioactive endodontic cements used [19]. Three studies used Biodentine [20][21][22], one used calcium-enriched material (CEM; BioniqueDent, Tehran, Iran) [23], and another used either MTA (Dentsply, York, PA, USA) or EndoSequence Bioceramic putty (Brasseler, Savannah, GA, USA) [24].
## (s6) Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA)
(p6.0) Major components of MTA powder are tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, bismuth oxide, calcium sulfate dehydrate or gypsum and tricalcium aluminate. For clinical applications, MTA is mixed with saline or distilled water [38]. This aqueous mixture results in the release of calcium hydroxide and subsequent calcium silicate hydrate formation, which eventuates into a poorly crystalized and porous solid gel [39]. The precipitated calcium produces calcium hydroxide that confers alkaline properties to MTA after hydration [40]. MTA is a bioactive material, as calcium hydroxide is, and associated calcium ions allow for cell attachment and proliferation [41,42]. The high pH confers antibacterial properties [43,44]. Hard tissue-producing cells differentiate and migrate onto the MTA surface, forming a biological seal [45][46][47].
## (s7) Biodentine
(p7.0) Biodentine is a bioceramic cement in the same family of compounds as MTA. The material is composed of tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, zirconium oxide, calcium carbonate, calcium oxide and iron oxide. It is mixed with a hydrosoluble polymer and calcium chloride to decrease the setting time [38]. Biodentine is an alkaline cement with a pH range of 11.7-12.3 [60]. This material has also been shown not to be cytotoxic to pulp fibroblasts [61]. The dentine bridge formation formed by MTA and Biodentine was found to be comparable [62]. Biodentine can also be used as an intracanal barrier over the blood clot [20,63] and has been shown to stain teeth less than MTA [64][65][66]. Further studies on Biodentine effectiveness in REPs are needed prior to its recommendation for widespread use. It has been used in three studies that employed REPs [19].
## (s8) Calcium-Enriched Material (CEM)
(p8.0) CEM consists primarily of calcium oxide, sulfur trioxide, phosphorous pentoxide and silicon dioxide, which is mixed with water [67]. It is an alkaline material with a pH of 10.7 [68]. CEM has a shorter setting time than MTA and similar sealing ability and biological properties [67]. CEM has only been used in one study employing REPs [23].
