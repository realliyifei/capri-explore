## (s6) Interpretation of findings
(p6.0) Based on the findings obtained in the literature review, we describe a model for adapting to the family environment during the COVID-19 pandemic.These models are based on both qualitative and quantitative literature studies emerged from theories and research findings related to adaptation to the family environment when facing life difficulties with a variety of triggers.The detailed process of the systematic literature review is described in the PRISMA diagram (Fig. 3) [8].
## (s8) Basic theory of adaptation in the family environment
(p8.0) Ecological, sociocultural, psychosocial, and systems theories [9] are some of the foundations and grand theories of family adaptation (Table 1).The family is a microsystem with intrapersonal factors, one of which is demographic factors (age, education level, balance, life satisfaction, job satisfaction, and work-family conflict), which is a form of adaptive behavior [10,11,12] to achieve a new balance between the needs of each family member to the integrity of the needs of the family as a whole when facing a crisis [13].

(p8.1) Parenting theory explains that fluctuations in family life, increased parental control and support for adolescents, problems with externalizing and internalizing values, and moderate adaptation in adolescents are not the primary factors that predict the ability of the adolescent to adapt [14] because they are getting older.At the age of the child, the behavioral control provided by the family decreases, and parenting practices begin to change with the association of adolescents with their external environment.

(p8.2) Family life cycle theory sparks psychological and social adaptation in a woman starting when a woman marries and raises children,  and there is a close relationship between a adaptability of the woman to the family environment and her happiness when performing the roles of wife and mother [15].Wives and mothers are believed to have a complex level of adaptation, especially when they must double as career women [10].Ecological studies, state that the paradigm of adaptation to the potential, which focuses on environmental vulnerability, affects the way individuals face problems in everyday life related to human health and well-being [16].Attachment theory, which interprets relational theory with respect to the adaptability of humans to challenges of life, states that emotion regulation is also influential at the beginning of human adaptation to the environment.The process is such that when humans know their inner world, they will understand and process their emotions, and when parents provide effective responses, children will internalize adaptive abilities and develop their capacity to understand their personal needs and feelings as well as the needs and feelings of others [17].

(p8.3) The processing of emotions as a picture of expression and accurate response cues produces a pattern of communication as an adaptation style of the person.When the individual feels accepted by his/her environment, or the individual accepts his environment, he/she will feel more secure, minimally hiding his/her own emotions, so that the adaptation becomes a signal of positive interaction and can respond to reciprocal relationships as good interpersonal relationships and reduce the negative effects of barriers to adaptation.The ecological theory of human development commonly known as the family ecology theory initiated by Bronfenbrenner, conceptualizes the process of human adaptation as having the following levels: (a) at the onto system level related to parents, (b) a microsystem that is a family living space, (c) a mesosystem in the form of an external family that can help families adapt, (d) an ecosystem, namely community organizations in the health, education, and social sectors (social services), and (e) macrosystems in the development of socio-cultural attitudes towards the adaptation needs of family members who require adaptation [18].
## (s9) Family adaptation terminology
(p9.0) Recently, research on adaptation trending as COVID-19 cases have become a global epidemic.Adaptation is an interesting issue because it is an action that produces two forms: positively or negatively affecting non-market factors, such as water quality, ecosystem function, human health, social organization, and cultural practices [21].Family is a determining factor in the ability of an individual to adapt (Table 2).Previous findings mention that childhood, in which individuals are still attached to their families and behave according to the wishes and formations of their families, integrate with the adaptation of someone at a later age and predict human adaptability [22].
## (s12) Discussion and future research
(p12.0) The early months of 2020 marked the outbreak of the coronavirus, which dominated and changed the lives of everyone globally.Life changed instantly with learning from home, distancing from home, and working from home.As every rule has consequences, the new regulations passed by governments in some parts of the world created social uncertainty and fear [89].Fear is the emotion that arises when a human faces a real threat or perceives an obstacle.Some physiological symptoms, such as heart palpitations, stiff muscles, an increase in pulse rate, and other psychological symptoms in the form of a response to anger, avoidance, screaming, or even silence (Siddique, Ahmed, and Hossain, 2021).

(p12.1) No one knew when the pandemic would end; therefore, humans faced challenges in economic shocks and changes in social behavior [90].Currently, family adaptation required in a global context is a way for families to survive the COVID-19 pandemic.In the largest COVID-19-affected country globally, family adaptation significantly increases solidarity networks, strengthens relationships between family members both internally and externally, develops new technologies in family domestic work, opens communication relationships, and balances work patterns and family harmony [91] due to the increased flexibility of work during COVID-19 by working from home.

(p12.2) Adaptation to the family environment involves all family members and various emotional and physical components.Ecological and psychosocial studies state that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in the sense of social ownership in the community that changes the original human function as a social species, which always communicates with other people as a basic fulfillment in daily life, has now become separated and full of limitations.Thus, the inability of the family environment to become a place to learn to adapt to new conditions will cause individuals to have a social identity crisis (Antonini Philippe, Schiavio, and Biasutti, 2020).Limiting physical, psychological, emotional, and social distancing from the world outside the home environment would lead to negative emotional experiences.With effective communication, mutual support, and care for the physical and mental health of each other, each family member can build good adaptation.

(p12.3) The adaptation strategy is not obtained by the family from birth or is only referred to as the obligation of a husband or father to protect their family.Adaptation strategies need to be developed and is a way of overcoming problems by the family in meeting life needs, which is called a coping strategy [92].Education, income, and household perceptions have a positive effect on household adaptation (Gebru, Ichoku, and Phil-Eze, 2020).Gender also affects adaptability, where men as the head of the family are believed to have a higher adaptive capacity than women [93].

(p12.4) When humans are required to adapt to new ways of living and working, the family is the main factor in their survival and determines the extent to which individuals can adapt to COVID-19; thus, the family environment can be stated as a key factor in adapting to new habits during COVID-19.The pandemic has also changed many arrangements, such that eventually humans do not need to wait for the outbreak to end, and the adaptation in the family environment ensures that families can survive even though they have to coexist with COVID-19.With COVID-19, humans can be interpreted using the theory of social learning and planned behavior.The existence of these events considers family background the presence of social support, and the influence of the role model on dominant family behavior [94].

(p12.5) After analyzing scientific publications and extracting them as a model of adaptation to the family environment in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, although the number of academic publications found has increased significantly, especially in discussions of scientific adaptation, such as biology, medicine, and health, the phenomenon of adaptation in the family environment specifically show the form of adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic in the social science field.However, further development is required.

(p12.6) Conclusively, the increasingly rapid changes in global environmental capacity that are increasingly unpredictable during COVID-19 can be a special field that can be researched according to other scientific research fields.
