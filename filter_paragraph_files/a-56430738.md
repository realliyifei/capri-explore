## (s10) HOFSTEDE'S DIMENSIONS OF CULTURE MODEL (1980)
(p10.0) Hofstede theory (1980) was about the assessment of the differences in the cultural values measures of 72 different nations within three regions of the globe by administering questionnaires answered by 116,000 employees of big multi-national corporations, with the intention to locate those aspects of culture that may influence the behaviour of firms. In an attempt to justify this study, he was able to group the cultural values measure into four main dimensions and refers to them as power distance; individualism/collectivism; masculinity/femininity; and uncertainty avoidance. However, Hofstede and Bond (1988) added the fifth dimension called the long-term or short-term social value. Power distance is the extent to which power inequality or quality becomes acceptable or not based on the hierarchical nature of the organisation. Masculinity versus femininity -this demonstrates the degree to which responsibilities are differentiated based on gender in the society with a preference for the masculine values of contribution and physical attainment, while the femininity is viewed as modest, relationship inclined and concern for the fragile. Individualism versus collectivism -the focus here is regarding the level a person expects self-autonomy about taking up of roles as compared with ethnic, household and country-wide linings. Uncertainty avoidance -represents the degree to which organisations put in place protective devices regarding laws, procedures, and technology and reduce the volatility of risky events.

## (s11) Long versus Short-term orientation:
(p11.0) In culture with a long-term direction, the general consensus is that truth is a function of time, situation, and context with capability to adopt traditions in changing conditions, alongside a high propensity for savings and investments, prudence, and persistence in attaining results and on the other hand, a short-term orientation displays great honour for traditions, with a relatively low inclination for savings and investments and focus on attaining fast results.

(p11.1) Nonetheless, Hofstede assertion was later opposed by Baskerville (2003), when he argues that a particular nation might project many cultures. Furthermore, Earley (2006) demonstrates that real behaviour and organisational outlook might not be measurable, especially when managerial beliefs underlie the carrying out of studies on wide-scale many -nation basis. These dimensions refer to the effects that national cultural values can have on management decision-making efforts and how they can be adopted in establishing policies to meet local needs.
