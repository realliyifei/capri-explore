## (s0) BACKGROUND
(p0.0) Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and accounts for~25% of cancers and 15% of cancer deaths in women [1]. Population-based screening programmes inviting women from age 50 for mammographic screening have been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality [2].
## (s3) TEST/INTERVENTION PRINCIPLES Screening test performance characteristics
(p3.0) In the context of breast cancer risk assessment, the test is the estimation of an individual's risk of breast cancer. Several risk prediction models exist. Table 2 summarises the risk factors included in some of the most recently developed and widely used models [21,[31][32][33][34][35].  Table 2. Risk factors included in some of the most recently developed and widely used models and currently available tools to support risk calculation.

Studies assessing the performance of these models have consistently shown that model performance is maximised when the joint effects of risk factors are considered in multifactorial breast cancer risk prediction [21,36,37]. Population-based studies of multifactorial risk models that include polygenic scores in premenopausal women or those under the age of 50 have shown that the BOADICEA and Tyrer-Cuzick models have moderate-togood discrimination with AUCs or c-indices of 0.68-0.69 [38,39] and the iCARE model an AUC of 0.64. BOADICEA and iCARE are also well calibrated with a ratio of expected to observe the number of cases (E/O) of 0.97 [39] and 0.9 [36], respectively, while the Tyrer-Cuzick model shows evidence of overestimating risk amongst those in the highest-risk decile (E/O: 1.54) [39].
## (s6) Screening programme co-ordination and integration
(p6.0) One of the biggest challenges raised by healthcare professionals in a focus group study of incorporating cancer risk within primary care was finding the best time and place for risk assessment [61]. Several studies in the US have shown that risk assessment is feasible in primary care waiting rooms prior to annual health check or new patient visits [73][74][75][76]. However, until genetic testing is widespread within mainstream healthcare settings, this does not allow for genetic testing to be incorporated in the risk assessment prior to discussion with the primary care professional. In a recent interview study exploring the barriers and facilitators to implementing CanRisk in UK general practice, GPs and practice nurses cited appointments around the prescription/review of contraception and hormone replacement therapy as being potentially the most appropriate opportunities, due to standard discussion around the impact of these medications on breast cancer risk [paper in preparation: SA, FSD, Carver, Yue, Cunningham, Ficorella, MT, DFE, ACA, JE, JUS, FMW. Exploring the barriers and facilitators of implementing CanRisk in primary care: a qualitative thematic framework analysis]. Some suggested that a risk assessment could also be conducted or mentioned during cervical cancer screening appointments, but there were concerns about adding additional stress and/or anxiety to these already challenging healthcare appointments. There is also evidence that women prefer information by email or online rather than during GP consultations [47]. Research evaluating different implementation strategies and the impact on primary care and uptake is needed.
## (s7) Screening programme acceptability and ethics
(p7.0) A recent systematic review showed that primary care providers are likely to accept an increased role in breast cancer risk assessment as they already collect family history information regularly and readily perceive it as their responsibility [63]. However, if the risk assessment were to be conducted within a consultation there are concerns about how that may change the dynamic of the consultation [45] and about the depth and intrusive nature of some of the questions required for risk assessment, particularly around pregnancy and baby loss. Other concerns include the ethical justification of discussing breast cancer risk if little can be done by the woman to reduce her risk [57,77], as well as concerns about the accuracy of risk estimates derived from models, particularly when information about risk factors is incomplete [45,76]. The provision of training targeted at increasing knowledge about risk management strategies and risk calculation would address these concerns.

(p7.1) Healthcare professionals have also identified a number of ethical implications that would need to be considered in any future programme [66]. These include potential issues around autonomy, distributive justice, privacy, stigma, storage and access to genetic material and information, discrimination from employers and healthcare systems or insurers and the potential to increase inequalities as a result of the differential performance of polygenic risk scores in non-European ancestries described above.

(p7.2) Breast cancer risk assessment itself has been shown to be widely acceptable to the public [78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85]. Women are optimistic about receiving individualised breast cancer risk estimates, with studies reporting that 85% women consider risk assessment to be a good idea [86] and most are comfortable providing the information for the risk assessment, whether personal information, a blood sample, or a mammogram [79,80]. Importantly, no women found to be high risk in one study regretted finding out their risk [87] and all appear to understand the principles/purpose of risk stratification [84]. The acceptability of the risk assessment taking place within primary care is limited to two studies in the US [75,88]. These studies suggest that risk assessment, without genetic risk factors, is both acceptable and feasible to the public in the primary care context. The potential acceptability of incorporating polygenic risk scores has been demonstrated in a recent study reporting 84% uptake of a primary care-based polygenic risk assessment for colorectal cancer [89]. Additionally, evidence suggests that a risk assessment endorsed and performed by a familiar individual or institution, such as general practice, may be more acceptable to women and that uptake may be improved by easier access [83].

(p7.3) As the main benefit from risk assessment arises through those women who are identified as being at moderate or high risk being offered, and subsequently taking up, earlier screening/surveillance and/or risk-reducing medication, the acceptability of these management options is key. Numerous studies have demonstrated widespread reticence by primary care practitioners to discuss and prescribe risk-reducing medication for women at high risk of breast cancer [63,[90][91][92]. Lack of familiarity with and knowledge of preventive therapy has been identified as a contributing factor [91]. In addition, primary care providers do not perceive the initiation of risk-reducing medication as their responsibility [90]. However, general practitioners have reported greater willingness to continue a prescription if it has been started in secondary care [92]. This suggests that primary care would be more accepting of involvement in prescribing risk-reducing medication if shared-care agreements were in place.
## (s8) Screening programme benefits and harms
(p8.0) The main rationale for breast cancer risk assessment is the offer of enhanced screening/surveillance and/or risk-reducing medications for women who are at increased risk but currently unaware of this. As described above, increased screening/surveillance or uptake of cancer-preventing drugs in this group would be expected to lead to reductions in cancer incidence, cancer-related morbidity and mortality. No studies, however, have been conducted in primary care to assess the impact of risk assessment on these "downstream" benefits [103] or the potential harms of over-diagnosis and overtreatment. To detect such effects would require a very large trial or observational study, in line with the generally small effects that population-based cancer screening has on these outcomes [2].

(p8.1) In addition to these "downstream" benefits, the risk assessment process itself potentially also has more "upstream" benefits and harms. These include the impact on future uptake of national screening, change in health-related behaviours and psychological outcomes. Quantifying these more "upstream" effects is important as any potential reduction in cancer incidence for a small proportion of the population needs to be balanced against the potential for possible net harms among the majority who will be at near-population risk, particularly if uptake of risk-reducing interventions is low amongst those at moderate or high risk.

(p8.2) No studies have been conducted in primary care to assess the impact of breast cancer risk assessment on these more "upstream" effects. The best available evidence comes from national screening programmes. In this setting, women in receipt of risk estimates are no less likely to attend future rounds of screening [104], while women who are told they are at high risk are considerably more likely to attend future rounds of screening [105]. This is in line with the intended purpose of identifying women at higher risk, and provides direct evidence that these intended benefits are likely to be accrued. There is also some evidence that women in receipt of estimates of higher breast cancer risk are more willing to take up, and persist with, interventions to promote healthier behaviours [106]. However, there is now good direct evidence that the provision of breast cancer risk estimates does not have a major impact on health-related behaviours such as increased physical activity or healthier eating at a population level [107]. These findings are in line with systematic reviews of the wider literature, which suggest limited population-level effects of personalised risk information [108] or personalised information derived from genetic sources [109].

(p8.3) With respect to psychological outcomes, although there are no data from primary care or in the age group targeted for proactive risk assessment in primary care, there are now considerable data on the effects of providing estimates of breast cancer risk to women aged 47-73 recruited via the NHS Breast Screening Programme. These data indicate that women who were told they were at higher risk were more worried about cancer, but there was no evidence of an overall effect on worry or adverse effects on anxiety [107]. Similarly, there was no evidence of low-risk estimates producing false reassurance [107], in line with systematic review evidence that concerns about false reassurance following screening test results is unfounded [110]. There is a need to show no such adverse effects when setting up a new programme with younger women. The impact of being identified as at higher risk has potentially greater implications for younger women when considering, for example, plans for a family. It is also important to note that there is a complete absence of evidence on the impact of providing risk estimates on some other outcomes, such as informed decision-making [111]. This is especially important as promoting informed decision-making surrounding screening decisions is an explicit aim of most screening programmes.

(p8.4) Economic evaluation of the screening programme A number of analyses have assessed the cost-effectiveness of earlier mammography breast cancer screening in high-risk groups. These have shown that biennial screening from age 40 onwards in women at increased risk of breast cancer is cost-effective [112] and results in a similar ratio of false-positive findings and life-years gained as biennial screening in average-risk women between age 50 and 74 [113], and having a lower starting age for women at higher risk would increase screening benefit and reduce overdiagnosis, but at a relatively higher increase in false-positive findings [114,115].

(p8.5) No full cost-effectiveness analysis has been conducted on riskreducing medication in pre-menopausal women. A costconsequences analysis performed by the NICE guideline development panel estimated that offering risk-reducing medication in accordance with the recommendations would be cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY if there was a gain of at least 1.71 QALYs per 1000 eligible women. In women over 50, it is estimated that 11 cases of breast cancer could be avoided per 1000 women who are offered risk-reducing medication and so the panel were confident that the costs of preventing a case of breast cancer were likely to be considered acceptable from an NHS perspective. The costs in women under 50 are not known.
