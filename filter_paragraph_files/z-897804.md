## (s7) Indicators of demographic and socio-economic status
(p7.0) Age and gender but also socio-economic variables are important determinants of healthcare utilization [18,19]; hence, useful for registry and analyses purposes. The registries in all 11 countries had at least age and gender information (table 3) whereas Denmark, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden had additional registry-based information on socio-economic variables. For Italy, socio-economic information (education) was only available in some regions.
