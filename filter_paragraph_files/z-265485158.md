## (s1) Plant Hormones Play Significant Roles in Stress Alleviation
(p1.0) Phytohormones, also known as plant hormones, are intrinsic chemical compounds that govern various physiological and biochemical plant processes when present in minimal concentrations.There are nine different classes of phytohormones reported [20][21][22].According to their structural and chemical diversity, they are classified into auxin, cytokinins (CKs), ethylene, gibberellins (GAs), abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), brassinosteroids (BRs), strigolactones (SLs), and jasmonic acid [23].Phytohormones play a very crucial role in regulating normal plant growth and maintaining the homeostasis of plant cells against abiotic stress.They are bio-stimulators and signaling molecules that induce the exocytosis process of cells under adverse conditions [24].In addition to increasing plants' resistance against abiotic stresses, like salinity and drought, phytohormones also perform vital regulatory roles against hazardous compounds [25,26].Phytohormones protect plants against cellular-oxidative stress by increasing photosynthesis, and total chlorophyll content, as well as plant development and growth while reducing the production of reactive oxygen species [27].Ionic toxicity is a direct consequence arising from the excessive accumulation of Na + in plants subjected to saline conditions.The physiological integrity of plant cells relies on the particular maintenance of intracellular ionic equilibrium, a balance that can be disrupted by such conditions [28].To uphold ionic homeostasis, jasmonic Acids (JAs) play a pivotal role.Notably, the introduction of JA to maize seedlings experiencing Na 2 CO 3 -induced stress has been observed to mitigate Na + /K + ratios in both roots and leaves.This mitigation, in turn, alleviates ionic toxicity and reduces the harmful effects associated with alkaline stress [29].Exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) emerges as a crucial factor in preserving ion homeostasis in seedlings treated with NaCl, evidenced by its capacity to reduce Na+ accumulation and modulate the distribution of K + between roots and shoots.This modulation results in a substantial decrease in the shoot Na + /K + ratio.The accumulation of K + in the shoots of salt-stressed plants enables them to sustain vital processes such as photosynthesis, metabolism, and osmotic pressure, concurrently mitigating ion toxicity [30].These hormones induce different responses according to their mode of action.Here in this review, we discuss the recent advances in biosynthesis and signaling pathways of JA and their role in mitigating abiotic and biotic stresses in detail.
## (s3) Biosynthesis of Jasmonic Acid
(p3.0) Jasmonic acid is an essential hormone that is found in plant cells.It is involved in the responding capability of plant cells against stress [18,49,52].For the first time, JA was obtained from the Jasminum grandiflorum in the form of methyl ester JA.JA is categorized as a cyclopentane fatty acid.It is produced from α-linolenic acid, an important part of different membranes of plant cells (Figure 1) [53][54][55].
## (s4) Biosynthesis of Jasmonic Acid
(p4.0) Jasmonic acid is an essential hormone that is found in plant cells.It is involved in the responding capability of plant cells against stress [18,49,52].For the first time, JA was obtained from the Jasminum grandiflorum in the form of methyl ester JA.JA is categorized as a cyclopentane fatty acid.It is produced from α-linolenic acid, an important part of different membranes of plant cells (Figure 1) [53][54][55].Moreover, jasmonic acid (JA) is synthesized within cellular compartments through enzymatic catalysis mediated by enzymes such as lipoxygenase and allene oxide cyclase, which govern the regulation of octadecanoid metabolic pathways.The process of signaling and releasing JA takes place in the plastids where α-linolenic acid is oxygenized into 13S-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid by the catalysis of LOX, then 13-HPOT is converted into the form of cis-(+)-12-oxophytodienoic acid by the activity of AOC and AOS.Then, OPDA is translocated to peroxisomes where OPDA is completely reduced by OPR (Figure 1).Subsequently, it is reduced to a form of (+)-7-iso-JA in three cycles of β-oxidation.Then, (+)-7-iso-JA is shifted towards the cytoplasm where, with the catalysis of jasmonate-amido synthetase and jasmonate methyl transferase, it is converted into JA-isoleucine or methyl jasmonate [22,53,56].

(p4.1) The plants that are highly or slightly exposed to abiotic stress enhance the rate of production and release of JA by switching on the genes of JA.This shows that JA is a very important hormone against abiotic stress.

(p4.2) In conclusion, this study offers a foundation for understanding the biosynthesis and regulatory role of JA in plant cells.However, further research is needed to address the mentioned deficiencies, including investigating the sources of JA in different plant species, elucidating the regulation of JA production, and exploring its specific biological functions in response to abiotic stress and biotic.
## (s15) Arabidopsis thaliana ORA59
(p15.0) This gene has a strong role against biotic stresses [73] In the dynamic and constantly changing natural environment, plants may experience a multitude of biotic factors, including a wide array of pathogens, encompassing biotrophic, hemi-biotrophic, and necrotrophic pathogenic organisms, which are detrimental to the optimal development of plants [74].Plant resistance responses to these stresses, especially to insects, are controlled by molecular signals, among which the most significant signaling molecule is JA.Certainly, lipid-derived jasmonates (JAs) play a pivotal role in various aspects of plant development and serve as integral components in the plant's defense mechanisms against diverse pathogens, specifically necrotrophic fungal pathogens such as Alternaria brassicicola, Botrytis cinerea, Plectosphaerella cucumerina, and Pythium spp.These pathogens pose substantial threats to plant viability and growth [75,76].Pathogen attack stimulates the biosynthesis of jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), which subsequently engages with the COI1-JAZ receptor, instigating the degradation of JAZ repressor proteins and the commencement of transcriptional processes associated with the activation of plant defense mechanisms (Figure 3).Interestingly, certain highly virulent pathogens have evolved distinct strategies to inhibit the JA signaling pathway and facilitate their utilization of plants as host organisms [75,77].The JA signaling pathway comprises two distinct phases: repression, which occurs under normal physiological conditions, and activation, which is triggered in response to stress conditions.During normal conditions, the cytoplasm typically maintains a low
## (s16) Role of Jasmonic Acid under Abiotic Stresses in Plants
(p16.0) The specific roles of JA under abiotic stresses of plants have been investigated broadly.JA has the capacity to enhance the tolerance of plants against a wide spectrum of abiotic stress factors, including, but not limited to, drought, salinity, high temperature, cold, and stress induced by heavy metals [74].JA and its derivatives play a crucial role in a plant's defense against both biotic and abiotic stresses.The functions performed by JAs in protection growth and mobilizing plant defense responses constitute a direct path for stress reduction.In response to abiotic stressors, JAs primarily enhance tolerance by activating the plant defense mechanisms, mostly characterized by the induction of antioxidant enzymes and other protective compounds (Figure 4) [78].The use of jasmonates as a foliar application could help improve the plants' capability to mitigate the effects of abiotic stresses in different plants.There is an enhanced negative impact of heavy metals when they are contaminated in the growth medium of soil for plants [12].The plant showed decreased physiological growth which leads to stunned height and fruit falling at an early stage [83].For example, applying the chromium (150 and 300 µM) in Choy sum (Brassica parachinensis) caused a deep reduction in the root and shoot length, biomass, and plant growth.It also showed leaf necrosis and death of plant cells.Moreover, it also altered the composition of the antioxidant enzymes like DHAR, HAR, GST, SOD, APX, and many others [51,83,84].In this experiment, when we applied the JA at the foliar site's quantity of 5, 10, and 15 µM, it promptly detoxified and neutralized the harmful effects of chromium (specifically at the highest doses).The recovery was noted as an improvement in photosynthetic pigments, gaseous exchange increase, and reduction in adsorption of chromium and stabilized minerals homeostasis as well [23,85].
## (s21) The Role of Jasmonic Acid under Heat Stress Conditions
(p21.0) High temperature (HT) is the eminent dilemma of the modern era because of the intense climatic variations that cause massive losses in the production of crop yield and ultimately endanger food security.The yield loss due to heat stress may thrust living beings to nutritional deficiencies [8,95].Recently, a research study conducted in African tropical and subtropical zones on maize crops revealed a yield loss of approximately 1-2%, respectively, when a single-degree elevation in temperature occurred beyond 30 • C [99,110].Under heat stress, many pathways are activated by plant metabolism to mitigate the effect of heat stress.These all are interlinked with gene expression by which heat shock proteins are produced as special proteins of low molecular weight.The principal mechanism employed by plants to mitigate the effects of heat stress involves the synthesis of heat shock proteins.This mechanism constitutes a conserved molecular system in many plants to produce heat shock proteins to mitigate the effects of high temperatures.JA is recognized as a prominent phytohormone with a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of numerous secondary metabolites, as well as the induction of heat shock proteins and other phytohormones.Consequently, JA assumes a significant regulatory role in the modulation of heat shock protein production within plants [95,111].
## (s22) Jasmonic Acid Enhances Plant Tolerance against Cold Stress
(p22.0) Low temperature is also considered very lethal for the growth and nourishment of plants.Plant growth is optimum during an optimal growth temperature.When the temperature deviates from the optimal range, plants typically undergo a series of physical, biochemical, physiological, and molecular alterations as part of their normal response [112].
## (s23) Jasmonic Acid Signaling Helps Plant to Tackle Flooding Stress
(p23.0) Naturally, water is a fundamental requisite for plant growth; however, an excess of water can induce deleterious impacts on plant growth.Plants have adapted various strategies to cope with the flooding situation like adventitious root production, aerenchyma production, root hair development, and shoot growth to mitigate the effect of flooding.We can define flooding as a situation for plants when only plant roots are exposed to a very high content of water and this excessive flooding water causes hindrances in the gas transportation in the rhizosphere portion of plants [96,108].Usually, oxygen dispersion is 10,000 times slower in water as compared to the atmosphere.So, water logging conditions may be a severe disadvantage for plant growth.Jasmonic acid has been found to play a very vital role in the production of aerenchyma and root hair development because it, along with ethylene, has a better impact on plant growth under flooding situations.In another investigation, the role of ethylene in the formation of aerenchyma was shown.So, ethylene along with JA plays a significant function in producing root hairs to alleviate the effect of flooding stress [23,83].

(p23.1) The exogenous application of JA through foliar spray enhances the production of ethylene.Thus, JA may increase the production of ethylene which is very helpful for aerenchyma cells.In soybeans, it was observed that foliar spray greatly increased the ethylene contents which led to aerenchyma cell development and, overall, this reduced the effects of flooding water [35,47].Flooding stress is controlled by different phytohormones, and JA is one of them.Taking these mechanistic strategies into consideration, the possible mechanisms under flooding stress are portrayed (Figure 7).
