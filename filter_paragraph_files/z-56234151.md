## (s0) I. INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) D IGITALdata plays an essential role in our life.The digital data includes videos, images, documents, sound and etc.One of the most important digital media is video especially the dynamic one.The video represents a rich source of information.The video can contain all the other digital data such as images, sound, and text.In addition, the video is characterized by its temporal consistency.The rapid progress of digital devices causes inflation in video database.Retrieving the required information from video database according to user needs is called a video retrieval process.A video retrieval is considered a branched field from the globalized one called information retrieval.Information retrieval is considered as a subfield of computer science that is concerned with the organization and retrieval of information from large database collections [2].Video retrieval methods are important and essential for multimedia applications such as video search engines, digital museums, video-on-demand broadcasting, and etc.

(p0.1) Video retrieval is still an active problem due the semantic gap , and the wide spread of social media and the enormous technological development.To guarantee an efficient video retrieval with these huge amounts of videos on the web or even stored on the storage media is a difficult problem. the causation of semantic gap is difference between user requirements which are represented in queries and the low level representation of videos on the storage media.Many methods are proposed to solve this semantic gap, but it stills uncovered.In this paper, a concise overview on the contentbased video retrieval is mentioned.After that, the definition and the causes of a semantic gap in video retrieval will be explored.As the concept detectors play a vital role in semantic video retrieval, a thorough study of the obstacles that face the construction of generic concept detectors will be presented.Finally, The different methods which model semantic concepts relationships in video retrieval are categorized and explained in more details.
## (s1) II. VIDEO RETRIEVAL
(p1.0) V IDEO retrieval is concerned with retrieving specific videos shots according to user needs (usually called query).Video retrieval is still an active problem due to the enormous technological development that allows easy video capturing and sharing.To guarantee an efficient video retrieval with these huge amounts of videos on the web or even stored on the storage media is a difficult problem.Video retrieval process includes video segmentation process, video low level features extraction process, high level concepts extraction process, video indexing, and query processing process, shown in figure [1].High level concepts and semantics extraction process may include concept detectors and video benchmarking.In this paper, the Video retrieval research is classified into content-based video retrieval, semantic gap, concept detectors, and semantic video retrieval.In figure [2], integration and interrelation of content-based video retrieval and semanticbased video retrieval are shown.In figure [2], it illustrates the different categories and methods of video retrieval.Feature extraction process includes extracting static features of key frames, object features, and motion features.In general, content-based video retrieval is specified for extracting low level features from video [11], see figure [2].The indexed video with low level features can meet only query by example, where this query is supplied with a frame, image, or a sketch to get a target video.
## (s3) C. Concept Detectors
(p3.0) Due to the inability of the content based retrieval approach to cover the semantic gab, some approaches try to detect some semantic concepts in a specific field or domain.These approaches include detecting sunsets [18], indoor and outdoor [8], etc [19].However, these tailored methods can not support the plethora of concepts.therefore,there is a must to emerge large scale concept detection [19].But, to create generic large scale concept detectors, there are some problems that represent as challenges such as:
## (s6) 1) Bayesian Network
(p6.0) In [12], it identifies the highlight events in soccer video including goal event, corner kick event, penalty kick event, and card event.The proposed semantic analysis is frame-based instead of shot-based.Also, it introduces high-level, semantics-based content description analysis for reliable media access and navigation service based on the DBN (dynamic Bayesian network).It also introduces a so-called temporal intervening network to improve the accuracy of the semantic analysis.What most distinguishes this research is adding the temporal intervening network to DBN to improve the semantic interpretation accuracy.
## (s7) 2) Hidden Markov Model
(p7.0) In [24], some algorithms are presented to classify and segment the soccer video.It is based on two defined semantics elements are play and break.Then it describes the observations of soccer game and according to the observations the features set are selected.At last, the segmentation and classification are made by HMM(hidden markov models) followed by dynamic programing.The statistical analysis has proven that the classification accuracy is about 83.5%.3) Factor Graph [16] proposes a factor graph framework which models the stochastic relationships between different concepts features.The product sum algorithm is used to enhance the concept detection accuracy.It proves that the factor graph can handle the stochastic relationships between features extracted from the multimodality.
## (s9) 2) Association rules
(p9.0) In [15],it tries to exploit the inter-concept association relationships based on concept annotation of video shots, which discover the hidden association between concepts.These associations rules are generated using the Apiriori algorithm and theses rules are used to improve the detection accuracy of concept detectors using a combined ranking scheme.The combined ranking scheme integrates the detection scores of the associated concepts detectors according to the association rules to infer the presence of the implied concept and rerank shots.This paper also explores several statistical measurements for testing whether temporal dependence among neighboring shots are statistically significant .itexcludes that there are temporal dependency between shots for different concepts where the temporal distance ranged from 1 to 20 for different concepts ( such as sports, weather, maps and explosion).So, it smoothies the prediction of a shot with respect to a concept by a weighted combination of the inference values of its neighboring shots.Experiments on the TRECVID 2005 dataset show that the proposed framework is both efficient and effective in improving the accuracy of semantic detection in video.
## (s10) 3) First-Order Logic Rules
(p10.0) In [3],it proposes a framework for semantic event annotation that constructs an ontology model, referred to as Pictorially Enriched Ontology model.This ontology includes concepts and their visual descriptors, and a method to learn a set of first-order logic rules that describes events.The proposed learning method is an adaptation of the First Order Inductive Learner technique (FOIL).The framework improves the precision and recall, however it is tested on a limited set of concepts such as airplane flying, airplane takeoff, airplane landing, and airplane taxiing.But, this method needs other techniques to learn constants and function symbols.4) Fuzzy Temporal Horn Logic [2],This paper proposes an approach for video annotation and retrieval based on ontologies and concept detectors.Its ontology based on the semantic linguistic relations between concepts using word net.A rule-based method is used for the automatic semantic annotation for complex events.The rules are constructed using semantic web rules language (SWRL).Finally, it develops a web search engine that depends on ontologies and allows queries using a composition of Boolean and temporal relations.This paper can be improved by generating automatic-rules from the ontology.Also, it will be more effective and efficient if the rules can handle the uncertainty nature of the semantic detectors, and using the fuzzy temporal Horn logic to overcome the limitations of (SWRL).

(p10.1) In [21], this paper builds a context linear space which models the relationships between concepts.The first step removes the redundant concepts.After that it constructs a relationship matrix which models concepts relationships.byapplying a spectral composition on the relationship matrix, and then the context is getting orthogonal.Then the similarity between concepts is measured directly by getting the cosine similarities between concepts on context space.If there is a new concept not found in the context space; this new concept is projected on the context space and measure the similarity between the target concept and the other concepts.The highest similarities top-k concepts are selected and fused to measure the new concept in the video.This approach shows improvements of performance that is ranged from 2.8% to 38.8% on annotated data.This method can be extended to include negative and positive concept detectors in measuring the existence of the target concept.Context spaces that were learned from manual annotations and concept detections can be fused to generate a new measure for the target concept.
## (s13) 5) Fuzzy
(p13.0) In [6],this paper proposes a new method to improve semantic concept detection using fuzzy ontology.The semantic concept/context information is extracted from the annotated data.a fuzzy ontology is constructed using fuzzy description logic to handle the uncertainty of contextual data.an abduction engine is used to extract more rules within concepts and context.The precision of improvement using LSCOM ontology is 11%.However, the improvement in semantic concept detection is 21% via its constructed fuzzy ontology.The recall is improved about 2% for only 5 out of 17 concepts.The improvement of the precision has declined.The proposed method should include others knowledge sources and tested on large scale of concepts.

(p13.1) In [22],This paper proposes an approach called conceptdriven multimodality fusion.It maps a multi-modality query to the large number of semantic concepts instead of a query class, and use the selected concepts to determine the fusion weights.The fusion method is divided into two stages: query-to-concepts mapping and context modeling.In query-to-concept mapping, a random walk process is used to determine relevancies of concepts-to-query.The second stage process these relevancies are transformed into a fusion weights, thorough a fuzzy transformation with a relation matrix.The proposed approach doesn't produce excellent performance for all queries.
