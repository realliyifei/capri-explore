## (s1) Oscillation Criteria for Equation (1)
(p1.0) In 1982, several interesting sufficient conditions for the oscillation of all solutions to Equation (1) were established in an article by Ladas and Stavroulakis [11] (see also the paper in 1984 by Arino et al. [12]), where they studied the equation with several constant delay arguments of the form

(p1.1) under the assumption that lim inf t→∞ t t−τ i /2 p(s)ds > 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, and proved that each one of the following conditions lim inf
