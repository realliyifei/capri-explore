## (s7) Strategy adopted for literature search
(p7.0) Based on Moher et al. [53] description of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, information on the review was generated from prominent databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, BioMed Central, JSTOR, African Plant, New York Botanical Garden, Brazilian Flora Online, Global Biodiversity Information), journals, books, and/or chapters, thesis, dissertations, and conference proceedings, when Daniellia oliveri was cross-referenced with terminologies such as medicinal plants, indigenous uses, ethnoveterinary potentials, phytochemistry, bioactive compounds, secondary metabolites, pharmacological effects, biological properties, toxicity or side effects, quality control, and nutritional benefits between 1994 and 2023, resulting in a total number of 121 scientific documents out of 134 downloaded or identified records.documents and remove (where necessary) duplicated information and those that do not align with the scope of the review.
## (s10) Analgesic/antinociceptive
(p10.0) Moderate to severe pain are witnessed in 1 out of every 5 individuals globally and only 1 in every 3 of such cases or sufferers have the capability to live a life independent of pain [36].The use of plants are conventionally explored to manage pain aside the pharmacological use of opioids (anagelsics) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.A number of MP not limited to D. oliveri are in recent times used in the management of pains.

(p10.1) The antinociceptive effect of the aqueous stem bark extract [at concentrations 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)] of the plant was evaluated using the hot plate and paw pressure pain models on mice.The modes of analgesic effect of the extract, diclofenac, and morphine (standard drugs) were also studied in the presence of three antagonistic drugs (theophylline, naloxone, and glibenclamide).It was observed that the extract and standard (diclofenac) reduced the pain threshold of the animals dose-dependently, though, the effect was more prominent at the higher concentrations of the extract.The mechanism of antinociceptive action of the plant depicted no analgesic response for the three antagonistic drugs when administered alone, however, it resulted in the activation of the opioid receptor (concerned with pain modulation in mammals) for naloxone (which is a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist) to elicit an antinociceptive effect.The study also demonstrated its antinociceptive action by activating the blocked ATP-sensitive K + channel opening inhibited by glibenclamide (an ATP-sensitive K + channel blocker) in the hot plate test [36].Recently in a related study, lower concentrations (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg b.w) of ethanolic stem bark extract was assessed following acetic acid induced (interperitoneal) nociception of experimental mice.The study found out that the extracts dose-dependently showed moderate antinociceptive effect with 35.61%, 48.07%and 61.40% inhibition respectively, though the activity of the extracts were inferior to the standard (acetylsalicylic acid) having inhibition score of 91.93% [55].
## (s13) Anthelminthic/antifilarial
(p13.0) The continued survival of livestock (small ruminant) are partly dependent on the possible eradication of worm nematodes.The importance of these animals in farming operation necessitate keeping them healthy to prevent economic losses [57,75].While anthelmintics such as levamisole are used to keep these parasites at bay, however, their high cost and side effects have warranted plant-based formulations in recent times as probable alternatives.

(p13.1) Kabore et al. [57] studied the larvicidal potential of aqueous stem bark extract of D. oliveri on Haemonchus conturtus at three developmental stages (eggs, first larvae, and adults) of life in an in vitro experiments (egg hatch and embryonated egg assays) at varying concentrations (75, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400 μg/ml).The study established dose-dependent activities for eggs and first larvae (L1) stages depicting a 100% inhibition or mortality at the highest two concentrations (1200 and 2400 μg/ml).The effective dose (ED 50 ) of the extract for the egg hatching assay (EHA) and embryonated egg (EEA) was reported to be 245.9 and 362.3 μg/ml respectively indicating the anthelminthic activity of the plant.However, the mortality of adult worms after 24 h exposure to the extract was not only thorough and inconsistent in terms of concentration-activity relationship but was in contrast with findings from levamisole (standard drug) depicting a dose-dependent activity with 100% mortality of the worms.
## (s14) Anti-inflammatory
(p14.0) Inflammation manifest various signs like redness, heat, swelling, or pain [31] as a result of the body's response to an attack [76].The pharmacological treatment of these symptoms are with the use of either steroid or non-steroidal drugs (NSAIDs) which are however prone to side effects [31], hence, the exploration of MP like D. oliveri as an alternative option.
## (s15) Antimelanogenesis
(p15.0) Inflammation, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, cell proliferation have been attributed to reasons for various skin deformities [77] such as skin darkening, keloids, and scars.While therapy involves surgery, intralesional injection, 5 fluorouracil, radiotherapy, among others, the use of natural products such as D. oliveri are considered as effective therapy due to various side effects from these pharmacological treatments [78,79].

(p15.1) The antimelanogenesis effect of daniellic acid (compound) isolated from the oleoresin of the plant was evaluated on B16F10 and Malme-3M melanocytes in a cell line study conducted in Burkina Faso by Nacoulma et al. [52].The chloroform (diluted) oleoresin extract following various chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques produced daniellic acid which was investigated to inhibit B16F10 and Malme-3M melanocytes production since melanin plays an essential role in the prevention of the skin from ultraviolet exposure.It was reported that daniellic acid halted the production of the B16F10 cell line by half.Similar activity was witnessed with Malme-3M melanocyte where it depicted superior inhibition compared to kojic acid (standard).Other activities (antioxidant, cytotoxic, and anti-tyrosinase) of the compound as reported in this study were summarized in Table 4.The present review identified that none of the major parts (leaves, stem bark, and roots) of the plant were evaluated to check the antimelanogenesis activity of the plant.Besides, the established activities were only based on cell line and in vitro evaluations and since it is a known fact that sometimes activity related to in vitro assessments do not in most cases necessarily translate into in vivo results, hence, the need to replicate these findings (crude extract and identified compound) in an animal model.
## (s16) Antimicrobial
(p16.0) Infectious diseases are responsible for almost half of all deaths particularly in tropical nations [60].Antibiotics and/or other multi-drug resistant agents are potentially used to curb microbial infections, however, due to organisms resistant or side effects has necessitated the new search (MP) for alternative therapeutic solution.

(p16.1) A number of studies on the antimicrobial effectiveness of different parts of the plant have been submitted from Nigeria.Typically, a comparative study [60] on the leaves, bark, and root aqueous and ethanol extracts of D. oliveri were tested against various strains of bacteria (such as Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) in a broth dilution method using 100 mg/ml concentration.The study revealed that ethanolic root extract showed a wide inhibition zone (5-7 mm) on the tested bacteria strains indicating enhanced activity compared to other extracts (in terms of the solvent of extraction and plant part).The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of strains differs among the bacteria organisms [K.pneumonia (6.25-25 mg/ml), S. aureus (6.25-100 mg/ml), P. aeruginosa (50-100 mg/ml) and E. coli (50-100 mg/ml) and higher than gentamycin (12.5-25.0μg/ml) indicating the inferior antibacterial effects of the extracts.

(p16.2) The antifungal effectiveness of aqueous and methanolic leaves and stem bark extracts of the plant at varying concentration ranges (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/ml) on eight fungal strains (Trichophyton floccosum, Aspergillus niger, Candida krusei, Rhizopus stolonifer, Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, Epidermophyton floccosum and Trichophyton interdigitale) through agar diffusion and broth dilution methods to determine the zone of inhibitions (ZID) and MIC.The study established moderate and good inhibitions of the organisms especially mould fungi species (A.niger, R. stolonifera) and yeast (C.albicans, C. krusei) with a zone of inhibition values ranging between 10 -14 mm and 10-26 mm respectively by the methanolic leaves extract; the activity of the extract was better than ketoconazole and tioconazole (10 mg/ml).Additionally, the methanolic stem bark showed good activities on the tested strains, though less effective to the leaf.The ZID result was corroborated by the MIC findings.The MIC of the leaf methanolic extract was found at 3.125 mg/ml for C. albicans and T. rubrum.Hence, indicates the antifungal effect of the plant, particularly the methanolic leaf extract.

(p16.3) In an effort to assess the antimicrobial properties of D. oliveri across wide solvent ranges, Nwuche and Eze [61] investigated the impact of aqueous (cold and hot), methanol, ethanol, and acetone stem extracts on a range of broad-spectrum organisms such as S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, K pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli and C. albicans using broth dilution method across diverse concentration ranges.The study established organic solvents showing good antimicrobial activity even at the lowest concentration (6.25 mg/ml) against all the tested microorganism strains.The aqueous extracts showed similar activity, however the cold extract shower weaker inhibitions of the tested strains except with S. aureus and C. albicans where a comparable effect (at 25 mg/ml) was observed.While the outcome from the study showed the better effectiveness of ethanol among the organic solvents for the organisms, the sensitivity to inhibitions of the tested gram-positive organisms was reported to be more pronounced above gram-negative bacteria species.The findings from the investigation corroborated earlier findings on the superior activity of the organic extracts over the aqueous extract, especially for the stem plant part.
## (s21) Neurological
(p21.0) The neurological effect of the root part of the plant was investigated by Beppe et al. [14] in in vivo technique.The aqueous root extract at 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg b.w. was evaluated on diazepam-induced amnesia in Swiss albino mice during the 14-day experimental period.The learning and memory of the animals evaluated using the radial arm maze and T-maze established 200 mg/kg b.w. to most efficiently increase the preferred arm compared with the dementia group; the positive effect was also shared by piracetam (150 mg/kg b.w.).Additionally, the increased number of returns of the arm as a result of the diazepam induction was brought down by the doses of the extract.Increased MDA content was reversed significantly (p < 0.001) with 100 mg/kg b.w.while the reduced glutathione concentration was enhanced significantly (p < 0.001) by the doses of the extract especially the 200 mg/kg b.w.The histopathological observation of the hippocampus revealed the presence of abnormal architecture (granular cell at the dentate gyrus) with evidence of cell degeneration in the diazepam without treatment group; however, these aberrations were reversed with 300 mg/kg b.w.indicating the neuroprotective action of the plant.For the purpose of conservation, it will be appropriate that the aerial parts (leaves and stem bark) be evaluated for neurological potential and the likely compounds responsible for the activity be determined for possible drug development.
## (s23) Cardiotoxic
(p23.0) Cardiovascular ailments (CVD) as one of the leading causes of death globally [90] are groups of diseases associated with the heart and blood vessels [68].While the management can either or both be non-pharmacological (exercise, diets etc.) and use of synthetic drugs.However due to accompanying side effects from the latter, numerous MP including Daniellia oliveri have been found to be effective in its therapy [91].
## (s25) Other uses and applications
(p25.0) The odour and or aromatic resin produced from the burning of bark or wood of D. oliveri are used as a mosquito repellent in homes of most African countries not limited to the Gambia and Guinea Bissau, this is as reported by Atolani and Olatunji [51] in works of Snow [96], Lindslay and Janney [97] and Paalson and Jaenson [98].Ethnoveterinary use of this plant in some African nations including Burkina Faso, Cameroon for the control of gastro-intestinal parasites has also been submitted [99,100].Interestingly some of the nutritional uses have also been verified scientifically.Typically, a study by Okunade et al. [101] reported the improvement in nutritional benefit (increased feed intake and weight gain), rumen fermentation, and microbial ecology of Yankassa male lambs whose diets were fortified with different concentrations (50, 100, 150 g/kg) of D. oliveri seed meal with the highest concentration exhibiting the best performance or outcome.

(p25.1) A related study by Olufadehan et al. [102] determined the importance of fortifying the meal with leaf extract of D. oliveri on carcass quality, nutritional retention, and caeca microbial population of day-old chicken during a 56-day experimental study.They found out that administration of 40 ml/l extract of the plant enhances the proliferation of Lactobacillus and similarly does not cause any dangerous or deleterious effect on the caeca quality and performance or activity of the chicks.Further nutritional benefit was also found in a study by Osakwe et al. [103] where ammonia level in the rumen and nutrient digestibility were evaluated in small ruminant animals (such as sheep) upon consumption and found it to be a good fodder plant despite its high condensed tannin content.Additionally, the benefit of the plant nutritionally was also established in broiler chickens fed (fortification) with leaf extract of the plant and used as an antibiotic alternative to the regular diets fed to day-old chickens in a study that lasted 56 days.The outcome revealed that AI increased with increasing concentrations of the extract and thus concluded the enhancement of general performance of the animals by promoting the fatty acids composition and meat quality [104].
## (s26) Discussion
(p26.0) Medicinal plant usage in the treatment and or management of diseases is an age-long tradition.Indigenous medicine is now in recent times recognized within the national healthcare system or policy of most countries [113].The effectiveness of herbal medicine on these illnesses is attributed to the richness in the arrays of embedded secondary metabolites and or compounds.Interestingly, D. oliveri is not an exception as various parts (leaves, stem, and roots) of the plants possessed several secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, alkaloids, saponins peculiar to most West African countries (Mali, Nigeria, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Cote D'Ivoire and Togo) where studies on the plant have been attributed to numerous established pharmacological potentials including antimicrobial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antiwrinkle, antimalarial, antimelanogenesis, antidiarrhoea, antisickling, hepatoprotective, cytotoxic and safety potentials.In fact, typical of some of these compounds isolated from this plant are rutin and quercetin reported or known from the literature to exhibit peculiar pharmacological potentials not limited to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer (quercetin) [114] as well as antioxidant, antiviral, anticancer, neuroprotective, cardioprotective (rutin) [115].Although, it suffices to mention that variation existed in the presence or detection of some other compounds such as terpenes, sterols, glycosides, carbohydrates, and reducing sugars in the same part of the plants going by findings submitted by authors from these countries.The differences in compound classes as observed and summarized in this review are not surprising as such variations are attributed to differences in geographical locations whether in the soil type, weather condition, state of maturity, harvest time, and so on.While the review establishes and applauds the huge number of phytoconstituents obtained from various extracts/fractions of the plant (and its parts) as determined through a few analytical methods from different regions, however, the lack of further purification of the fractions to be able to identify bioactive compounds is a gap that requires to be investigated from the established biological and pharmacological potentials and/or applications.

(p26.1) Notwithstanding the fact that the review found the predominant use of water and polar solvents such as ethanol and methanol (alcohol) as the most suitable medium for extraction in indigenous medicine [116] while the stem bark was the majorly explored part of the plant for extract formulation accounting for 47% followed by the leaves with 35%.The leaf part would have been expected to reveal the highest usage percentage from an ethnobotanical point of view based on the clamour for its use to encourage biodiversity, however, this report identifies and buttressed the wide choice of the stem (bark) part for many ailments by the indigenous people and/or medicinal plant users of West Africa.The reason for this could be partly because the part is greatly explored for other purposes such as firewood and as repellent for mosquitoes.

(p26.2) In an effort towards drug development, preliminary assays such as in vitro and in vivo evaluations, as well as toxicity studies, are important to be carried out as a way of partly confirming the indigenous usage and to guide decision-making on further studies such as preclinical and clinical trials.Literature reports established that to a larger extent, the plant was well studied in vitro and in vivo (to a smaller extent) against a number of diseases accounting for 52% and 37% respectively of the overall reported experimental models.The below-average percentage in animal-model reports may signify that a number of these established pharmacological effects needed to be confirmed in vivo.Toxicity evaluation accounted for 11% of the total reported investigations and no clinical study report on the plant at the time of compiling this review was established, hence, above all, it would be encouraged that more focus and or efforts on in vivo, preclinical in vivo, and translational experimental designs or studies centering on 'omics' (metabolomics, proteomics, genomics, and transcriptomics) applications and concept are required to be put forward on the plant which would serve as a template or preliminary basis for further studies such as clinical trials towards developing novel drugs since it is a known fact that findings from in vitro evaluation may not necessarily translate into in vivo outcomes.Although, while no clinical trial studies were found in the literature with respect to this plant, clinical relevance of medicinal plants generally has continued to increase based on their acceptance and usage by (conventional) physicians and/or pharmacists in the management of different diseases, thus, playing a pivotal role in the elongation of human life [117] Interestingly, D. oliveri is not an exception to this concept.Besides, the various pharmacological and safety attributes established on this plant in both in vitro and in vivo testing are indications of likely positive feedback or sign of successful outcomes by the time the plant is eventually subjected to clinical trials.

(p26.3) Deductions from the review also indicated that more than 95% of the studies took place in West Africa with Nigeria recording the highest percentage.While the reason for this could be due to the wide distribution of the plant across this region of the globe, it may also points to the fact that the plant had not been adequately explored or is still underutilized which is concerning, and until this is achieved globally, the full therapeutic potentials may not be realized or attained.Hence, though considerable pharmacological potentials of the plant particularly in in vitro evaluations have been established and laudable, the review identified the need for the reported activities to be replicated in other continents of the world so as to give a thorough insight into the effectiveness of the plant on many disease conditions across wider populations and cultures.Similarly, across the board, validation of in vitro investigation in animal models as well as in clinical trials are necessary.Above all, it can be concluded that despite the fact that the review was able to establish numerous nutritional and pharmacological benefits of the plant attributed to various chemical and bioactive components; thus providing insights into likely development of probable natural moieties against a number of diseases, it is still evident that much research undertakings are needed on the identified grey areas (for the afore-mentioned to be achieved) in order for the multitherapeutic effect of the plant to be maximally explored.
