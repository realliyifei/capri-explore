## (s1) Nutritional quality of plant diets
(p1.0) The nutritional value of soybean, sunflower, canola and cottonseed (seed meals), kikuyu (leaf meal) and azolla (aquatic plant meal) was determined using data from the literature.Crude protein, lipids, carbohydrates and ash of each of these plants were recorded.The essential amino acid index of each plant was determined using Penaflorida (1989) formula given below:

(p1.1) where aa is the amount of amino acid in the insect ingredient, AA is the requirement of the same amino acid in fish tissue, and n is the total number of amino acids used in the calculation.Thus, the EAAI is a ratio between the concentration of amino acid in the ingredient and the requirement of the fish for the amino acid.
## (s3) formulating least-cost diets for tilapia farmers
(p3.0) Least-cost plant diets were formulated for sub-adult tilapias in Excel using the SOLVER function as described by Rapatsa and Moyo (2022).The plant ingredients, their cost, crude protein and metabolizable energy were listed as a database.The feeds were balanced for protein and energy.In the SOLVER function the cost US$/kg was selected as the target cell and the optimum diet was produced.
## (s5) discussion
(p5.0) The estimated protein requirement for tilapias is between 30 and 45% depending on the size of the fish (El-Sayed and Tashima, 1992).Soybean, sunflower, cottonseed and canola seed meals evidently meet the protein requirements of tilapias.Soybean meal has extensively been used in the formulation of tilapia diets more than any of the other plants (Shiau et al., 1990;Soltan et al., 2001;Merida et al., 2010;Ahmad et al., 2020).Phytate, tannins and trypsin inhibitors are some of the common anti-nutritional factors found in soybean meal.The application of heat has been suggested as one of the ways to get rid of anti-nutritional factors in soybean meal, but not all anti-nutritional factors are heat liable (Ranjan et al., 2019).Sunflower meal has lower sulphur containing amino acids compared to soybean meal.Sunflower meal is high in fibre and phenolic compounds, both of which reduce protein solubility.However, despite its limitations sunflower meal is cheaper than soybean meal.The main anti-nutritional factor in cotton seed meal is gossypol (Lim and Lee, 2011).This is a phenolic aldehyde that acts as an inhibitor for several dehydrogenase enzymes.The amino acid profile of cottonseed meal is not good because none of the sulphur containing amino acids meet the requirement of tilapias.Cottonseed meal is generally less expensive per unit of protein than soybean meal and is highly palatable.Canola meal has a relatively high protein content compared to other oilseed meals except for soybean meal.However, its amino acid profile is poor because very few of the essential amino acids meet the requirements for tilapias.The main limitation of using canola meal is its high glucosinolates (GLS), phenolic compounds, phytate and fibre (Khajali and Slominski, 2012).Canola meal's nutritive value is also dependent on the oil extraction and processing method.From a nutritional perspective, the plant ingredients were ranked as azolla meal> soybean meal> cottonseed meal> canola seed meal> sunflower meal> kikuyu meal.
