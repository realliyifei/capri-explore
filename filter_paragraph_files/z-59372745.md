## (s3) Machining of Aluminium
(p3.0) Aluminium (Al) and Al alloys are very found machineable of all the basic materials.The low melting temperature of the material and the higher thermal coefficients of expansion along with relative softness and elasticity make it necessary to disseminate the generated heat.Else, it is difficult to keep up tolerances of the workpiece.Al alloys normally have significant measures of Si, causing them to be adhesive, leading to quick heat formation resulting in chip welding and built up edge 18 .At the point when contrasted with alternate materials, the machining of Al combinations is much easier as it is a comparatively soft material, thus resulting in a longer tool life and much reduced cutting forces.Be that as it may, notwithstanding these properties, for an agreeable result, alternate components that additionally must be fulfilled are the issues of material adhesion and also the development of BUE that reduces the tool life and causes other machining issues.Subsequently, optimized tool geometry as well as the machining parameters is highly recommended for the machining of Al and its Al alloys in order to accomplish proper results 19 .
## (s4) Machining of Amcs
(p4.0) Aluminium Matrix Composites (AMCs) are extremely difficult to machine due to their abrasive properties and the wear rate of the tools is also high, so that machining is extremely expensive 20 .The evaluation of machining of SiC reinforced aluminium matrix composite showed that initial flank wear on brazed polycrystalline diamond and chemical vapour deposition diamond coated tools were generated by abrasion due to the presence of very hard SiC particles 21 .For proper machining of Al/SiCMMC at high speed and low depth of cut, without BUC or flank BUC, the rhombic and fixed circular toolings are most effective tooling systems 22 .During machining of Al (Situ Al 4 C 3 ) metal matrix composite, elemental and arc chips formation were observed and hardness increased due to high volume fraction of situ Al 4 C 3 in the MMC.It resulted in a decrease in the formation of BUE but increased the surface quality at high cutting speeds 23 .Diamond tools are reasonably suitable for MMC machining.Furthermore, diamond coatings appeared to be more economically viable than PCD for MMC machining 24 .The machining of MMCs has been difficult due to the extremely abrasive nature of the reinforcements and presents a significant challenge to the industry 25 .During machining of Al-Al 2 O 3 MMC it was found that at lower cutting speeds and due to lack of formation of a lubricating layer, the friction between the abrasive particle and the cutting tool can be reduced.The tool life was increased, under wet conditions, when turning at higher speeds.However, the surface quality was disintegrated, due to the flushing away of the partially debonded particulates from the machined surface.In this manner, higher rate of pit gaps and voids were formed 26 .The cutting force during machining of AMC is based on particle fracture, ploughing and chip generation.Thus the resistance offered by SiC particles against fracture, ploughing out and makes it difficult to machine 27 .The surface roughness values were predicted experimentally using fuzzy logic modelling technique in drilling of Al-SiC composite.The feed is the primary parameter which affects the surface roughness of Al-SiC composite, followed by point angle, tool material, speed and cutting environment 28 .When machining the (Ti) MMCs, the tool wear at the initial wear system was completely different from the steady wear system.During the initial wear period, the adhesion is the most essential wear mechanism under all exploratory cutting conditions.At the main snapshot of machining, the impact of accelerated cutting force and temperature gradient promptly to high stress and friction between the cutting tool and material surfaces; hence, the tool layer damage 29 .During machining of Hybrid Metal Matrix Composite, the surface roughness mainly depends on the feed rate followed by the cutting speed.Influence of the approach angle is less on the surface roughness of the metal matrix composite.Optimization of machining parameters, nose radius and operation conditions were very important for minimizing the tool wears; maximizing the metal removal rate and better machinability 30 .

(p4.1) Machining can be improved by the application of MQL From the machining study, it is revealed that machining of prepared composite is tough because of the abrasive nature of the hard particles.It also found from the review of the literature that the use of coolant during turning of composites increases wear of the tool and surface roughness.The flank wear rate is higher at lessen cutting speed due to the producing of high cutting forces and formation of BUE during traditional machining of prepared composites.The hard reinforced particles in the composites do not part off during machining at low cutting speed by the action of the cutting tool edge.Its rolls over the cutting tool edge and plough over the machined surface, which may cause of creation of high cutting force and formation of poor surface finish.Low feed and low cutting speed gives lower flank wear and thus better tool life in both coated and uncoated inserts when machining the prepared metal matrix composites.Flank wear of coated tool is less when compared with the uncoated insert.
