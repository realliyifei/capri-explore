[27]This has posed threats to laissez faire pattern, security of career and socioeconomic mobility of the professionals. [1,19]
## (s9) Medical education's role in healthcare professionalism
(p9.0) Whenever in the history of mankind, materialism would come up as a killer of humanity and the moral values deteriorated, prophets from within the same people with divine guidance would be deputed by Almighty to educate the people in faith and moralities.This golden strategy holds true even today and the prophetly activity of education still has and shall continue to have the full potential to reverse the deteriorating moralities.Hence medical education is of paramount importance [23] to inculcate deep rooted professionalism which is central to sustaining the public's trust in the medical professionals.
