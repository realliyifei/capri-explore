## (s22) Security and Safety
(p22.0) There is incessant robbery attacks on Nigerian roads and recurring spateof hapless killings in some parts of Nigeria. This insecurity accelerates the cost of doing business either through direct loss of goods and properties or the cost of taking precautions against business risks and uncertainty. These costs could have a negative impact on business development and progress (Okonkwo, 2015).The Nigeria insecurity situation in many cases, actually halted business operations during the periods of violence and also caused the outright closure of many enterprises especially in the areas or zones where incidences of insecurity is rife and are on daily occurrence, in a bid to protect lives of operators and business property.
