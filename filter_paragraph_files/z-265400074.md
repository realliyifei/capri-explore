## (s3) Novel antimicrobial proteins
(p3.0) Mucus functions in innate immune mechanism in two ways: i) it is produced continuously and sloughed off regularly to carry away adhered microbes and parasites; ii) contains several different proteins and enzymes thereby act as innate immunity factors e.g.immunoglobulin, complement proteins, lysozyme, C-reactive protein (CRP), lectins, proteolytic enzymes, transferrin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and various other antibacterial proteins and peptides [16][17][18][19].Studies have reported that antimicrobial proteins found in fish mucus exhibit inhibitory effects against various bacteria e.g.Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and fungi e.g.Candida albicans, Issatchenkia orientalis [20].
## (s4) Burn treatment bandage and leather
(p4.0) Due to presence of type I collagen and high moisture content, tilapia skin is able to withstand mechanical stress e.g.stretching.Tilapia skin bandage in treatment of second-and third-degree burn patients accelerates healing and reduces pain medications, thus, decreases treatment cost by more than 60 % in contrast to conventional treatment.To prepare fish skin bandage, the skin is sterilized chemically, then glycerolized, irradiated and finally stored aseptically in refrigerator [22,23].
## (s18) Fish collagen, gelatin, glue
(p18.0) Unlike collagen from pig skin and cattle bones, fish collagen is free from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and owes less or no religious and ethical concerns [95].Collagen is a multifunctional protein e.g.high porosity, low immunogenicity, able to penetrate a lipid-free interface [96].Collagen inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and show anti-inflammatory function [97].The main applications of collagen are drug delivery systems, controlling material for transdermal and gene delivery, collagen-based sponges for wounds and fundamental matrices for cell culture systems, tissue engineering, food and cosmetics industries [95,98].
## (s26) Considerations on use of fish waste as raw material
(p26.0) Studies have been conducted over last 100 years in attempt to valorize fish waste through conversion of waste into products such as fish protein concentrates, fish oil, and fish meal.Techno-econo-environmental issues should be considered in utilization of fish waste as raw material.These considerations are also important to evaluate feasibility of products development in industrial-scale from lowvalue or from fish species which are less preferred for human consumption.Although in the Scotland due to cheap disposal cost, fish wastes are not generally considered for other applications, but on the other hand, Norway is an exemplary country that has been utilizing seafood waste efficiently [153].Crist√≥bal et al. (2018) investigated potato, tomato, citrus fruits and olive waste valorization pathways in European level and found that only some particular pathways are economically profitable where market price of the produced products and economies of scale greatly function as a determinant of profitability [154].From fish waste, various products describes in the previous section of this article can be produced and as these products has important applications in medical, pharmaceutical, cosmeceuticals, food, packaging, animal feed industries, so, some fish waste valorization pathways has potential to be economically profitable.
