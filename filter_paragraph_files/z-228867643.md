## (s2) Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)
(p2.0) According to the natural ant characteristics, initially individual ants in a colony come out of the nest and depart in different directions searching for food randomly. Once they find a food source, they take some of the food back home. In their way back, they secret a chemical hormone called Pheromone. The amount of Pheromone may depend on the quality and quantity of the food. As a designated path e.g. shorter than other paths is used more and more by the ants, more Pheromone is deposited on that path. In this way, other ants are stimulated to follow the path/trail with more Pheromone and would probably prefer it to the other paths. Hence, the ants collectively use the shortest path as explained in figure 2 [21]. This process is called Stigmergy which is an indirect communication between the ants via Pheromone. It supports efficient collaboration between simple agents who lack any memory or even individual awareness of each other [22].
