## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Agricultural waste is any waste being generated from different farming processes in accumulative concentration.Adequate utilization of agricultural waste reduces environmental problems caused by irresponsible disposal of the waste.The management of agricultural wastes is indispensable and a crucial strategy in global waste management.Waste of any kind in the environment when its concentration is in excess can become a critical factor for humans, animals, and vegetation [1].The nature, quantity, and type of agricultural waste generated vary from country to country.The search for an effective way to properly manage agricultural waste will help protect the environment and the health quality.

(p0.1) For sustainable development, wastes should be recycled, reused, and channelled towards the production of value added products.This is to protect the environment on one side and on the other side to obtain value added products while establishing a zero waste standard.The utilization of the waste is a priority today in order to achieve sustainable development [2].
