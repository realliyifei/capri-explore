## (s2) Essential oils from rhizomes and cortices
(p2.0) Ethanol extract of rhizomes of Cassumunar ginger purchased in Bangkok was submitted to γ-radiation at doses of 10.0 and 25.0 kGy. EO obtained from nonirradiated and irradiated samples did not show significant changes in the content of sabinene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, cymene, α-terpinolene, terpinen-4-ol, α-terpineol, β-sesquiphellandrene, ar-turmerone, ar-curcumene, α-turmerone, β-turmerone, 4-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-ene, 4-(3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)but-1,-3-ene, (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxylphenyl)butadiene, 4-(2′,4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl) but-3-ene, and 4-(2′,4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl)but-1,3-ene [12].

(p2.1) Rhizome samples of Coptis chinensis purchased from a local market in Korea were submitted to γ-radiation at doses of 5.0, 10.0, 25.0, and 50.0 kGy. Higher total content of aldehydes and hydrocarbons was verified for irradiated samples (average values considering all irradiated materials = 11.4 and 42.7%, respectively) in relation to nonirradiated samples (7.56 and 35.98%, respectively). Higher total content of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was verified for irradiated samples at 5.0, 10.0, and 25.0 kGy (average values considering irradiated materials = 47.5, 47.5, and 42.5%, respectively) in relation to nonirradiated sample and irradiated sample at 50.0 kGy (35.0% for both the samples) [9].

(p2.2) Another rhizome sample of C. chinensis was purchased from a local market in Korea and irradiated at doses of 5.0, 10.0, 25.0, and 50.0 kGy. The total content of aldehydes in the irradiated samples (average values considering all irradiated materials = 23.1%) was similar to the nonirradiated samples (23.33%). Higher content of hydrocarbons was verified for the irradiated samples (average values considering all irradiated materials = 16.8%) in relation to the nonirradiated samples (11.21%). The total content of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was higher in the irradiated sample at 25.0 and 50.0 kGy (20.0% for both the samples) in relation to irradiated samples at 5.0 and 10.0 kGy (15.0% for both the samples) and nonirradiated sample (12.5%) [9].

The overall yield of EO extracted from irradiated leaves (0.67, 0.46, 0.72, 0.58, and 0.418%, respectively) was higher than the corresponding yield for nonirradiated samples (0.27%) [15]. The total content of acyclic monoterpenes and sesquiterpene derivatives in irradiated samples (average values considering all irradiated materials = 0.3 and 3.1%, respectively) was increased in relation to nonirradiated samples (0.11 and 1.90%, respectively). On the other hand, the total content of the other chemical classes, such as triterpenes, diterpenes, esters, and carotenoid derivatives, in irradiated samples (average values considering all irradiated materials = 0.7, 2.7, 76.1, and 3.3%, respectively) was lightly decreased in relation to nonirradiated sample (0.99, 2.93, 79.68, and 4.26%, respectively). Irradiated samples exhibited higher content of linalool, α-caryophyllene, drimenol, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, (E,E)-farnesyl acetone, ethyl hexadecanoate, methyl (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoate, and methyl (E,E,E)-11,14,17-eicosatrienoate (average values considering all irradiated materials = 0.3, 0.7, 1.5, 0.9, 1.4, 1.9, 2.3, and 11.3%, respectively) in relation to nonirradiated sample (0.11, 0.22, 0.66, 0.40, 0.93, 1.22, 1.70, and 7.94%, respectively). On the other hand, the content of dihydroedulan, β-caryophyllene, methyl hexadecanoate, ethyl (Z,Z,Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate, squalene (average values considering all irradiated materials = 0.9, 0.5, 40.0, 6.8, and 0.7%, respectively) exhibited lower relative content when the samples were not exposed to γ-radiation (2.9, 0.8, 44.3, 12.7, and 1.0%, respectively). The samples submitted to γ-radiation did not exhibit significant changes in the content of 10-(acetylmethyl)-(+)-3-carene, (E)-nerolidol, methyl (Z,Z,Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate, (E)-phytol, methyl octadecanoate, ethyl (Z,Z,Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate, and ethyl octadecanoate [15].

Both the samples did not exhibit significant differences in the content of α-pinene, eucalyptol, β-myrcene, terpinen-4-ol, sabinene, neral, α-terpineol, linalyl acetate, and β-bisabolone, which were the major constituents identified in its EO [16].

The overall yield of EO for nonirradiated and irradiated samples was similar (0.9%). Irradiated samples exhibited changes in the content of menthol and menthone (average values considering all irradiated materials = 51.6 and 14.5%, respectively) in relation to the nonirradiated sample (52.4 and 13.8%, respectively). Irradiated samples exhibited similar content of γ-gurjunene, neo-menthol, α-terpinene, α-gurjunene, neo-isomenthol 1,8-cineole, and isopulegol, in irradiated samples (average values considering all irradiated materials = 1.4, 6.4, 0.4, 8.8, 6.4, 3.7, and 1.0%, respectively) in relation to the nonirradiated sample (1.4, 6.5, 0.5, 8.9, 6.5, 3.9, and 0.8%, respectively) [17].

(p5.3) The content of α-copaene, β-elemene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and aromadendrene increased with radiation except when the plant material was exposed at a dose of 20 kGy. The content of δ-cadinene, caryophyllene oxide, and alloaromadendrene oxide-(2) increased with γ-radiation. The content of D-germacrene, γ-gurjunene, and 7-epi-α-cadinene decreased with γ-radiation in relation to the nonirradiated sample [39].
## (s7) Essential oils from overall herbs
(p7.0) Samples of Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) obtained from a local market in Ankara (Turkey) were exposed at doses of 7.0, 12.0, and 17.0 kGy.
