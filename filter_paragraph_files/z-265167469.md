## (s12) Psychological Profile, Muscular, and Cardiovascular Evaluations
(p12.0) Other important aspects to consider when prescribing an exercise program are the evaluation of motor responses and the consideration of the psychological profile.Evaluations represent a fundamental moment for understanding the real capabilities of an individual, setting up protocols and assessing results over time.People with diabetes show both impaired exercise tolerance and an excessive risk of developing heart failure, which are not entirely explained by known cardiovascular risk factors or coronary artery disease [56].The risk for cardiovascular disease and other diabetes-related complications, including neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy in persons with long-standing disease, is high, and care should be taken to properly screen individuals before recommending a new exercise program.Caution is warranted for those with advanced disease complications and medical screening; before initiating any new vigorous exercise program, a graded exercise stress test with ECG and blood pressure monitoring should be performed.The main assessments that should be made before carrying out any type of physical exercise are, in order: (i) the Health Assessment Questionnaire; (ii) assessment of balance level and risk of falls; (iii) cardiopulmonary exercise testing; (iv) the assessment of muscle strength.

(p12.1) Health assessment questionnaires [57].While several tools are available to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients with diabetes, the design and, therefore, duration of these measurements may limit their feasibility in the daily routine of a sports facility.Furthermore, these measures do not distinguish items for diabetes-specific quality of life.Thus, a specific questionnaire on the diabetics' quality of life (DMQoL) was developed with only 10 questions, sensitive to the change related to the progression of diabetes compared to the initial stages (e.g., glycemic changes).The combination of the DMQoL and the WHOQOL-BREF (the shortened version of the quality of life questionnaire designed by WHO) provides a comprehensive picture of overall health-related quality of life in patients with diabetes and improves the ability to detect changes clinically significant to the pathology.

(p12.2) Tests that determine the level of balance and the risk of falls.Patients with T2DM, particularly those ≥65 years old, exhibit an increased rate of falls.It is, therefore, important to assess the risk of falling before the prescription of an exercise intervention.The most used tests are the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), the Functional Reach Test, (FRT), the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI).Among those tests, the TUG showed the greatest sensitivity (90%) and specificity (88%) to the phenomenon [58].In this assessment, the patient gets up from a chair, walks 3 m, turns around, returns to the chair, and sits down again.This task must be completed within 10.6 s.Times between 11 and 20 s are within the normal range for frail elderly and disabled patients; times ≥20 s indicate that the person needs external assistance.A score ≥30 s predicts a higher risk of falling.

(p12.3) Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).Measurements of ventilation, gas exchange, and electrocardiography during an incremental exercise test are noninvasive protocols that provide an assessment of pulmonary, cardiovascular, and muscle function during exercise (see Table 1).The addition of echocardiographic monitoring ("imaging-CPET"), mainly used in patients with heart failure, may provide further insight into different aspects of cardiac function during exercise and their impact on exercise intolerance [59].Even though guidelines recommend the application of objective exercise prescriptions using CPET data [59], it is common to find programs without CPET information or with limited resources to establish exercise intensity on the basis of resting heart rate (e.g., exercising heart rate threshold set 20 or 30 beats/min above the resting heart rate).This simple method has been criticized and demonstrated to be inadequate by several researchers.Moreover, it should be noted that performing this test routinely and its cost mean that specific criteria must be defined regarding patients for whom it would be imperative to perform the test.Assessment of muscle strength.A significant percentage of T2DM patients (prevalence 16%, mean age 58 years old) are sarcopenic compared to age-matched healthy individuals [34].Considering that 80% of insulin-mediated glucose uptake occurs in skeletal muscle (lean mass) [60], we should consider the importance of increasing lean mass for improving glycemic control in these individuals [61].Furthermore, muscle strength is reduced by 30% to 50% in T2DM patients compared to their healthy counterparts.Dynamometry is considered the gold standard for examining muscle strength.However, considering the cost of this device and the technical skills required, this test is not feasible for those working in private and home care settings.There are different types of tests, such as handgrip strength and sit-to-stand tests.Handgrip strength shows moderate to high correlations with extremity muscle strength.The patient sits in a chair with their elbow flexed to 90 degrees and a force device in one hand.Subsequently, the patient grips the device as tightly as possible for 3 s.This test is performed three times, alternating hands.Another strength test that could be considered to assess muscle strecngth in T2DM patients is the sit-to-stand test, although the validity of this test is currently under intense debate.Briefly, in this test, the person, without the help of the hands and arms, but with only the work of the legs, must perform, in 1 min, as many reps as possible and sit with legs bent at 90 degrees.Another version foresees a 30 s duration (30s-STS) [62], and another comprises five reps executed as quickly as possible (FTSST) [63].
## (s13) Exercise Prescription
(p13.0) Regular exercise enhances overall fitness, strength, and endurance [61].It boosts energy levels and can alleviate symptoms of fatigue commonly experienced by individuals with diabetes.It is important for individuals with diabetes to consult with their healthcare team before starting an exercise program.They can provide guidance on the type, intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise that suits individual needs and medical conditions.Additionally, monitoring blood sugar levels before, during, and after exercise is crucial to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia episodes.
## (s15) Peripheral Heart Action Training
(p15.0) A particular form of HIIT is PHA (Peripheral Heart Action) training [76].PHA is a circuit training exercise that involves several stations that involve different muscles or muscle groups, following a well-defined pattern: the alternation between the exercises that involve the muscles located "above and below" the heart in such a way as to avoid passive breaks between stations.The HIIT session is repeated five times in the first 2 days of training and gradually increased in subsequent sessions according to the subject's heart rate, which is monitored with the heart rate monitor.In the PHA session the subjects perform 15 repetitions on each piece of equipment and then move on to the next station with active breaks until the completion of the circuit of training.Active breaks imply that the subjects train the lower limbs as soon as they finish the upper limbs and vice versa.This circuit training is performed four times, separated by 1 min of rest, and resistance is increased for the next exercise session if the subject is able to perform 15 full repetitions during the final set for each exercise.Subjects wear a heart rate monitor and maintain intensity at 55-60% of 1RM, which corresponds to approximately 60-80% of HRmax.
## (s16) Water Exercise
(p16.0) Compared to land-based exercise, aquatic exercise displays different advantages, including its effects on cardiovascular regulation because the blood flow to the lower limbs decreases due to the existence of hydrostatic pressure.This increases the redistribution of blood flow and the cardiac preload, thus increasing the stroke volume.Moreover, due to the height of the water, the pressure on systemic circulation increases, further affecting respiratory effort.These changes are helpful in increasing the elasticity and strength of the respiratory muscles, improving oxygen uptake [77].The resistance and heat dissipation effects of water are conducive to energy expenditure and improve the effects of exercise [77].Therefore, exercise in water could be considered an alternative protocol to land-based exercise.Such protocol could be started with a 5 min warm-up consisting of articular mobilization, followed by 30 min of easy swimming (alternating the various swimming styles-front crawl, breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly), 5 min of leg-only swimming and 5 min of arm-only swimming, 5 min of aquatic skills, and 5 min of cool-down.An alternative protocol, with head-out water immersion, may be used successfully and induce positive metabolic adaptations in patients with diabetes [78].

(p16.1) Exercise prescription must also consider patients' readiness to exercise, attitudes, and belief systems while positively encouraging decisions to exercise.Support can be provided through a team of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, lifestyle counsellors, and exercise consultants and even through health policy decision-making at the government and local levels.Moreover, exercise should be prescribed based on the type of diabetes, distinguishing between type 1 and type 2.
## (s17) Conclusions and Future Recommendations
(p17.0) The major challenge is to persuade diabetic people to practice PA and to follow dietary recommendations.Sedentary persons with disabilities are very resistant to changing their lifestyle; in particular, adult diabetic people are resistant to changing their habits, maybe because of this pathology, except for those who have complications.Successful interventions to promote long-term changes have used specific strategies to promote sustainable effects of interventions [79].Considering that drug-resistant diseases could become the leading cause of death by 2050, an intervention aiming at sustainable lifestyle change must, therefore, include components that facilitate the maintenance of PA levels and dietary changes over time.

(p17.1) It is well known that men and women of all ages and abilities can improve their quality of life through regular PA associated with well-designed dietary recommendations and nutrition therapy.Being physically active is one of the most important actions that people of all ages can take to improve their health.The regular practice of physical exercise fosters normal growth and development, makes people feel better, function better, sleep better, and reduces the risk of a large number of chronic diseases.Health benefits start immediately after exercising, and even short episodes of PA are beneficial.Evidence regarding the health benefits of regular PA is well established, and research continues to provide insight into what works to get people moving, both at the individual and community levels.Achieving the benefits of PA depends on our personal efforts to increase activity in ourselves, family, friends, patients, and colleagues.Action is also required at the school, workplace, and community levels.Future recommendations for elderly interventions should emphasize the importance of naturalistic or personally meaningful environments and designs that should induce a mismatch of supply and demand; they should have high task variability, fulfilling basic individual senior needs, but also be engaging to maximize long-term adherence to physical exercise and an active lifestyle.
