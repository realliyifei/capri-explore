(p9.0) The The exergy analysis for the PV panel involves similar terms as the exergy balance in equation (13). The inlet exergy rate absorbed from solar radiation, equation (15), and heat loss exergy rate, equation (18) are identical, observing that Ac is now the area of the PV cell, instead of the collector area.
