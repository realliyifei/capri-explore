## (s4) Mobility and Clustering of Au on Graphene
(p4.0) Srivastava et al. [92] performed density functional calculations to investigate the bonding properties of Au n (n = 1-5) clusters on perfect free-standing single-layer graphene.In synthesis, their results show that the Au n clusters are bonded to graphene through an anchor atom and that the geometries of the clusters on graphene are similar to their free-standing counterparts.Figure 3 shows, in particular, the results for the stable geometry configurations of the Au 1 , Au 2 , Au 3 , Au 4 , Au 5 on the graphene.According to these results: (a) the energetically stable site for the Au atom on graphene is atop to C atom (at an equilibrium distance of 2.82 Å), in agreement with the finding of Liu et al. [100]; (b) for n > 1, each of the Au n cluster is bonded to the graphene by one Au atom which is closer to the graphene and the overall geometry of the cluster remembers its freestanding configuration.Concerning the Au 5 cluster two different stable configurations are found, i.e., the last two rows in Figure 3.These two configurations differ for taking into in account or not van der Waals interaction: the last configuration for the Au 5 cluster (named Au 5 (P)) is obtained taking into in account the van der Waals interaction.The overall results of the calculations performed by Srivastava et al. are summarized in Table 2.This table reports, for each Au n cluster: h a which is the distance of the Au anchor atom of the cluster from the graphene plane; d ac which is the distance of the Au anchor atom from the nearest-neighbor C atom of the graphene layer; the binding energies BE 1 , BE 2 , BE 3 of the Au n clusters with the graphene, being these energies defined by BE 1

(p4.1) G −E Au_n with E G the energy of the free-standing graphene, E '  G the energy of the graphene after adsorbing the Au n cluster, E Au_n the energy of the isolated Au n cluster, E G+Aun the energy of the system formed by the free-standing graphene and the isolated Au n cluster, n the number of Au atoms in the cluster.With these definitions, BE 1 represents the cohesive energy of the cluster affected by the interaction with the graphene, BE 2 is the energy gained by the system in consequence of the addition of one more atom to the already existing cluster, BE 3 is the energy gained by the system resulting from the interaction of graphene and cluster.

(p4.2) In particular, analyzing the binding energies, the following conclusions can be drawn: the Au n cluster is bonded to the graphene by the Au anchor atom and the bonding energy is dependent both on h a and d ac .Furthermore, the small values of BE 3 are the signature of the weak bond between the Au n clusters and the graphene.This should favor high mobility of Au adatoms and Au n cluster on perfect free-standing graphene.However, this mobility is, also, determined by the diffusion barrier.To analyze this point, we discuss the theoretical findings of Amft et al. [93].They used density functional calculations to study the Au n (n = 1-4) mobility on free-standing single layer graphene and their clustering properties.In particular, they studied the mobility of the Au atoms (Au 1 ) and the mobility of the Au 2 , Au 3 , and Au 4 clusters finding that the diffusion barrier of all studied clusters ranges from 4 to 36 meV.On the other hand, they found that the Au n adsorption energy ranges from −0.1 to −0.59 eV.The diffusion barrier, therefore, results much lower than the adsorption energies.These results confirm the high mobility of the Au 1-4 clusters on graphene along the C-C bonds.The Au 4 cluster shows a peculiarity with respect to the other clusters: it can present two distinct structure, i.e., the diamond-shaped Au values for the adsorption energy and for the diffusion barrier of the Au 1-4 clusters, Amft et al. [93] conclude that the low diffusion barriers for the Au n clusters (with respect to the adsorption energy) suggest a high mobility of the clusters on the graphene also at low temperatures.So, the adsorbed Au n clusters can easily diffuse on the graphene and, upon merging, they form larger clusters to minimize the total energy of the system (since the Au-Au bonding energy is higher than the Au-C one).

(p4.3) Amft et al. [93] conclude that the low diffusion barriers for the Aun clusters (with respect to the adsorption energy) suggest a high mobility of the clusters on the graphene also at low temperatures.So, the adsorbed Aun clusters can easily diffuse on the graphene and, upon merging, they form larger clusters to minimize the total energy of the system (since the Au-Au bonding energy is higher than the Au-C one).Table 2.

## (s6) System
(p6.0) Semidey-Flecha et al. [99] used density functional theory calculations to investigate the adsorption and diffusion of Au adatom on the graphene moiré superstructure on Ru(0001).Their results can be synthesized as follows: (a) the FCC region on the graphene moiré is the most stable adsorption site for Au 1 ; (b) the diffusion barrier for Au 1 is determined to be 0.71 eV (much higher than the value of 15 meV evaluated by Amft et al. [93] for Au 1 on free-standing graphene).
## (s10) General Considerations
(p10.0) A set of experimental data on the growth of a range of metal NPs by vapor-phase depositions of metal atoms on graphene was reported by Zhou et al. [65].In this work, the authors deposited, by thermal evaporation, Pt, Rh, Pd, Co, and Au on a graphene moiré pattern on Ru(0001).Then they performed systematic scanning tunneling microscopy studies to analyze the growth mode of the resulting NPs as a function of the amount (in unity of monolayers, ML) of deposited material and as a function of the annealing temperature of a subsequent annealing process.The authors, in particular, tried to highlight the differences observed for the various metals: in fact, their experimental data show that Pt and Rh form small particles sited at fcc sites on graphene.Instead, in similar coverage conditions, Pd and Co form larger particles.Analyzing these results, the authors conclude that the metal-carbon bond strength and metal cohesive energy are the main parameters in determining the metal clusters formation process and the morphology of the clusters in the initial stages of growth.On the other hand, experimental data on the growth of Au show a further different behavior (Au forms a single-layer film on graphene) suggesting, in this case, that other factors affect the growth of the Au cluster.Figures 9-11 summarize some scanning tunneling microscopy analyses of various metals deposited on the graphene/Ru(0001) substrate, as reported by Zhou et al. [65].[98] with permission from the American Institute of Physics.
## (s12) General Considerations
(p12.0) A set of experimental data on the growth of a range of metal NPs by vapor-phase depositions of metal atoms on graphene was reported by Zhou et al. [65].In this work, the authors deposited, by thermal evaporation, Pt, Rh, Pd, Co, and Au on a graphene moiré pattern on Ru(0001).Then they performed systematic scanning tunneling microscopy studies to analyze the growth mode of the resulting NPs as a function of the amount (in unity of monolayers, ML) of deposited material and as a function of the annealing temperature of a subsequent annealing process.The authors, in particular, tried to highlight the differences observed for the various metals: in fact, their experimental data show that Pt and Rh form small particles sited at fcc sites on graphene.Instead, in similar coverage conditions, Pd and Co form larger particles.Analyzing these results, the authors conclude that the metal-carbon bond strength and metal cohesive energy are the main parameters in determining the metal clusters formation process and the morphology of the clusters in the initial stages of growth.On the other hand, experimental data on the growth of Au show a further different behavior (Au forms a single-layer film on graphene) suggesting, in this case, that other factors affect the growth of the Au cluster.Figures 9-11 summarize some scanning tunneling microscopy analyses of various metals deposited on the graphene/Ru(0001) substrate, as reported by Zhou et al. [65].In particular, Figure 9 reports Scanning Tunneling Microscopy images for Rh deposited at room-temperature on the graphene/Ru(0001) substrates and increasing the amount of deposited Rh (from 0.05 to 0.80 ML).From a quantitative point of view, using these analyses, the authors inferred that until 0.6 ML the average Rh clusters size increases by increasing the amount of deposited Rh: the Rh cluster size and height significantly increase when the amount of deposited material increase but, correspondently, a much lower increases of the particles density is observed.Similar is the behavior of Pt: for a coverage of 0.1 ML, 2 nm-diameter highly dispersed Pt particles are formed at fcc sites; for a coverage of 1 ML, instead, 5 nm-diameter Pt particles are formed and characterized by a narrow size distribution.Figure 10 shows other Scanning Tunneling Microscopy images: (a) and (b) report images of 0.1 and 0.4 ML Pd deposited on graphene/Ru(0001), respectively.In this case, at a coverage of 0.1 ML, 8-14 nm-diameter three-dimensional Pd particles are formed at fcc sites and with a lower surface density compared to Rh and Pt.(c) and (d) report images of 0.2 and 0.4 ML of Co on graphene/Ru(0001).At a coverage of 0.2 ML, 10 nm-diameter three-dimensional Co particles are formed, while, at a coverage of 0.4 ML, 12 nm-diameter clusters are observed.(e) and (f) report images of 0.2 and 0.6 ML Au on graphene/Ru(0001).At 0.2 ML, small two-dimensional Au particles are formed at fcc sites.However, differently from the previous metals, increasing the coverage (0.6 ML, for example), Au forms a film of NPs covering the graphene moiré pattern.Finally, Figure 11 serves as an example to analyze the thermal stability of the nucleated NPs: it presents images of the Rh NPs on the graphene/Ru(0001) substrate after annealing process from 600 to 1100 K for 600 s.These images show that no significant change can be recognized in the Rh NPs below 900 K. Instead, a NPs coalescence process starts at ∼900 K as indicated by the decreased cluster density and larger dimensions.The NPs coalescence process is more evident after the annealing of the sample at 1100 K.
## (s19) The Dewetting Process
(p19.0) Thin metal films deposited on a non-metal susbstrate are, generally, thermodinamically unstable.Then, if enough energy is furnished to the film so that atomic diffusion occurs, the system tends to minimize the total surface and interface energy: the result is the break-up of the film and the formation of spherical metal particles minimizing the total exposed surface [123][124][125][126][127][128][129][130].The dewetting process starts in structural defects of the films: these are the locations in which holes in the film, reaching the underlaying substrate, nucleate.The holes grow with time and two or more holes join (i.e.coalesce) with the result of leaving the film in filaments structures.These filaments, then, being unstable, decay in spherical particles by a Raileigh-like instability process.The overall result is, so, the formation of an array of metal NPs.In a certain range, the mean size and mean spacing of the formed NPs can be controlled by the thickness of the deposited film or by the characteristic parameters of the process inducing the dewetting phenomenon such as the temperature or time of an annealing process [123][124][125][126][127][128][129][130].The energetic budget needed to start the dewetting process of the film (i.e., to activate the atomic diffusion) can be furnished to the film by standard thermal annealing, or, alternatively, by laser, ion, electron beam irradiations.In addition, for metal films, the dewetting process can occur both in the solid or molten state.

(p19.1) Nowadays, in the nanotechnology working framework, the dewetting of ultrathin metal films on surface is routinely exploited to produce arrays of metal NPs on surfaces in view of technological applications [123][124][125][126][127][128][129][130] such as those based on plasmonic effects (Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering), magnetic recording, nanoelectronics, catalysis, etc.

(p19.2) Due to these peculiarities, the dewetting process was, also, exploited to produce, in a controlled way, metal NPs on graphene surface from deposited thin metal films.This approach is effective in the production of shape-and size-selected metal NPs on the graphene surface for some interesting applications involving, for example, the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering of the NPs as modified by the interaction with the graphene layer.
## (s20) Dewetting of Au Films on Graphene
(p20.0) Zhou et al. [68] investigated the possibility to produce and to control size, density and shape of Au NPs on graphene by the dewetting process of deposited thin films.So, after depositing the Au films, they performed annealing processes to induce the evolution of the films in NPs and, interestingly, they found that the shape, size and density of the obtained NPs can be controlled by the number of graphene layers and by the annealing temperature.

(p20.1) First of all, the authors [68] transferred n-layer graphene on a SiO 2 substrate after having obtained the n-layer graphene by standard mechanical exfoliation.The number of the graphene layers on the SiO 2 substrate was determined by crossing optical microscope and micro-Raman spectroscopy.After depositing (by thermal evaporation) thin Au films onto the n-layers graphene and onto the SiO 2 surface as reference, annealing processes were performed in the 600 • C-900 • C temperature range for 2 h.Then the authors used Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis to study shape, size and density of the observed NPs as a function of the annealing temperature, thickness of the starting deposited Au film, number of graphene layers supporting the Au film.The following general considerations are drawn by the authors on the basis of the results of these analysis: firstly, if the annealing temperature is in the 600-700 • C range, then the Au film on n-layer graphenes can be tuned into hexagon-shaped Au NPs.

(p20.2) Secondly, annealing at 800 • C produces, instead, coexistence of hexagonal and triangular Au NPs on graphenes.Thirdly, annealing at 900 • C produces irregular-shaped Au NPs on graphenes.Moreover, the density and size of the formed Au NPs on n-layer graphenes are strictly dependent on the number n of graphene layers.In particular, increasing n the NPs mean size increases and the NPs surface density decreases.As an example, Figure 23   Another aspect is that the Au film dewetting process on the n-layer graphenes is thickness-dependent.The influence of the Au film thickness on the shape of the obtained Au NPs is described by the images in Figure 24: it presents Scanning Electron Microscopy images of 1 nm, 1.5 nm and 2 nm thick Au films on n-layers graphene and annealed at 600 °C for 2 h.With the increase of the Au film thickness, the effect of the graphene layers number on the shape of Au NPs becomes more and more weak.When film thickness is below 2.0 nm, after thermal annealing at 600 or 700 °C, almost all the Au NPs show hexagonal shape.Whereas for 5.0 nm Au film or more, although hexagon-shaped Au NPs still exist after annealing at 600 °C, the Au NPs are not well faceted.Another aspect is that the Au film dewetting process on the n-layer graphenes is thickness-dependent.The influence of the Au film thickness on the shape of the obtained Au NPs is described by the images in Figure 24: it presents Scanning Electron Microscopy images of 1 nm, 1.5 nm and 2 nm thick Au films on n-layers graphene and annealed at 600 • C for 2 h.With the increase of the Au film thickness, the effect of the graphene layers number on the shape of Au NPs becomes more and more weak.When film thickness is below 2.0 nm, after thermal annealing at 600 or 700 • C, almost all the Au NPs show hexagonal shape.Whereas for 5.0 nm Au film or more, although hexagon-shaped Au NPs still exist after annealing at 600 • C, the Au NPs are not well faceted.All these experimental data highlight the key role of the graphene layers number in determining size, density and shape of the Au NPs clearly indicates that n establishes the interaction strength between the graphene and the Au atoms affecting, as a consequence, the Au diffusivity and the final Au NPs morphology.To infer information on the parameters governing the Au NPs shape, size and density evolution, the authors [68] take into considerations the following main factors: the Au adatoms are weakly bonded with C atoms on graphene surface (interpreted as a physical adsorption rather than a chemical bonding) and the strength of this bonding is largely influenced by the number of graphene layers [101][102][103][104]. So, with the increase of layer number the inter-layer interaction strength decreases and, consequently, the interaction between Au adatoms and n-layer graphene becomes much weaker, resulting in the thickness-dependent particle size and density of Au NPs on graphenes by the different Au mobility on the graphenes.The surface diffusion of metal adatoms on graphenes can be described by these two equations: D∝exp(−Ea,n/kT) and N∝(1/D) 1/3 , being D the adatoms surface diffusion, N the NPs surface density, Ea,n the activation energy for the adatoms surface diffusion on n-layers graphene.Combining these two equations, the relation N∝exp (Ea,n/3kT) is obtained.So, Zhou et al. [68] conclude that the decrease of surface diffusion barrier with increasing the number of graphene layers n explains the observed experimental data: the diffusion coefficient establishing the diffusion length, determines the joining probability for the adatoms.Therefore, concerning the thermal annealing post-growth processes, it establishes the size and density of the formed NPs by the competition between nucleation and growth phenomena [69].Therefore, different surface diffusion coefficients (by different activation energies Ea,n) of the Au adatoms on the n-layers graphene can result in n-dependent morphologies, sizes, and density of the Au NPs on n-layer graphenes.To support quantitatively these considerations, in a further study, Zhou et al. [69], proceeded to the quantification of the size and density of the Au NPs after the thermal treatment.In particular, the authors proceeded to the following experiment: after depositing a Au film on the SiO2 substrate, on 1-layer, 2-layers, 3-layers, and 4-layers graphene supported on the SiO2 substrate, the authors performed a 1260 °C-30 s annealing to obtain round-shaped Au NPs All these experimental data highlight the key role of the graphene layers number in determining size, density and shape of the Au NPs clearly indicates that n establishes the interaction strength between the graphene and the Au atoms affecting, as a consequence, the Au diffusivity and the final Au NPs morphology.To infer information on the parameters governing the Au NPs shape, size and density evolution, the authors [68] take into considerations the following main factors: the Au adatoms are weakly bonded with C atoms on graphene surface (interpreted as a physical adsorption rather than a chemical bonding) and the strength of this bonding is largely influenced by the number of graphene layers [101][102][103][104]. So, with the increase of layer number the inter-layer interaction strength decreases and, consequently, the interaction between Au adatoms and n-layer graphene becomes much weaker, resulting in the thickness-dependent particle size and density of Au NPs on graphenes by the different Au mobility on the graphenes.The surface diffusion of metal adatoms on graphenes can be described by these two equations: D∝exp(−E a,n /kT) and N∝(1/D) 1/3 , being D the adatoms surface diffusion, N the NPs surface density, E a,n the activation energy for the adatoms surface diffusion on n-layers graphene.Combining these two equations, the relation N∝exp (E a,n /3kT) is obtained.So, Zhou et al. [68] conclude that the decrease of surface diffusion barrier with increasing the number of graphene layers n explains the observed experimental data: the diffusion coefficient establishing the diffusion length, determines the joining probability for the adatoms.Therefore, concerning the thermal annealing post-growth processes, it establishes the size and density of the formed NPs by the competition between nucleation and growth phenomena [69].Therefore, different surface diffusion coefficients (by different activation energies E a,n ) of the Au adatoms on the n-layers graphene can result in n-dependent morphologies, sizes, and density of the Au NPs on n-layer graphenes.To support quantitatively these considerations, in a further study, Zhou et al. [69], proceeded to the quantification of the size and density of the Au NPs after the thermal treatment.In particular, the authors proceeded to the following experiment: after depositing a Au film on the SiO 2 substrate, on 1-layer, 2-layers, 3-layers, and 4-layers graphene supported on the SiO 2 substrate, the authors performed a 1260 • C-30 s annealing to obtain round-shaped Au NPs as shown in Figure 25a but with a different size and surface density N of the NPs on the basis of the number n of the graphene layers.As reported in Figure 25b the authors quantified the size and the surface density of the Au NPs as a function of n.In particular, N versus n was analyzed by the N∝exp (Ea,n/3kT) relation.Although it is difficult to obtain the absolute value of barriers due to the lack of the pre-exponential factor, the authors were able in evaluate the barrier difference between n-layer graphene by the density ratios: Ea,1 − Ea,2 = 3kTln(N1/N2) = 504 ± 44 meV, and similarly, Ea,2 − Ea,3 = 291 ± 31 meV, Ea,3 − Ea,4 = 242 ± 22 meV.
## (s21) Dewetting of Ag Films on Graphene
(p21.0) Zhou et al. [71] extended their work to the dewetting of Ag films on n-layers graphene.In this case, in addition, a detailed study of the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering of the Ag NPs was also conducted.The authors deposited Ag films onto n-layer graphenes (supported on SiO2).In this case experiments were conducted maintaining the substrate temperature at 298, 333, and 373 K during the Ag depositions and Scanning Electron Microscopy images were used to study the morphology, size, surface density of the produced Ag NPs on the graphene layers as a function of the substrate temperature.In addition, also in this case, a strict dependence of the Ag NPs morphology, size and surface density on the number of graphene layers n supporting the Ag film was found.Similarly to Au, this was attributed by the authors to the changes in the surface diffusion coefficient of Ag on n-layer graphenes at different temperatures (the substrate temperature during Ag depositions, in this case).In addition, the authors observed that Raman scattering of n-layer graphenes is greatly enhanced by the presence of the Ag NPs.In particular, they found that the enhancement factors depend on the number n of graphene layers.Monolayer graphene has the largest enhancement factors, and the enhancement factors decrease with layer number increasing.Obviously, this is due to the specific structural characteristics of the Ag NPs as determined by n.

(p21.1) In particular, the authors [71] thermally evaporated 2 or 5 nm Ag films onto n-layer graphenes supported on the 300 nm-thick SiO2 layer grown on Si.During the Ag depositions, the substrate is kept at 298 K, or 333 K, or 373 K. On the basis of the substrate temperature and number of graphene layers, different shapes, sizes, and surface density are obtained for the resulting Ag NPs.As an example, Figure 26 reports Scanning Electron Microscopy images of 5 nm-thick Ag film deposited on SiO2, on 1-layer, and 2-layers graphene with the substrate kept at 298 K (a-b), 333 K (c-d), 373 K (e-f).The differences in the formed Ag NPs are just evident at 333K: on one layer graphene, the density of Ag NPs larger than that on bilayer graphene, the NPs spacing is lower, but the NPs diameter are similar in the two samples.At 373 K these differences are enhanced: the Ad NPs present very different sizes, spacing, and surface density as a function of the number n of the As reported in Figure 25b the authors quantified the size and the surface density of the Au NPs as a function of n.In particular, N versus n was analyzed by the N∝exp (E a,n /3kT) relation.Although it is difficult to obtain the absolute value of barriers due to the lack of the pre-exponential factor, the authors were able in evaluate the barrier difference between n-layer graphene by the density ratios: E a,1 − E a,2 = 3kTln(N 1 /N 2 ) = 504 ± 44 meV, and similarly, E a,2 − E a,3 = 291 ± 31 meV, E a,3 − E a,4 = 242 ± 22 meV.
## (s22) Dewetting of Ag Films on Graphene
(p22.0) Zhou et al. [71] extended their work to the dewetting of Ag films on n-layers graphene.In this case, in addition, a detailed study of the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering of the Ag NPs was also conducted.The authors deposited Ag films onto n-layer graphenes (supported on SiO 2 ).In this case experiments were conducted maintaining the substrate temperature at 298, 333, and 373 K during the Ag depositions and Scanning Electron Microscopy images were used to study the morphology, size, surface density of the produced Ag NPs on the graphene layers as a function of the substrate temperature.In addition, also in this case, a strict dependence of the Ag NPs morphology, size and surface density on the number of graphene layers n supporting the Ag film was found.Similarly to Au, this was attributed by the authors to the changes in the surface diffusion coefficient of Ag on n-layer graphenes at different temperatures (the substrate temperature during Ag depositions, in this case).In addition, the authors observed that Raman scattering of n-layer graphenes is greatly enhanced by the presence of the Ag NPs.In particular, they found that the enhancement factors depend on the number n of graphene layers.Monolayer graphene has the largest enhancement factors, and the enhancement factors decrease with layer number increasing.Obviously, this is due to the specific structural characteristics of the Ag NPs as determined by n.

(p22.1) In particular, the authors [71] thermally evaporated 2 or 5 nm Ag films onto n-layer graphenes supported on the 300 nm-thick SiO 2 layer grown on Si.During the Ag depositions, the substrate is kept at 298 K, or 333 K, or 373 K. On the basis of the substrate temperature and number of graphene layers, different shapes, sizes, and surface density are obtained for the resulting Ag NPs.As an example, Figure 26 reports Scanning Electron Microscopy images of 5 nm-thick Ag film deposited on SiO 2 , on 1-layer, and 2-layers graphene with the substrate kept at 298 K (a-b), 333 K (c-d), 373 K (e-f).The differences in the formed Ag NPs are just evident at 333 K: on one layer graphene, the density of Ag NPs larger than that on bilayer graphene, the NPs spacing is lower, but the NPs diameter are similar in the two samples.At 373 K these differences are enhanced: the Ad NPs present very different sizes, spacing, and surface density as a function of the number n of the graphene layers.For example, the NPs on monolayer graphene are much smaller than those on bilayer graphene.

(p22.2) Then, using Raman spectroscopy, the authors found different Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) effects of Ag on n-layer graphenes [71], as summarized in Figures 27 and 28.In Figure 27, the authors compare the enhancement effects of 2 and 5 nm Ag deposited at 298 K on the graphene samples.Raman spectra of n-layer graphenes with 5 nm are enhanced with respect to 2 nm Ag (and pristine graphene): the G and 2D bands are more intense.This can be attribute to the fact that the deposition of the 5 nm Ag leads to the formation of NPs with higher surface density and lower spacing with the result to increase the SERS hot spots number per unit area.As a consequence, the increased density of hot spots causes a higher electric filed localization and, so, higher enhancement factors.To further analyze the Raman scattering properties of the graphene supporting the Ag NPs, the authors measured the Raman spectra of n-layer graphenes supporting NPs obtained by the deposition of 5 nm-thick Ag maintaining the substrate at 298, 333, and 373 K, see Figure 28.A higher SERS enhancement factor is obtained from graphene covered by Ag NPs obtained by depositing 5 nm Ag maintaining the substrate at 333 K than at 298 K: in fact, at 333 K larger Ag NPs are obtained with the same spacing of those obtained at 298 K.However, when the 5 nm Ag film is deposited maintaining the substrate at 373 K, the particles are larger but, also, the NPs spacing increases, resulting in a decrease of the enhancement factor.

(p22.3) Crystals 2017, 7, 219 29 of 40 graphene layers.For example, the NPs on monolayer graphene are much smaller than those on bilayer graphene.Then, using Raman spectroscopy, the authors found different Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) effects of Ag on n-layer graphenes [71], as summarized in Figures 27 and 28.In Figure 27, the authors compare the enhancement effects of 2 and 5 nm Ag deposited at 298 K on the graphene samples.Raman spectra of n-layer graphenes with 5 nm are enhanced with respect to 2 nm Ag (and pristine graphene): the G and 2D bands are more intense.This can be attribute to the fact that the deposition of the 5 nm Ag leads to the formation of NPs with higher surface density and lower spacing with the result to increase the SERS hot spots number per unit area.As a consequence, the increased density of hot spots causes a higher electric filed localization and, so, higher enhancement factors.To further analyze the Raman scattering properties of the graphene supporting the Ag NPs, the authors measured the Raman spectra of n-layer graphenes supporting NPs obtained by the deposition of 5 nm-thick Ag maintaining the substrate at 298, 333, and 373 K, see Figure 28.A higher SERS enhancement factor is obtained from graphene covered by Ag NPs obtained by depositing 5 nm Ag maintaining the substrate at 333 K than at 298 K: in fact, at 333 K larger Ag NPs are obtained with the same spacing of those obtained at 298 K.However, when the 5 nm Ag film is deposited maintaining the substrate at 373 K, the particles are larger but, also, the NPs spacing increases, resulting in a decrease of the enhancement factor.
## (s29) Conclusions, Open Points, and Perspectives
(p29.0) The next developments for metal NPs/Graphene nanocomposites are conditioned to the atomic scale control of the fabrication of the metal NPs and optimization of the techniques for reaching the wide-range control of the nano-architecture.Nowadays, several properties and applications of metal NPs/Graphene nanocomposites have been explored.As a non-exhaustive synthesis, Table 5 reports some examples of the properties and technological applications for several metal NPs/graphene systems, ranging from sensing and biosensing to nanoelectronics, catalysis and solar devices [135][136][137][138][139].

(p29.1) Surely, new insights and perspectives are related to the nanoscale control of the spatial organization and shape of the NPs.In this sense, the use of techniques to self-assembly the metal NPs on the graphene in spatially ordered arrays will be the key approach.So, in general, the key step towards real engineering of the metal NPs/graphene nanocomposites is the development of methodologies to produce complex nanoscale architectures.Towards this end, the vapor-deposition based techniques can open new perspectives.

(p29.2) Fine control of the morphology of the metal NPs on graphene is also a very interesting challenge.By the possibility to grow a range of geometric shapes at the nanoscale, the production of complex-morphology metal NPs on graphene is an interesting area of research, especially with regard to the resulting plasmonic properties.

(p29.3) Another interesting point concerns the use of new metal NPs (with specific functionalities) in the mixing with graphene.Probably, alloys of metals and core-shell type NPs (Ag/Au, Au/Pd, Pd/Pt, Pt/Rh, Pt/Ru) could be very useful tool, particularly in information storage and biomedicine applications.

(p29.4) A recent field of investigation for metal NPs/graphene nanocomposites is that related to photocatalysis [140].Towards this application, however, the key requirement is the development of procedures allowing the preparation of composites which are biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-toxic and assuring, also, the control of the NPs size and shape.Notably, the long-term efficiencies of the metal NPs/graphene in real photocatalytic applications composites represents an important practical issue to be resolved.In the renewable energy production field, metal NPs-graphene composites are attracting great interest.The graphene can be used in a solar cell as a transparent conductive electrode and the metal NPs as plasmonic scattering elements [40,135,137].Significant results have been already achieved.However, in addition solar cell devices, thermoelectric devices are attracting much attention [141].

(p29.5) Towards these perspectives and developments, the physical vapor deposition processes-based techniques to produce the metal NPs-graphene composites will acquire, surely, more and more importance due to their simplicity, versatility, and high throughput.For these reasons such techniques are, in perspective, the main candidates to be implemented in the industry market for the large-area production and commercialization of functional devices based on the metal NPs-graphene composites.Toward this end, the present paper highlighted the key importance of the understanding and controlling the microscopic thermodynamics and kinetics mechanisms involved in the nucleation and growth processes of atoms on/in graphene.So, crossed theoretical and experimental studies characterizing these mechanisms and quantifying the involved parameters such as adsorption energies, activation energies, diffusion constants, etc. will acquire more and more importance.In fact, the fine control of these parameters will allow the superior control on the morphological/structural characteristics of the composites and so, as a consequence, the tuning of all the physico-chemical properties of the composites for high-efficiency functional applications.
