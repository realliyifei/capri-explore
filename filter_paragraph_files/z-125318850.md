## (s0) Causes And Remedies In Casting
(p0.0) In this section we study the different types of defects in casting, and there origin and remedies. The defects may arise due to the defects in one or more of the following factors; [2] [3] Design of casting and pattern 1. Moulding sand and design of mould and core. 2. Metal composition. 3. Melting and pouring. 4. Gating system.

(p0.1) The most commonly encountered defects in the sand mould castings are: 1. Blow-It is a largely wellrounded cavity produced by the gases which displace the molten metal at the cope surface of a casting. Generally occurs on the convex casting surface. Excessive moisture content in the mould ii.
