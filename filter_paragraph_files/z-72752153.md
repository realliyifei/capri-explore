(p7.0) The most important clinical application of the ceruloplasmin test is in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, where typically, concentrations of ceruloplasmin are reduced and concentration of dialyzable copper are increased. Unless treated with copper chelators, the disease is always progressive and fatal 20 . Prompt diagnosis is important since the treatment takes 3-6 months to have the Excessive therapeutic zinc may lead to block of intenstinal absorption of copper and a copper deficiency syndrome characterized by hypochromic microcytic anemia with leukopenia/ neutropenia and zero level of ceruloplasmin. A prolonged period of time may be required to eliminate the excess zinc, overcome the block of intestinal copper absorption and obtain increase in serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels 22 .

(p7.1) • Ceruloplasmin is low in Menkes kiny hair syndrome (in Menkes syndrome the defect is secondary to poor absorption and utilization of dietary copper) and with protein loss such as the nephrotic syndromes, malabsorption and with some cases of advanced liver disease in which decreases of serum proteins have occurred 23 .

(p8.0) Ceruloplasmin is high in a variety of neoplastic and inflammatory states since it behaves as an acute phase reactant, although levels rise more slowly than do those of other acute phase reactants 24 . Increases are described in carcinomas, leukemia's, Hodgkin disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. High levels occur in pregnancy, with estrogens and with oral contraceptive use when the agent contains estrogen as well as progesterone. It is also increased in copper intoxication 25 .
