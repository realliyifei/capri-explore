## (s1) COAGULATION AND SEPSIS
(p1.0) Historically, two pathways describe the initiation of coagulation (figure 1). 10 The intrinsic or contact pathway begins with the activation of coagulation factor XII; the extrinsic or tissue factor (TF) pathway begins with TF release usually after endothelial injury. In the common final pathway of coagulation, activated factors V and X, calcium, and prothrombin unite to generate thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin. In turn, fibrin activates platelets, which crosslink to augment clot strength. Altogether, these pathways constitute the 'coagulation cascade', and form the basis of hemostasis.
