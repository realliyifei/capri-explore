## (s2) Removable Dentures
(p2.0) Bacteria are able to form a biofilm on the surface of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [10]-the main material used in the production of removable dentures. The ability to colonize and create biofilm on the surfaces of prostheses allows bacteria to use this additional niche for growth in the presence of a specific protective environment, which makes it difficult to remove them; hence, in cases of poor oral hygiene, prostheses can serve as a reservoir and cause persistent halitosis [10].
## (s6) Treatment in Prosthetic Patients
(p6.0) The effectiveness of agents commonly used for cleaning and improving the retention of dentures in reducing halitosis was tested. A commercial cleaning agent based on sodium perborate in the form of tablets, when the prosthesis was immersed in it once a day for 5 min, had no effect on the microorganisms of the prosthesis biofilm, and did not reduce the levels of volatile sulfur compounds [27]. Some denture adhesives containing sodiummagnesium-zinc and calcium-zinc copolymers such as PVM/MA, or lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, and lactoferrin, can inhibit microorganisms associated with halitosis [28].
## (s7) Other Supplementary Methods
(p7.0) Due to the fact that the main causative factor of intra-oral halitosis is dysbiosis in the composition of the commensal microbiota of the oral cavity, another method of treating halitosis is the use of probiotics [36,37]. Streptococcus salivarius is a non-pathogenic and dominant species that is an early colonizer of the oral cavity, and is one of the most important and most often isolated bacteria from people without halitosis [36][37][38][39][40][41]. Clinical studies are promising and show that the antimicrobial mouthwash containing Streptococcus salivarius K12 significantly reduced the number of volatile-sulfur-compound-producing bacteria [36]. In another study, Streptococcus salivarius K12 lozenges were used, and measurement of volatile sulfur compounds after their use also showed a significant improvement in most subjects.
