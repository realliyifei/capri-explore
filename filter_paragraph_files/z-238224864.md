## (s10) Conclusion
(p10.0) There are many pieces of evidence behind each of the proposed mechanisms of the Brugada syndrome as many diseases develop and occur through multiple mechanisms. As discussed above, while there is evidence to support both potential hypotheses, the most compelling evidence comes from studies involving human studies of the heart and is in support of the repolarization hypothesis. Models with ischemia are based on the depolarization models, but ischemia does not contribute directly to the syndrome . Models for the depolarization hypothesis also demonstrate the repolarization hypothesis instead. Mutations to the Na + , K + and Ca 2+ channels and arrhythmia occur in a way that is consistent with the repolarization hypothesis. Alterations to the Na + channels in the experiments do not help in supporting the depolarization hypothesis .

(p10.1) When the Ito gradient removed, the Brugada syndrome's mechanisms will be blocked, elevating the STsegment and the disappearance of late potentials and inhibition of INa by quinidine show point to the effects of Quinidine, a medical antiarrhythmic drug that blocks Ito, helps prevent reduced arrhythmias in patients (Meregalli et al., 2005;Wilde et al., 2010). Quinidine can be used to treat the repolarization heterogeneity.
