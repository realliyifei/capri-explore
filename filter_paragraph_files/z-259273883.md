## (s0) | INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Deprescribing is defined as the act of reducing the dose or stopping medications that are deemed inappropriate in order to reduce polypharmacy and improve health outcomes. 1As older adults are likely to take several medications concurrently, deprescribing is a relevant intervention to optimize their medication use.However, the lack of robust evidence is often identified as a barrier to the implementation of deprescribing in primary care. 2 Therefore, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of deprescribing studies can play a significant role in filling the knowledge gap and facilitating the integration of this practice into healthcare.
## (s2) | Data source and data extraction
(p2.0) We appraised the 12 randomized controlled trials that evaluated the impact of medication reviews on mortality, as identified by Bloomfield et al., 11 who conducted a literature search from January 1990 to February 2019.We extracted all basic information related to the study protocol (design, setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, follow-up and funding), the intervention (description of intervention in the exposed and non-exposed groups, including the definition of deprescription and tools used), the data sources that were used, the outcomes studied, the socio-demographic characteristics of the population and the statistical analyses performed.We extracted data on the medications used and the medications that were deprescribed.We also recorded whether mortality was the primary outcome.Data extraction was conducted by two independent reviewers (MG and CL) and reviewed by a third reviewer (CS) for accuracy.Our extracted data was compared to the data extracted by Bloomfield et al. 11

(p4.0) The main observations regarding the medications that were deprescribed and the methodology used in the 12 studies are summarized in Table 1.Appendix 1 provides detailed data extracted from the studies.To acknowledge Bloomfield et al.'s work 11 and T A B L E 1 Summary data on deprescribed medications and mortality measures in the 12 randomized controlled trials.
## (s18) Limitations in methodology to assess mortality
(p18.0) • Very few baseline characteristics provided at baseline, difficult to appraise group comparability at baseline, and no adjustment made: potential confounding bias for mortality visualize potential discrepancies in extraction/addition, we retained the original data extracted from the authors of the meta-analysis and marked our additions and changes in colour.

(p18.1) Of the studies reviewed, only one 24 reported a statistically significant lower proportion of deaths in the intervention group compared to the control group (6/136 vs. 14/130, p = 0.049 with a chi-square test).
## (s19) | Data on medication deprescribed
(p19.0) The interventions were not always successful in reducing the pharmacological burden or improving its quality.In fact, in five studies, there was no difference in medication use between the exposed and non-exposed groups. 24,27,28,33,34In one study, 35 the number of medications used increased (although the increase was more pronounced among the control group), and in one study, 32 it was not possible to conclude about medication use.As a result, less than half of the articles (5/12, 41%) 25,26,[29][30][31] reported a positive impact in the intervention group with regards to pharmacotherapy.This was reflected in a reduction in the total number of medications, 31 the number of Fall-Risk-Increasing-Drugs (FRIDs) medications, 25 the number of potentially inappropriate medications 26,30 or the number of drug-related problems. 29However, most studies provided minimal information on the medication deprescribed.For instance, specific groups of potentially inappropriate medications were not clearly described, and only four studies presented the classes of medications that were reduced or changed (stopped/substituted/started or dose changed), such as vitamins and minerals, antihypertensive, sedative or gastro-intestinal agents. 25,26,30,34Therefore, no specific conclusions could be drawn about the medications that were deprescribed in the studies.

(p19.1) Extracting information on deprescribed medications was a challenge, as many interventions included actions beyond deprescribing.Only two trials primarily focused on reducing the number of medications, specifically targeting medications on the FRIDs list 25 and anticholinergic/sedative medications to reduce the drug burden index (DBI). 34In the other studies, medication reviews took place as part of larger pharmaceutical care interventions, which involved not only stopping medications but also
## (s20) | Methodology aspects
(p20.0) No study was designed to investigate mortality as the main outcome.Only four studies included mortality as a secondary or safety outcome. 26,31,32,34Therefore, the studies were not designed to be adequately powered to detect clinically significant differences between the groups regarding mortality, and the number of events was low.In all eight other trials, mortality was only reported descriptively (often in the flowchart without additional information) and without measures of association-let alone adjustment for confounding factors.As a result, mortality data were most often provided similarly to data on people lost to follow-up or those who withdrew consent.The individuals who died were excluded from the medication analysis, except in the study by Hanlon et al., which included the data using the last information caried forward method. 28Baseline characteristics of those who died, the timing of their death in relation to the intervention, medication use patterns or other details relevant for appreciating the association between the intervention and mortality were absent from most trials.Nonetheless, Campins et al. reported that deaths in the intervention group were not related to medication changes in their study. 26verall, the studies included relatively small samples and had short follow-up periods.The total number of randomized participants varied between 25 27 and 1188, 35 with five studies having total sample sizes of ≤150. 27,29,31,33,34Follow-up was less than 1 year in three studies (5 weeks, 27 3 months, 34 6 months 29,31 ), 1 year in seven studies [24][25][26]28,30,33,35 and 2 years in one study. 32 This shot follow-up makes it difficult to accurately assess mortality risk. Futhermore, since the studies were not specifically designed to measure mortality, important confounding factors, such as frailty, cognitive status, autonomy and level of dependency, were not thoroughly evaluated.Due to the small sample sizes, there is a high risk of an imbalanced distribution of these factors between the intervention and control groups at randomization-a phenomenon that was observed with other variables, albeit limited.26,28,30,33,34 In the study by Lampela et al., 30 17 deaths occurred in the intervention group and 38 in the control group before the start of the intervention/ equivalent evaluation, which illustrates that mortality risk could have been imbalanced between groups.
## (s21) | Aspects of the meta-analysis
(p21.0) Several deaths that were included in the two trials with the highest weight 30,35 occurred before the intervention.Additionally, in the trial with the largest weight, 30 the number of deaths also included individuals in institutional care and not just those living in the community, as was the objective of the meta-analysis.These situations may have artificially favoured better survival in the deprescribing group.

(p21.1) Crude proportions were used to compute the overall measure of association between deprescribing and mortality in the meta-analysis.Despite being a customary practice for meta-analyses with clinical trial data, the studies included had certain limitations that made such analysis challenging.All of the trials presented characteristics that raise concerns regarding the association between deprescribing and mortality, based on the core difficulty in assessing the relationship between exposure and outcome, the lack of adjustment for potential confounders and the very short follow-up time.The fact that the value of I 2 was 0 should not be considered reassuring, as it only reveals that between-study heterogeneity is not beyond what would be expected by chance alone.In reality, there was heterogeneity in other aspects of the trials, including the type of population involved, the medications studied and the deprescribing interventions performed.
