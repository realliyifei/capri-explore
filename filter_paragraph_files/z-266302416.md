## (s3) Prognosis Based on Histologic Subtype
(p3.0) The identification of distinct histologic or molecular subtypes is only relevant if such subtypes define patient subsets with unique prognosis or response to therapy.Early publications suggested that histology might provide such a prognostic biomarker.In 2013, Chang et al. analyzed 72 resected ampullary adenocarcinoma patients.The authors observed improved median survival associated with INT tumor type (115.5 months vs. PB: 16 months; p < 0.001) [13].In an independent study cohort of 95 ampullary adenocarcinomas, INT subtype tumors evidenced improved median survival compared to PB subtype tumors (98 months vs. 25 months, p < 0.001) [27].Similar findings have been confirmed in at least three additional studies [28][29][30].
