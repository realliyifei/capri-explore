## (s3) Pulp and Paper Mill Industry
(p3.0) Numerous literatures on sustainability to various types of industries including the pulp and paper mill industry is evident over the years. This industry has been receiving widespread attention due to its high-energy consumption [23]. The pulp and paper mill industry generate different pollutants that depend on the type of pulping process [8]. Paper production includes three (3) major activities: pulp making, paper formation, and finishing. During the pulp making and paper formation process, coatings and fillers are added to the pulp that converts it into paper. This process requires an intensive resource and energy that results to huge emission of GHGs, water effluents, and other pollutants [24]. Various researches on sustainability methods include generating environment-friendly management strategies [6], treatment processes [8], and integration of inventory models [2].
