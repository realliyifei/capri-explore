## (s9) Research on rats
(p9.0) Insulin-producing cells and mesenchymal stroma cells are protective against cognitive impairment in the implant site of diabetic rats (Wartchow, 2020). Stimulation threshold has an ef icient design in retinal and visual and cortical implants in rats (Xie et al., 2019). The response of visual cortical neurons in the mouse, intraocular and extraocular are stimulated by electrical signals in the retina (Ryu and Fried, 2018). The results indicate a therapeutic activity towards the sustainment of the penile erection within the presence of an extract in aged rats (Seppan et al., 2018).
