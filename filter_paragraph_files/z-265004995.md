## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Throughout history, natural remedies made from herbs have been used to treat various physiological disorders, and are generally considered safe.According to the World Health Organization, around 80% of the global population relies on herbal-based products to treat different ailments. 1he global market for herbal formulations is currently estimated at $1.5 billion and it is expected to expand significantly as demand for natural remedies used for preventing and curing different diseases increases. 1rbs/herbal products are vital sources of novel pharmaceuticals because they contain a significant amount of secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, lignans, quinones, catechols, coumarins, polyphenols, lectins, monoterpenes, and triterpenes which are accountable for the positive effects of the herbal products. 1,2The quality and quantity of these bioactive compounds determine the therapeutic effectiveness of herbal formulations. 1For instance, due to the abundance and diversity of the flavonoid and phenolic content of Datura stramonium, it has been reported to exhibit significant antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activities. 3rgemone mexicana, on the other hand, contains a lot of alkaloids and has traditionally been used to treat various dermatological disorders, warts, and inflammatory complications. 3 When monotherapy is inadequate to combat a clinical condition, traditional medicine employs polyherbal approaches. 4lyherbal medicines, which contain two or more herbal ingredients are often more effective than single drugs because of their complementary and/ or potentiating activities.The combination of two or more herbal extracts brings about increased therapeutic efficiency, enhanced pharmacological actions, faster relief, and reduced adverse effects as compared to conventional medicine due to a lower dose of administration. 1,2,4,5Polyherbal medicines are now widely preferred and used around the world because of their high effectiveness, ready availability, low toxicity, and environmentally friendly nature, and it reduces the time of treatment or the individual cost of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial drugs, resulting in lower prescription costs. 3,5The concept of polyherbal combination has been well established and has achieved remarkable success in allopathic medicine, providing patients with new hope. 6esistant to antimicrobials.Therefore, plant-derived products can regulate microbial growth in a variety of circumstances.Despite the development of new antibiotics over the last three decades, the problem of microbial resistance to these drugs has increased.Bacteria are known to have the genetic ability to transmit and acquire resistance to drugs used as therapeutic agents, 8 which underscores the importance of discovering and developing novel pharmaceuticals.
## (s3) Antimicrobial activity of polyherbal formulations
(p3.0) Based on ethnobotanical research, plants have been identified as a potential natural source of antimicrobial drugs that will provide novel or lead compounds that can provide unique or primary compounds to combat infections globally. 313][34] Tannins, for instance, are water-soluble polyphenols found in many plant foods and have been recognized as effective antibacterial agents against various pathogens.They have been reported to prevent the growth of microorganisms (fungi, yeasts, bacteria, and viruses) by precipitating microbial protein. 35,36annins can deactivate enzymes that cause microbial adhesion, as well as hinder the movement of certain proteins.They also combine with polysaccharides to form a complex. 37Similarly, flavonoids form a complex with either soluble or extracellular proteins and eventually bind to the bacterial cell wall.On the other hand, lipophilic flavonoids can considerably disturb the microbial cell membrane.Alkaloids are known to possess anti-tumour, analgesic, antispasmodic, and bactericidal potentials; Saponins are prominent for their anti-cancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, 35,36 and steroids contain anti-inflammatory activity. 35The antibacterial activity of these plant constituents is due to their ability to either block the production of the bacterial cell wall or disrupt the permeability of the cell membrane, ultimately resulting in the death of the microorganisms. 3,5tibacterial agents work by inhibiting or regulating enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, nucleic acid metabolism, and protein synthesis, a process known as translation inhibition.Another mechanism is membrane structure disruption, which causes changes in cellular functions.The majority of antibiotics are designed to reduce multiplication, thereby killing the organism.Some phytoconstituents in herbal formulations may bind to Gram-negative bacteria's membrane phospholipids and disrupt membrane integrity.Furthermore, it may inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis by blocking specific enzymes, thereby reducing the multiplication of bacteria and killing the organisms. 38e review findings revealed that the antimicrobial effectiveness of polyherbal formulations varied depending on the concentration and type of microorganisms tested.Some of the herbal remedies, such as THR-SK004, THR-SK010, and THR-SK011 used for the treatment of wounds demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against methicillinresistant S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. aureus with MIC 90 values of 4, 8 and 4 µg/mL respectively.This indicates that these herbal remedies meet the criteria proposed by Cos et al. (2006), which consider extracts with a selective activity and MIC values below 1-50 µg/mL as noteworthy.Also, polyherbal remedies such as Ambrex (8.7-23.4μg/mL), 4 Ya-Sa-Marn-Phlae (4-32 µg/mL) 20 , and KWTa, KWTb, KWTc, HBfs, HBts, AL, and FB (≤ 25 µg/mL) 39 had antimicrobial activities lower than 50 µg/mL, hence, they possess strong antimicrobial activity.

(p3.1) The majority of the polyherbal formulations demonstrated synergistic broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal activity, with MIC values ranging between 0.625-10 mg/mL.Some of the formulations, such as Ambrex, Chyawanprash, Plashbijadi churna, Vranahitkara ghruta, NOQ19, and Polyherbal nano colloids, etc exhibited antimicrobial activity comparable to the standard drugs.This suggests that these polyherbal remedies have the potential to be used as alternative treatments for bacterial and fungal infections.However, some polyherbal remedies such as Leone Bitters, Chandra Kalka, Sharkaradi Kalka, and Diakure did not possess any antimicrobial activity.This  The nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory results revealed that THR-SK010 ethanol extract exhibited NO production inhibition activity with IC50 value of 71.06, while the water extract was apparently inactive (IC50 > 100 µg/mL).
## (s96) Anti-inflammatory activity of polyherbal formulations
(p96.0) 4][45] The upregulated synthesis of inflammatory mediators results from the activation and enhanced activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), COX-2 enzymes, and pyrogenic cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin (IL-6), among others. 9,46herefore, to qualify as an anti-inflammatory agent in an in vivo assay, it should alter the effects of carrageenan-induced inflammation, leading to the alleviation of typical features such as redness, oedema, pyrexia, algesia, and tissue dysfunction. 46,47e results of the studies indicate that the polyherbal medicines investigated possess anti-inflammatory activities, with some of these remedies used in wound and diabetes management.Phytexponent, a polyherbal medicine used for pain and inflammation treatment, was examined for its anti-inflammatory activity using carrageenan-induced paw oedema mice.The study found that Phytexponent demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in a time-dependent manner, with greater efficacy at 250 mg/Kg BW than the positive control indomethacin (4 mg/Kg BW).The polyherbal medicine also significantly reduced oedema in a dose-and time-dependent manner, and it effectively inhibited both the early and late phases of inflammation.

(p96.1) The study suggests that Phytexponent's anti-inflammatory effects could be attributed to the inhibition of the COX enzyme.The timedependent increase in percentage inhibition of oedema may be due to a higher bioavailability of active molecules, following metabolism and distribution to target sites. 9Overall, these findings suggest that polyherbal medicines such as Phytexponent could be considered potential alternatives for the management of inflammation, as they demonstrate promising anti-inflammatory effects.Further studies are necessary to explore the mechanisms of action of this remedy.
