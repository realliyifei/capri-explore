## (s3) The Japanese BW program
(p3.0) The Japanese BW program began in 1932 under the command of Major General Shiro Ishii with the creation of the first biological weapons research facility at the Tokyo army's medical school, concealed as part of the Kwantung Army's Water Purification Department. Although considered as quite primitive in the level of technical sophistication, this program enrolled 3000 military personnel and hundreds of the foremost medical doctors and technicians and included more than 150 research centers, including the infamous Unit 731 (known as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department, this research center was located in Pingfang, Manchuria -responsible for human experimentation during the Second Sino-Japanese War), scattered throughout the Japanese empire, from Manchuria to Indonesia [26].

(p3.1) Organisms and diseases of interest to the Japanese program were possibly tularemia (Francisella tularensis), glanders (B. mallei), meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease (Neisseria meningitidis), brucellosis (Brucella spp.), typhoid fever (S. enterica serovar Typhi), dysentery (Shigella spp), cholera (V. cholerae), plague (Y. pestis, disseminated via the Uji bomb), anthrax (B. anthracis, disseminated via the Ha bomb), botulism (Clostridium botulinum; toxin) and smallpox (Variola major) (Table 1) [18,21].
## (s6) The Iraqi BW program
(p6.0) The Iraqi BW program was launched, in the early 1980s, by Saddam Hussein. Throughout the Gulf War, the Iraqi Biological Research Centre for Military defense, located at Salman Pak, studied the use of several bacteria (e.g., B. anthracis, B. melitensis, C. botulinum, and C. perfringens), toxins (e.g., aflatoxin, trichothecene), and viruses (e.g., camelpox virus, influenza virus, rotavirus, and West Nile virus) as bioweapons. This research culminated in the mass production of bioweapons either loaded into munitions (200 bombs and 25 ballistic missiles) or stored in spray tanks for later dissemination as aerosols. As a result, both troops on the battlefield and civilian populations in the region of conflict were threatened by the possible use of these weapons [35,36].

(p6.1) The United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), mandated to eliminate and prevent the revitalization of the Iraqi BW program, was expelled from Iraq, after seven years of work. As a consequence, Operation Desert Fox began. During its duration, the United States and Great Britain bombarded and destroyed three locations associated with the BW program [35,36].
