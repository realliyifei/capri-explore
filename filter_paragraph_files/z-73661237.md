## (s14) Non-Host Alternation on the Primary Host.
(p14.0) Non-host alternation in aphids is often referred to as "monoecy."(The word has a completely different meaning in botany.)In the Hormaphidinae, these "monoecious" or non-hostalternating cycles have probably been derived from "heteroecious" or host-alternating cycles by discarding secondaryhost generations in some way.In the tribe Cerataphidini, five species that form galls on Styrax complete their life cycles without migrating to the secondary host, while retaining a sexual generation (Figure 1(c)).They are Tuberaphis styraci on Styrax obassia in Japan [39], T. leeuweni on S. subpaniculatus in Sumatra [40], T. owadai on S. tonkinensis in northern Vietnam [11], Ceratoglyphina roepkei on S. paralleloneurus in Sumatra [72], and Astegopteryx spinocephala on S. benzoides in northern Thailand [17].Here we review the biology of three species.
## (s19) Gall Formed from an Axillary
(p19.0) Bud. Galls of Cerataphis brasiliensis (Figure 4(c)) are initially formed on or from axillary buds of Styrax benzoin [34].These incipient galls are simply enlarged to form sac-like galls.Galls of Cerataphis bambusifoliae are formed from axillary buds of Styrax suberifolius, probably in a similar way [33].
## (s20) Formation of Multiple-Cavity Galls.
(p20.0) Similar to the initiation of single-cavity galls, in the process of forming a multiple-cavity gall, the fundatrix is initially confined in a single cavity surrounded by lobes (Figures 8(a) and Figure 10(b)).Some of the lobes that enclose the fundatrix, however, are later differentiated into subgalls.First, inside the cavity, a niche appears on each of the lobes destined to be subgalls.At that time, the fundatrix has become an adult and begins to produce first-instar nymphs of the second generation.One or two first-instar nymphs enter each niche and begin feeding.Soon the nymphs in the niche are surrounded by plant tissues and confined in the newly formed cavity.Several subgalls are formed in this way, and the fundatrix is surrounded by the subgalls and a number of slender, solid projections which will not grow further (Figures 8(b) and 8(c)).The entire gall looks like a miniature "xiaolongbao" at this stage (Figure 8(c)).The number of subgalls varies both between and within species, but it is common to all known species that the fundatrix never enters any subgall.In some species (e.g., Ceratoglyphina styracicola), a small pocket is formed at the bottom of the cavity of the entire gall and the fundatrix hides there [104].As the subgalls, which are closed at this stage, grow outward, the entire gall opens (just as a flower opens from a bud) (Figure 8(d)) and the fundatrix is exposed again and left outside the closed subgalls.The fundatrix may still produce her offspring after all subgalls are closed.These firstinstar nymphs cannot enter any subgall and cannot grow to reproduce.They defend the closed subgalls from outside, probably against lepidopteran larvae that could bore into the subgalls [104,138], and are called "outsiders" (outside defenders).
## (s25) Coating of Gall Surface with Wax.
(p25.0) Gall-living generations of cerataphidines, including soldiers, produce wax.Honeydew excreted by the aphids is coated with the wax to form droplets (see Figures 6(b) and 12(f)), or "aphid marbles" [144], and soldiers push them out of the gall without being trapped in the honeydew [28,39,131,132,145].In species whose soldiers reside on the outer surface of their gall, the surface is coated with wax due to the activity of the soldiers.The outer surfaces of the galls of Tuberaphis owadai [11] (Figure 12(a)), T. sumatrana (our unpublished observation), and Cerataphis bambusifoliae [33] look silvery grey, and those of Ceratoglyphina styracicola [102] (Figure 3
## (s35) Predators of Gall-Living Generations.
(p35.0) Here we briefly review predators of gall-living cerataphidines.Larvae of the pyralid genus Assara (Lepidoptera) are one of the commonest predators.The larvae bore into cerataphidine galls.Within the gall they live in a silken net and thereby escape attack from soldiers and prey on aphids by protruding the head from the net.Three species have hitherto been identified: Assara formosana from galls of several cerataphidine species in Taiwan [107] and Thailand [17], A. holophragma from galls of Astegopteryx styracophila in Sumatra [19], and Assara seminivalis from galls of Tuberaphis owadai in northern Vietnam [11].The reason why soldiers of some species reside on the outer surface of their gall (Section 5.3.2) is probably that they defend the gall against such lepidopteran larvae.Larvae of the polyphagous vine moth Eupoecilia ambiguella (Tortricidae) often bore into subgalls of Ceratovacuna nekoashi one after another and eat both the inner walls and the aphids [138].Other Styraxfeeding moth larvae are also likely to be potential enemies of cerataphidine galls.
## (s37) Cleaning Behavior.
(p37.0) The second-instar soldiers push globules of honeydew, cast-off skins, and dead aphids out of the (sub)gall with their heads [28,39,131,132,145].Usually there remain few cast-off skins and few dead aphids in healthy cerataphidine galls.A possible exception may be Ceratovacuna nekoashi, whose soldiers do not actively push garbage out of their subgall.As mentioned in Section 5.3.1, soldiers have one or a few pairs of spine-like setae on the frons, which probably function as a brush for gall cleaning [39].

(p37.1) Age polyethism may occur in some species.Young soldiers of Tuberaphis styraci preferentially perform gall cleaning tasks, whereas aged soldiers exclusively exhibit attacking behavior [173].In this connection, it will be interesting to know whether those soldiers of Ceratoglyphina styracicola that fall off their gall (Section 5.3.2) are aged ones or not.
## (s38) Ants and Aphid Soldiers on the Primary Host.
(p38.0) No intimate symbiosis has been recorded between gall-living cerataphidines and ants.Usually ants are not seen on cerataphidine galls (e.g., [34]), but sometimes ants collect honeydew directly from openings of a gall [28,145] (Figure 4(a)).Kurosu et al. [145] observed that a soldier of Ceratovacuna japonica grasped a gall-attending ant of Pristomyrmex pungens, and that some ants crushed aphid soldiers with their mandibles on the same gall.
## (s40) Sterility of Soldiers in Galls.
(p40.0) Cerataphidine soldiers produced in Styrax galls are sterile and do not molt past the second instar.To confirm this, we have examined, for each species, approximately one hundred slide-mounted specimens of soldiers under a light microscope to determine whether they have the next (third) instar cuticle developing inside.A sample of non-soldier nymphs (i.e., reproductivesto-be) is likely to include some individuals with the next instar cuticle.For instance, of 94 first-instar non-soldiers of Pemphigus spyrothecae (Eriosomatinae, Pemphigini) we examined, 18 (19.1%)had the next instar cuticle developing inside [178].If no individuals with such a cuticle are found among about one hundred soldiers of a species, it will be reasonable to conclude that soldiers of the species are sterile.Of course, if the molting rate is much smaller, say one percent, the examination of one hundred individuals will be insufficient (the probability of finding no such individual will be near e âˆ’1 , or 0.37).In Table 4, the results for 19 species are summarized.The data support the soldiers' sterility in general, but there have been reported two exceptional cases in which some soldiers may molt.(1) In a mature gall of Astegopteryx bambucifoliae with 750 aphids, four out of 476 soldiers had the next instar cuticle developing inside [16].

(p40.1) (2) In a very young gall of Ceratoglyphina styracicola with 13 live aphids, five out of six soldiers had the next instar cuticle [105].No such soldiers were found in other galls of either species.Because soldiers are likely to be accepted by guarding soldiers of other conspecific galls [88,106], and because soldiers are shown to intrude into galls of other species [26,88], we suggest that the molting soldiers mentioned above were intruders from other galls.This possibility requires confirmation.
## (s41) Proximate Factors for Soldier Production. Proximate factors for the production of soldiers have been studied
(p41.0) with Tuberaphis styraci, because the species is one of few social aphids that can be maintained on an artificial diet for over two months [179].Shibao et al. [180] showed that high aphid density induces soldier production.When mother apterae and/or their first-instar nymphs are reared under crowded conditions, more soldiers (which are second instar) are produced.The combination of prenatal high density and postnatal high density enhances soldier differentiation in a synergistic manner [181].Direct contact with other aphids is a cue for soldier induction [182].Soldier production is enhanced by coexisting non-soldiers, but suppressed by coexisting soldiers [183].Thus, the percentage of soldiers in T. styraci is controlled by positive and negative feedbacks consisting of density-dependent induction and suppression of soldier differentiation [183,184].
## (s43) Butting Behavior.
(p43.0) Exules of many cerataphidines use their pair of frontal horns to butt conspecific aphids, or colony-mates, to gain occupation of a good feeding site on the host plant.In this interaction, a non-feeding aphid walks over to a feeding aphid, fixes all its legs on the plant, and repeatedly thrusts its body forward; the horns usually hit the aphid body being attacked.All instars but alates show this behavior.Though not frequently, soldiers (see Section 5.4.2) do, too [185].Large instars (apterous adults or wingpadded fourth-instar nymphs) more frequently defeat small instars (early-instar nymphs) than vice versa.Note that this butting behavior is different from attacking behavior against a predator or an enemy; in the latter, the attacker clasps the predator with its forelegs or all legs, while in the former the attacker butts a conspecific aphid while keeping all its legs on the plant.The butted aphid shows some defensive behavior, which varies between species.
## (s45) Percentage of Soldiers on the Secondary Host.
(p45.0) Percentage of soldiers on the secondary host has been intensively studied for Pseudoregma bambucicola on Bambusa multiplex by a number of researchers in Kagoshima, southern Japan [90,94,95,97].It Ã´ et al. [95] and Shibao [97], in particular, counted the number of soldiers for many colonies of P. bambucicola.The proportion of soldiers varies considerably across seasons (from zero to ca. 40% [90,95]) and colonies (from zero to 35% [97]).The consensus of the researchers is that many soldiers are produced in large colonies, and few or no soldiers in small colonies [95,97], although the correlation is not strong (Figure 13).The same tendency was also detected in Pseudoregma sundanica on ginger [194,200] and perhaps holds true for soldier-producing aphids in general.The tendency can be explained if we assume logistic growth of the aphid colony and the optimal proportion  of soldiers that maximizes the total productivity.Aoki and Kurosu [201] showed that a soldier of any given ordinal number (e.g., a first soldier, or a twelfth soldier) can be more readily produced in a large colony than in a small colony.This is because (1) a soldier benefits all non-soldiers in the colony by killing or repelling predators, and because (2) the value of a non-soldier (i.e., a reproductive) decreases as the colony size increases.Under these and some auxiliary assumptions, Aoki and Imai [202] carried out simulations, which indicated that the proportion of soldiers increases as the colony size increases.Although our model [202,203] does not take into account the replacing cost of soldiers (i.e., assuming immortal soldiers), it indicates how effective a soldier must be if it is produced: a soldier must increase each non-soldier's productivity by larger than r m /K.In other words, the marginal defensive efficacy of a soldier must be larger than r m /K, where r m and K are the maximum intrinsic rate of increase and the carrying capacity of the aphid colony without soldier, respectively.The ratio appeals to our intuition because r m and K are well-known parameters in the logistic equation.
## (s46) Leg-Waving
(p46.0) Behavior.Many apterous adults and nymphs (including soldiers) of some Pseudoregma species in a colony, when they are disturbed (e.g., when the host plant is lightly touched), respond by waving their legs all together.This leg-waving (or leg-shaking) behavior is noticeable in P. bambucicola [93,99,111,204] and P. alexanderi [185], which form colonies on bamboo shoots or twigs.Individual aphids lift their hind legs (and at times their abdomens, too) and move them up and down, their fore and mid legs remaining in situ [93,185].Synchronized with this behavior, many droplets of honeydew fall from the colony [185].

(p46.1) According to Sakata and It Ã´ [93], soldiers of P. bambucicola lift both their abdomens and hind legs more frequently than normal first-instar nymphs do.Shingleton and Foster [205] succeeded in inducing many soldiers but only a few nonsoldiers of Pseudoregma sundanica (on ginger) to shake their legs by blowing gently on them.Stern et al. [206] observed leg waving of many aphids when predatory wasps passed near and walked over the surface of a colony of Pseudoregma sp. on bamboo.Ã”hara [91] observed that a gravid female of the hoverfly Eupeodes confrater, which is a specialist predator of Pseudoregma bambucicola on bamboo and often lays her eggs on spider threads (Section 5.4.5),induced leg-waving behavior.

(p46.2) " Kenji Ã”hara (personal communication) once suggested to us that, by so doing, the female of E. confrater might assess defensive activity of the aphid colony and, based on this information, decide where to lay her eggs, that is, whether she should oviposit directly onto the colony or on nearby spider threads so that soldiers could not readily kill her eggs.
## (s47) Predators of Soldier-Producing Species.
(p47.0) Because soldiers on the secondary host can kill usual predators of aphids, predators often observed in their colonies are those that have developed some devices for escaping attack by the soldiers.The large coccinellid Synonycha grandis, the small coccinellid Sasajiscymnus amplus, the syrphid Eupeodes confrater, and the pyralid Dipha aphidivora are specialist predators of Psyche the soldier-producing species Pseudoregma alexanderi, P. bambucicola, and P. koshunensis in southern Japan and/or Taiwan [185,195,211].
## (s48) Defense by Monomorphic Nymphs: Piercing with Horns.
(p48.0) Some cerataphidine species have monomorphic first instars and do not produce morphologically distinct sterile soldiers; nevertheless these "monomorphic" first-instar nymphs have sharp horns and attack predators with the horns.Examples are an unnamed species of Pseudoregma found on Schizostachyum zollingeri in the Malay Peninsula [206] and the sugarcane woolly aphid, Ceratovacuna lanigera; the defensive behavior of the latter is well studied and treated here.
## (s49) Defense by Monomorphic Nymphs: Piercing with Stylets.
(p49.0) Tuberaphis takenouchii produces exules with no horns in its leaf roll galls formed on mistletoes of the family Loranthaceae.First-instar nymphs of the secondary-host generation have a dagger-like ultimate rostral segment and pierce insect larvae with their stylets [37].

(p49.1) First-instar nymphs of horned aphids may even attack predators with their stylets.Astegopteryx bambucifoliae, on the secondary host, produces first-instar nymphs with short horns which seem to be useless for piercing enemies.Some first-instar nymphs of this species were observed piercing insect eggs and pupae with their stylets [87].Agarwala et al. [226] report that horned aphids of Ceratovacuna silvestrii, which live on bamboo in northeastern India, cause irritation to human skin.It is still unknown whether the aphids pierce human skin with their stylets.
