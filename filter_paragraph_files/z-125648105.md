## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) In the food industry, thermal processing, including sterilization and pasteurization, is defined as the process by which there is the application of heat to a food product in a container, in an effort to guarantee food safety, and extend the shelf-life of processed foods [1].Thermal processing is the most widely used preservation technology to safely produce long shelf-lives in many kinds of food, such as fruits, vegetables, milk, fish, meat and poultry, which would otherwise be quite perishable.Although significant advances in non-thermal processing technologies have been made in the food preservation area during the past several decades, thermal processing is still considered the most reliable and effective preservation technology, especially for developing shelf-stable products.For thermal processing, steam or hot water under certain pressure is usually applied through the wall of a container to food with sufficient heat and for sufficient process time to achieve microorganism destruction.

(p0.1) The most challenging subject in designing a thermal process is to provide an adequate thermal treatment to guarantee that the slowest heating zone (SHZ) within a container of a product receives critical heat to inactivate microorganisms while, at the same time, avoiding detrimental side effects (or collateral damage), usually involving degradation of the food product.Indeed, thermal treatment not only destroys microbes; the process also degrades food quality and nutritive properties due to excessive heating [2].One of the most important goals of the canning industry is to minimize losses of quality and nutrients during thermal processing, while providing adequate heat treatment to produce the desired level of sterilization.Hence, it is necessary to predict and quantify the heat transfer rate in the container (with various dimensions and shapes to precisely develop a thermal process that not only guarantees safety, but also minimizes losses of quality and nutrients).Therefore, it is important to understand the process of heat transfer when implemented in the sterilization of food.To ensure safe thermal processing, it is also necessary to understand heat transfer mechanisms and proper predictive methodologies to choose proper processing conditions [2].
## (s6) Constitution of the CFD Model
(p6.0) Large-scale simulation requires an effort to gain details about field solutions, and a large amount of computing time.In the cases of CFD applications in canning, an axisymmetric approach can be used to reduce computing time.Many works of CFD applications in cans have been conducted with the axisymmetric approach, and have successfully predicted the heat transfer and fluid motion during the sterilization process of canned foods [20,[40][41][42][43].However, Tutar and Erdogdu [44] developed the simulation model in 3D (3-dimension) for canned foods, due to the axis-symmetric approach not being available for the horizontal can.Other simplifications are also used in the literature to cut down on both computing time and pre-processing.Successful 2D (2-dimension) simulations in thermal processing, when the length of one dimension is much longer than that of the other two dimensions, demonstrated an improved computing time with suitable accuracy [45][46][47].Modelling only the region of interest of large systems has also been used in the thermal processing of foods [48,49].Even though these simplification techniques have been applied successfully, it should be noted that they can also blemish the quality of the solutions.

(p6.1) In the computing process during CFD simulations, meshing affects the accuracy of solutions and the spatial discretization of the governing equations.To develop a CFD model with high accuracy, the mesh should be refined appropriately in regions of interest, and in areas where extreme gradients occur.However, a high mesh quality does not always lead to a superior degree of accuracy [29].Excessive improvement of mesh quality degrades the results with certain oscillations of temperature at the early stage of simulations.Therefore, research on the effect of mesh quality on solution quality has been continuously conducted to improve CFD models [50,51].Recently, unstructured mesh schemes have achieved mainstream use, primarily due to their ability for automatic discretization of complex CFD domains, without causing solution quality degradation [50].
## (s9) Liquid Foods
(p9.0) In contrast to solid food, identification of the SHZ for liquid food can be a difficult task.When liquid foods are thermally processed, fluid motion accelerates the thermal processing by improving the heat transfer rate.Hence, heat transfer of liquid food within a container is governed by both temperature variation and fluid motion [63].CFD and numerical simulation are commonly applied in the prediction of the temperature distribution and fluid motion during the thermal processing of liquid foods [64].During the thermal processing of liquid foods governed by natural convection, the temperature in the energy equation is coupled with the velocity in the momentum equations because the fluid motion is dependent on buoyancy force.CFD simulation models for the sterilization of liquid types of canned food were conducted by Lee and Yoon [20], and their flow patterns analyzed (Figure 2).With the application of a no-slip boundary for liquid products, the liquid close to the wall is at rest at the beginning of thermal processing.When the outer wall of the container later heats up, the liquid near the wall also heats up by conduction (nearly to the wall temperature) while the liquid at the center of the container is still at the initial temperature.Buoyancy forces are generated due to gravity and density variations in the can, and generated buoyancy forces are suppressed by the viscous force of the liquid during thermal processing.Velocity fields of the convective current depend on the resistance to flow of the liquid's viscosity and the strength of the buoyancy forces.Temperature-dependent viscosity decreases as the heating process proceeds, which leads to faster heating of the liquid food within a container by increased velocity.As the temperature of the product becomes uniform, buoyancy forces then decrease, which results in the cessation of recirculation and a reduction in velocity [6].
