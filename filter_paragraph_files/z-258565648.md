## (s1) Design and protocol
(p1.0) This is an overview of reviews on the effects of psychosocial work environment interventions.We structured the overview in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (18).Although PRISMA was devel-oped for reviews of primary studies rather than overview of reviews, most PRISMA items are applicable.
## (s9) Quality assessment
(p9.0) Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the reviews using the "Health Evidence Quality Assessment Tool" (20), (e-Appendix 4).The instrument includes ten yes/no questions (table 1) yielding a total score of 0-10 points.Scores of 0-4, 5-7 and 8-10 points indicate weak, moderate, and strong quality, respectively.Disagreements were solved through discussion and by involvement of a third reviewer, if necessary.
## (s11) Assessment of the effectiveness and the quality of evidence of the interventions
(p11.0) To judge the effectiveness of the interventions, BA and SJ independently assessed each review and summarized the main findings for outcomes of organizational-level interventions.Disagreements were resolved through discussions.We assessed the quality of evidence based on a rating system that we developed for this study, inspired by the rating systems used by Joyce et al (17) and the Navigation Guide (21).The rating system consists of five categories: strong, moderate, or low quality of evidence; inconclusive evidence due to lack of studies; and inconclusive evidence due to contradictory evidence.The definitions used for each of these categories are provided in e-Appendix 7.In short, our rating system, which was based on reviews as the unit of assessment, considered three aspects that we were able to retrieve from all reviews: The quality of the review (only reviews of high or moderate quality were considered), the consistency of results from multiple reviews (consistent versus less consistent results), and the proportion of controlled studies in the reviews (high, medium or low).
## (s19) Influence on work tasks or work organization (⋆⋆ Moderate quality evidence)
(p19.0) One review of strong quality (37) and three reviews of moderate quality (42,47,55) investigated the effects of increasing workers' influence on work tasks or work organization.There was moderate quality evidence that increased control can lead to positive health effects.

(p19.1) There was a tendency that the interventions were more likely to have a positive effect when the interventions were motivated by improving workers' wellbeing compared to interventions that were motivated by improving the economy of the company.
## (s21) Introduction program for newly trained nurses (⋆ Low quality evidence)
(p21.0) Two reviews of strong quality (22,30) and four reviews of moderate quality (49,50,54,69) investigated the effects of introduction programs, including mentor programs, for newly qualified nurses on various outcomes.There was low quality evidence for positive effects for improvement of competencies and inconsistent results for other outcomes, such as job satisfaction and turnover rates.
## (s22) Prevention of workplace violence (⋆ Low quality evidence)
(p22.0) One review of strong quality (32) and three reviews of moderate quality (41,59,66) examined the effects of interventions aimed at preventing violence from patients, which mostly included staff training.Three reviews (32,59,66) found that staff training can improve confidence, while two (32,59) found that it can also increase knowledge.However, with regard to actually decreasing violence, we only found low quality evidence.One review found less clear results for violence reduction compared to other outcomes (32) while another review found clearer results for violence reduction compared to other outcomes (66).
## (s24) Leadership training or development (inconclusive evidence due to contradictory results)
(p24.0) Three reviews of strong quality (25,28,36) and three reviews of moderate quality (43,51,58) examined the effects of interventions aimed at leaders (eg, change in management approach or management development, coaching, and training).The evidence across reviews was different for leaders and for employees.Several reviews (25,36,43,51) found positive effects for leaders, especially regarding their knowledge.However, the findings were contradictory with regard to employees: One review did not find effects on psychological symptoms for employees (25).Four reviews found mixed results for employee mental health (36) or wellbeing (28), moderate effects for organizational aspects (eg, employee job satisfaction) (51), and varying effects for employee work environment or health outcomes (58).
## (s28) Retention at work (inconclusive evidence due to lack of studies)
(p28.0) One review of strong quality that included various job groups (23) and one of moderate quality that included nurses (60) investigated interventions to improve retention of older employees.Although all six identified studies showed some positive effects on retention, neither review reached a conclusion because there were too few studies.Both pointed out that interventions initiating multiple strategies at the same time may be better suited for the retention of older employees.
## (s30) Summary of evidence
(p30.0) In this overview of reviews, we identified 52 reviews covering 957 primary studies of organizational-level interventions across a variety of job groups.We found strong or moderate quality of evidence for four specific intervention approaches and two work environment outcomes.This suggests that several types of organizational-level interventions can lead to improvements for employees.Among the 30 reviews studying specific organizational-level interventions, "changes in working time arrangements" was the only intervention approach with a strong quality of evidence, especially with regard to interventions that increased workers' influence on working time.The direct link between the content of the intervention in many of these studies (eg, more flexibility) and the measured outcome (eg, work-life balance) might have played a role for the effectiveness of this type of intervention.In addition, working time changes are typically implemented centrally for the entire workplace, thereby guaranteeing a high implementation degree, which might have contributed to the positive effects.Most other organizational-level workplace interventions of the psychosocial work environment require more complex and time-consuming implementation activities, where employees and their leaders need to agree on changes and implement them so that enough employees are exposed to them (70), which can lead to less consistent results across studies.We found moderate quality evidence for positive effects of the three intervention types "influence on work tasks or work organization", "health care approach changes", and "improvements of the psychosocial work environment", and low quality evidence for interventions focusing on "introduction programs for newly trained nurses" and for "prevention of workplace violence".

(p30.1) The results suggest that it might be easier to reach the more proximal effects of the interventions (improvements in the psychosocial work environment) than it is to reach the more distal effects (health and retention) (see figure 1).In this group of reviews, distal effects for health outcomes were only found for the two intervention types "influence on work tasks or work organization" and "health care approach changes", while none of the interventions types in this group found effects for retention.

(p30.2) Regarding "leadership training or development", we found inconclusive evidence due to contradictory results.Although several reviews reported positive effects for leaders, the results for employees varied considerably.Again, it may be easier to reach effects that are closer to the content of intervention (teaching knowledge about leadership styles) than to change the more distal outcomes (improvement in employee outcomes due to changes in leadership style).

(p30.3) Among the 22 reviews that examined organizationallevel interventions with a focus on specific outcomes, only interventions aiming to reduce burnout had high quality of evidence, whereas interventions aiming to improve employees' various health and wellbeing outcomes had moderate quality of evidence.Evidence was inconclusive for interventions aiming to improve retention (due to lack of studies) and for interventions aiming to reduce stress (due to contradictory results).

(p30.4) Of the eight reviews focusing on burnout, several included interventions that covered a wide variety of organizational-level changes (job training, teamwork, workflow changes etc.).One review (65) performed a moderator analysis which suggested that enhanced job control, social support, and elimination of stressors explain the effectiveness of the interventions.The findings of the other reviews also pointed at these aspects highlighting that especially interventions focusing on work schedules, workload reductions, improved work organization, enhanced job-control and participation, social support, communication, feedback, supervision and leadership support lead to positive effects.The high quality of evidence of these interventions might be due to that the interventions were able to cause substantial changes in the work environment (proximal effects), which, in turn, led to changes in burnout (distal effect).The combination with individual-level interventions in many burnout interventions might have further contributed to the positive effects.It needs to be noted, though, that the effect sizes of the burnout interventions were small.This was partly expected as a considerable part of the interventions were conducted with healthy employees.As Tanner-Smith et al (71) have pointed out, the magnitude of intervention effect sizes should be evaluated relative to the context of the intervention area and there is no clear rule to determine when an effect size is too small or large enough.Therefore, we did not consider effect size in the quality of evidence assessment.

(p30.5) The conclusions of the reviews investigating interventions to reduce stress were contradictory.The three systematic reviews that reported no effects (6,67) or low quality evidence for one specific type of interventions (improved working time schedules) (7) all conducted meta-analyses, while the other three systematic reviews synthetized the results narratively (29,31,57).The metaanalyses included studies both with and without effects, and did not show an effect after pooling the results and taking sample size into consideration.Compared to that, the reviews with narrative synthesis reported a variety of effects found in each study without taking sample size into account and concluded "some" evidence (57), "weak" evidence (31) or "tendencies" (29).

(p30.6) Interpretation of the results in the context of other overviews of reviews Our findings show similarities but also differences to previous overviews of reviews.Corresponding with our findings, the overview of reviews by Bambra et al (13) and Joyce et al (17) reported that increasing employee involvement (in general or specifically regarding control on working hours) overall has positive effects on employee health and wellbeing.Bhui et al (14), on the other hand, assessed mixed evidence for organizationallevel interventions.Williams-Whitt et al (16) reported positive results for absenteeism, productivity and costeffectivity for interventions that reduced job demands and increase job control.The reason for their more positive assessment of organizational-level interventions might have been that they included many reviews that investigated the reduction of physical work demands, whereas we focused on psychosocial work environment factors only.Similarly, the conclusion of the overview of reviews by Wagner et al (15) was more positive than ours as it reported mental health interventions to have positive impacts on workplace outcomes (e.g.absenteeism).Wagner et al included reviews focusing on individual interventions as well as interventions consisting of secondary and tertiary preventive measures, whereas our overview review focused mainly on primary prevention interventions conducted in healthy populations.
## (s31) Strengths and limitations of the overview of reviews
(p31.0) This article provides the most comprehensive overview of knowledge on the effectiveness of organizationallevel psychosocial work environment interventions to date.Compared with other overviews of reviews of interventions targeting the psychosocial work environment (13)(14)(15)(16)(17), our study identified the largest number of reviews by far, covering almost one thousand organizational-level intervention studies.The identification of 52 reviews of moderate or strong quality made it possible to investigate the quality of evidence of different types of organizational-level interventions.We showed that organizational-level interventions can differ in their complexity regarding implementation, and that only a few types of interventions with moderate-to-strong quality of evidence have been demonstrated to make changes in the more distal health outcomes.
## (s32) Implications
(p32.0) Our systematic overview of reviews suggest that organizational-level interventions have the potential to improve both employee psychosocial work environment and health outcomes.That means that both adverse psychosocial working conditions and adverse health outcomes are potentially, at least partly, preventable through appropriate changes in the psychosocial work environment.However, not all interventions led to the expected improvements, and some studies even reported negative effects of the interventions.The success of organizational-level interventions may depend on certain conditions like sufficient and continuous management support, appropriate problem assessment so the intervention fits to the problems to be solved, and the active involvement of employees (77,(83)(84)(85).However, unforeseeable contextual changes such as restructuring, downsizing, high turnover among leaders and/or employees, competing projects, and similar incidents that disturb or limit the focus needed to develop and implement workplace improvements, may impact the chances for positive outcomes (86).

(p32.1) Although knowledge about implementation aspects is growing (87,88), more research is needed to better understand why certain organizational-level interventions lead to the desired changes while others do not.Exclusively reviewing the effects of intervention studies will not provide this knowledge (74,75).Instead, we need studies that systematically investigate if the necessary preconditions for the interventions were in place, which contextual aspects might have had an influence on the intervention (83,88), and the extent to which failures can be attributed to implementation problems (26,89).Future studies, reviews, and overviews of reviews therefore should systematically assess the implementation of the intervention before evaluating the effects (37).In addition, more systematic research on implementation processes will help identifying essential factors for successful organizational-level interventions (83,90).
