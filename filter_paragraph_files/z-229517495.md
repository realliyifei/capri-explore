## (s6) Control of Tsetse Flies
(p6.0) Theoretically, Vector control remains the most attractive way of containing the disease [38]. In advance to any tsetse control operation, surveys are required to identify which flies are present in the area and their distribution [39]. Towards designing suitable control methods and monitoring of Tsetse flies, it is important to first understand the behavior of the fly [14]. In terms of controlling tsetse flies, only one stage (adult) is easily assess-able for control due to the absence of eggs, a free larval stage in nature and the fact that the pupal development occurs in the soil [15]. The vector controls methods range from synthetic insecticides to those non-insecticidal uses [38]. The non-insecticidal methods, the widely effective but no longer recommended control methods are selective elimination of wild animal hosts and bush clearing and non-insecticide impregnated traps [39]. It is designed to eliminate the shaded places where tsetse rest and lay their larvae and eliminate the wild blood sources used by the tsetse [33].

(p6.1) A synthetic insecticides based control methods are aerial spraying and ground spraying, odor baited and insecticide impregnated odor baited traps/targets, sterile insect technique (SIT) [22], insecticide treated cattle, and use of trypanocidal drugs [15]. Persistence insecticide application to tsetse resting sites is very widely used control method is now discouraged due to effects on non-target organisms [33]. High levels of tsetse control can be achieved by sequential aerial spraying of ultra low dosages of biodegradable products that involved the use of using pyrethroids such as deltamethrin at doses that are generally too low to provoke significant effects on other fauna [14].
