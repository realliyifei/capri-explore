## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) The main reasons for the increased interest in bioenergy are economic development, energy security, and independence [1,2], as well as the concern for reducing environmental pollution [3][4][5][6].The commercialization of biofuels has been carried out in different ways, including the establishment of standards at the national or zonal levels, the initiation of demonstration projects, as well as the elaboration of strategies [7].

(p0.1) Among biofuels, biodiesel is considered the best replacement for diesel fuel [8], which is probably due to its low toxicity, good lubricity, negligible sulfur content, lower exhaust emissions, higher flash point, and possible derivation from renewable sources of raw material [5,6,9].However, despite these advantages, large-scale use is still hampered by certain technical challenges, one of which is fuel quality [10].The poor oxidation stability, reduced adaptability to low temperatures, and microbial degradation of biodiesel are factors that result in the degradation of biofuel.
## (s3) Factors Affecting the Stability to Oxidation of Biodiesel
(p3.0) Oxidative, hydrolytic, ketonic, and microbiological degradation are the common processes of deterioration of fatty acids.It is known that oxidation is one of primary process by which fatty acids or their esters degrade [34].Auto-oxidation, thermal and enzymatic oxidation, or photo-oxidation are the main oxidation processes that lead to deterioration of biodiesel fuels' quality.Among all the processes, auto-oxidation is the most common.It is a chemical process where fatty acids from biodiesel composition are degraded by oxygen in the air [35].Usually, unsaturated fatty acids have double bonds between carbon atoms in their structure, and these double bonds can be cleaved by chemical reactions with free radicals, and the cleavage reactions also involve oxygen molecules.Typically, the oxidative degradation can cause the release of malodorous and highly volatile compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones.Since these reactions are free radical chemical reactions, they can be catalyzed by the sunlight.Factors that influence the rates of biodiesel oxidation include the chemical composition of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and its structure, the presence of natural antioxidants, the storage temperature and exposure to moisture, air, heat, and light, the presence of metal ions as catalysts, enzymes, and other impurities [36].
## (s4) Influence of Feedstock Composition on Biodiesel Properties
(p4.0) Consumers, mainly those in the automotive industry, have signaled that the low oxidation stability and poor cold-flow properties of biodiesel fuels are the main causes of the degradation in biofuel quality [37,38].Both causes are influenced by the feedstock used in the production of biodiesel, mainly by the content and composition of fatty acids in the feedstock; however, certain discrepancies have appeared between them.Biodiesel produced from raw material that contains a higher amount of saturated acids (SFAs) and a reduced amount of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) has a high cetane number, better oxidation stability, as well as a high calorific value, which means that the biofuel has a better quality [39].On the other hand, this can lead to an increased viscosity at low temperatures that causes poor cold-flow properties, being in contradiction with the quality properties of the biofuel and causing fuel filter clogging and reducing the ignition efficiency in combustion engines [40].In contrast, biodiesel containing a large amount of UFAs and a small amount of SFAs has a low cetane number, a low oxidation stability, and therefore, a worse quality.Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of how the interaction between SFAs and UFAs influences the oxidation stability and cold flow of biodiesel.
## (s11) Remediation Methods
(p11.0) Problems related to the low oxidation stability of biodiesel have attracted a lot of attention from both researchers and users.Attempts were made to solve them through physical, chemical, or genetic moderation methods.A variety of techniques to stop oxidation have been analyzed, such as vacuum technology, low-temperature storage, use of inert gas for packaging, reducing the partial pressure of oxygen in contact with biodiesel, enzyme deactivation, and the use of antioxidants.Therefore, the properties of biodiesel, such as high oxidative stability, good behavior in cold flow, and the reduction of combustion emissions, could certainly be obtained by modifying the fatty acid composition through the methods mentioned above.For example, Lanjekar and Deshmukh [37] showed that physical methods such as fractionation or winterization produce a biodiesel with low oxidation stability, which makes them non-viable methods because the biodiesel produced requires the addition of antioxidant additives.Mixing biodiesel with another biodiesel made from different raw materials affects the properties of the biofuel due to the variation of fatty acids in the composition, while mixing with diesel is quite expensive and unsustainable [88].On the other hand, the addition of branched-chain fatty alkyl esters has negative effects on the cold-flow properties, forming crystals and sediments that determine the clogging of fuel lines and blockage of filters [89].Chemical methods, such as hydrogenation, are not viable, primarily due to the formation of biodiesel with poor cold-flow properties, leading to the occurrence of flow restriction [90].
## (s14) Antioxidant Mechanism
(p14.0) The process of oxidation causes the quality degradation of biofuel, induced by autooxidation, photo-oxidation, thermal, and enzymatic oxidation.However, auto-oxidation is considered the most common way through which the oxidation process occurs, mainly due to the predominant amount of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) present in the feedstock [116].Therefore, in this paper, the mechanism for forming the oxidation stability of the biodiesel refers on auto-oxidation, because the other forms have smaller effects.
## (s18) Concentration Requirements for Antioxidants' Use
(p18.0) To be effective, the antioxidants must have a minimum concentration in the biodiesel mass, from which their activity increases linearly with the increase in concentration.However, there is a final concentration value, beyond which the antioxidant activity does not improve.In most cases, for example, a higher concentration of phenolic antioxidants acts as a pro-oxidant and intensifies the degradation reaction [129,130].The concentration interval between the minimum value (limit) and the final saturation value is known as the optimal interval, and this range is different for each type of antioxidant.Zhong and Shahidi [131] showed that the relationship between antioxidant activity and antioxidant concentrations is not linear, it follows a parabolic curve, and the minimum and maximum limits are not the same for different antioxidants-the values are higher for polar antioxidants.Chen and Luo [129] reported that the minimum critical concentration of antioxidants for a highly unsaturated biodiesel (more than 90%) is about 100 ppm to obtain a noticeable increase in the induction period (IP).The minimum limit concentration increases with the temperature, and at higher temperatures, a larger amount of antioxidant is required to obtain good biodiesel degradation stability.For example, Lapuerta et al. [132] studied the effect of temperature on the induction period of biodiesel derived from soybean oil, animal fats, and used cooking oil, using BHT as an antioxidant, and showed that at the higher temperature (130 • C), the antioxidant concentration required to reach the 8 h target was quite high (>25,000 ppm).The amount of antioxidant added in biodiesel is strongly influenced by the raw material used to produce the biodiesel and the technology.Natural antioxidants are much more sensitive to concentrations, and at higher concentrations, they show pro-oxidant effects.For example, the optimal range of the tocopherol concentration is 0.043-0.13%by weight, and at higher concentrations (>0.2%), it shows a pro-oxidant effect [34].In addition, in [110], it was shown that the optimal concentration for α-tocopherol in soy methyl ester is in the range of 600-700 ppm and, after this range, no antioxidant activity was observed.In general, the use of higher concentrations of antioxidants in biofuels should be avoided because it could lead to an increase in the delay period in combustion and is reflected by an increase in costs.
## (s19) Effects of Antioxidants on Biodiesel Cold-Flow Properties
(p19.0) Low cold-flow properties, such as cloud point (CP), pour point (PP), and cold filter plugging point (CFPP), strongly influence biodiesel's quality parameters.These characteristics of biodiesel are much less satisfactory than those of diesel [19,133].In low-temperature conditions, the crystallization process of biodiesel can occur, which affects the good functionality of the engine.This is due to increased viscosity, higher density, poor atomization, and vaporization, which affect the engine fuel system by clogging fuel filters and blocking fuel inlet pipes and nozzles [134].Therefore, tracking the changes in fuel quality parameters is decisive, especially before the biofuel is under the influence of certain environmental conditions.The properties of biodiesel under low-temperature conditions must be known to estimate the longevity and better performance of the biofuel for avoiding CFPP and low-temperature filterability [90].Thus, neglecting the properties of biofuel at low temperatures, crystals can form in its mass, and as a result, the viscosity, flow capacity, filtration, and volatility are affected, and this negatively influences the ease of starting the engine [39].In their study, Islam et al. [135] reported that low-temperature flow is much worse for biodiesel, which contains a higher amount of saturated fatty acids (SFAs).Improving the cold flow of biodiesel can be achieved using antioxidant additives, and this is considered a conventional method that is cost-effective and sustainable.These antioxidant additives improve the flow of cold biodiesel through the process of co-crystallization of fuel crystals and thus stop the further growth of crystals [136].In their study, Muniz et al. [137] showed that polymeric and phenolic compounds are good PP depressants and, respectively, performant antioxidant additives.Therefore, it is considered that the chemical structures of these additives consist of a series of hydrocarbons that can co-precipitate with the hydrocarbon chain of the fuel and thus prevent the development and solidification of wax crystals [138].During the interruption of nucleation, the crystal structure the occurs, formed from a three-dimensional shape, is narrow and long-pointed, thereby preventing biodiesel filters from blockage and slowing down the growth of crystals, thus avoiding the solidification.Anoop et al. [38] observed that the CP, PP, and CFPP of biodiesel from coconut (COB) were quite high, and the biofuel was prone to the formation of crystals due to the large quantity of SFAs.By reaching an IP of 6.0 h, according to EN 21214, the biodiesel presented a better oxidative stability but showed a poor cold flow.The addition of ginger and pepper extracts increased the IP by just 3% and is steadily higher using garlic.The use of antioxidant plant extracts in different concentrations (i.e., adding 0.4% wt to 1.0% wt) reduced the CFPP by 2 • C, but a much lower decrease in the CP and PP of biodiesel was seen, as reported in [38,139].According to the data presented, it can be emphasized that plant antioxidants have a higher efficiency in increasing the oxidation stability of biodiesel, and less so in maintaining suitable biodiesel cold-flow properties.
