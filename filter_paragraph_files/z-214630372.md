## (s1) RAGE
(p1.0) RAGE, a multiligand receptor, belongs to the immunoglobulin receptor superfamily that plays a critical role in innate immune response regulation [14]. It is a 50 kDa protein consisting of an extracellular N-terminal V-type (variable) and two C-type (constant) domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The receptor ligand-binding portion is the extracellular V-type domain, while the cytoplasmic tail is necessary for signal transduction as well as adaptor protein association. RAGE has been identified in two extracellular secreted forms: an endogenous secretory (es) form and a soluble (s) form [15]. Even if the sRAGE isoforms are missing transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, they maintain their ligand-binding ability, acting as decoy receptors and inhibiting the binding between RAGE with their ligands or with other receptors [16]; consequently, sRAGE treatment causes a downregulation of RAGE signaling, thus decreasing inflammation [17].

(p1.1) Nevertheless, sRAGE administration can cause a stimulation of signal transduction, thus inducing an inflammatory response [18]. The diagnostic role of sRAGE as a biomarker has been debated due to conflicting results. A correlation between circulating sRAGE levels and osteoporosis has been described [19], but low serum esRAGE levels may also be indicative of high bone resorption and vertebral fracture risk [20] because of the lack of inhibitory sRAGE decoy effects. It has been proposed that increased levels of circulating AGE and esRAGE are related to an increase in bone turnover and hip fracture frequency in elderly men, correlating with osteopenia and osteoporosis [21]. sRAGE levels are also negatively correlated to BMI and leptin level, suggesting sRAGE as a good biomarker of lipid metabolism and bone fragility.

(p1.2) RAGE is expressed in several cell types, such as mesenchymal stem cells, osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts, in which its expression is differently regulated during cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival processes [22].

(p1.3) RAGE binds endogenous DAMPs, including AGEs, S100 calgranulin proteins, HMGB1, amyloid β peptide, macrophage 1 antigen, and heat shock proteins, released in response to cell stress and death extracellularly [23]. RAGE stimulates, after ligand binding, downstream signaling pathways involving AP-1, NFAT, NF-κB, STAT3, and CREB transcription factors, inducing cytokine/chemokine transcription and regulating the apoptosis and autophagy process [24]. Interestingly, such transcription factors are also implicated in the RANK/RANKL pathway driving osteoclastogenesis [25]. Moreover, cell-/tissue-specific gene transcription and cell-type-related differences in adaptor protein signaling can contribute to cell-type-specific RAGE activation [26]. Even metabolic status, reactive oxygen species levels, and intra-and extracellular redox conditions may alter RAGE ligand properties, thus modifying downstream signaling [27,28].
## (s2) Alarmins
(p2.0) Alarmins are endogenous molecules with multiple functions, which are detected by the host immune system and contribute to host defense. Alarmins are constitutively expressed and can be considered the first defense against infections and traumatic insults. They initiate an innate adaptive immune response thanks to their capacity for recruiting leukocytes and activating dendritic cells (DCs). Alarmins stimulate DC maturation, allowing their migration and delivery in draining lymph nodes to the T lymphocytes, their antigenic contents thus resulting in adaptive immunity and T-cell-dependent long-term immune memory [45]. Alarmins have been found bound to cell granules, cell chromatin, cytosol, and vesicles, but it has been suggested that any nucleated cell may release them; moreover, their targets are chemotactic GiPCR and several activating receptors expressed by different cell types.

(p2.1) Several alarmins have been identified; here, we focused our attention on alarmins involved in various bone remodeling processes and in the onset and development of osteoporosis, and their potential role as therapeutic biomarkers.
## (s4) S100 Calgranulin Proteins
(p4.0) The S100 proteins are small molecules (10-12 kD) belonging to a highly conserved family of proteins consisting of 24 members distinguished by their different functions. It has been proposed that some of them exert intracellular regulatory effects, others possess both intracellular and extracellular functions, and others mainly have extracellular regulatory effects [64]. The involvement of S100 proteins in the regulation of differentiation, energy metabolism, proliferation, inflammation, apoptosis, migration/invasion, and Ca 2+ homeostasis processes has been proposed. This action has been correlated to interactions with several targets such as receptors, cytoskeletal subunits, enzymes, transcription factors, and nucleic acids. The ability of S100 proteins to control cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and survival in normal or pathological conditions, or in tissue repair has been proposed [64]. S100 proteins are linked to several human pathologies, such as cancer [58,65], neurodegenerative diseases [66,67], autoimmune diseases, and arthritis [68]. Moreover, a role of S100 protein in the cartilage repair process and osteoarthritis has been proposed [64,69,70]. S100 proteins are released by leukocytes during inflammation, and they act through RAGE (S100A12 and S100B) and/or TLR4 (S100A8, S100A9), requiring Ca2+ [71,72]. S100 family members can activate or inhibit receptors in a tissue-and context-specific manner. It has been proposed that RAGE-S100 protein signaling can promote the release of cytokines in endothelial cells and leukocytes through stimulation of NF-kB, thus causing a proinflammatory condition and contributing to inflammation-related diseases [73]. S100 proteins regulate skeletal metabolism in bone via direct and indirect action on bone cells [65,74].
## (s5) IL-1
(p5.0) IL-1 is considered a key immunoregulatory and proinflammatory cytokine, produced by the inflammasome, a caspase-1 activating molecular platform, in response to selected danger-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns [79,80].
## (s6) IL-33
(p6.0) Evidence has shown immunological control of bone remodeling. In addition to RAGE ligand alarmins, cytokines are also involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Bone cell activity is modulated by cytokines, but not all cytokines involved have an osteoclastogenic effect [2].

(p6.1) Among the interleukins involved in osteoporosis, interleukin 33 (IL-33) is considered an alarmin. IL-33 belongs to the IL-1 cytokine family, in which IL-1 and IL-18 have well-known actions on bone cells [94]. IL-33 is expressed by stromal cells, and its upregulation follows pro-inflammatory stimuli. It has different functions: as a traditional cytokine, as a nuclear factor regulating gene transcription, and as an alarmin. IL-33 interacts with the receptors ST2 (IL-1RL1) and IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), especially expressed by innate immune and T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Il-33 receptors have also been identified on Th1 lymphocytes, natural killer cells (NK), and regulatory T cells (Treg) [94]. Evidence shows a role of IL-33 in the pathogenesis of Th2-related diseases and in the regulation of adaptive and innate response [95][96][97].

(p6.2) IL-33 induces protective effects in inflammatory diseases. The protective or exacerbating aspects of the presence of IL-33 or its inhibitors depend on genetic predisposition, duration of disease (acute or chronic), dose or kinetics of IL-33, and the cytokine microenvironment. IL-33 acts at different levels (molecular, cellular, and transcriptional), mediating pluripotent functions in several diseases and, thus, having a potential therapeutic role in attenuating pathological processes [98].

(p6.3) The role of IL-33 in osteoporosis is debated. Some studies have shown contrasting roles of IL-33 in bone remodeling. As reported by some authors, IL-33 stops osteoclast formation from bone marrow precursor cells [99], while others showed IL-33 shifting the equilibrium in vitro from osteoclasts to the differentiation of alternatively activated macrophages [100]. A reduction in osteoprotegerin expression mediated by osteoblasts and an increase in osteoclastogenic factor release inducing bone resorption during inflammation mediated by IL-33 was proposed [101], even though some in vitro evidence suggests that IL-33 stimulates matrix mineralization [102]. IL-33 stimulates osteoblast maturation and decreases osteoclastogenesis [103] by participating in Th2-mediated processes [104]. Promotion of osteoclast differentiation from human monocyte precursors regulated by lL-33, thus inducing bone resorption independent of the RANKL pathway, has been proposed [105]. Moreover, IL-33 inhibition of RANKL-dependent osteoclast formation [106] has been shown. Similarly, other evidence shows a suppressive effect of IL-33 on osteoclast differentiation via the inactivation of a key regulator of RANKL-induced osteoclast formation, the nuclear factor of activated T-cell cytoplasmic 1 [107]. Moreover, experimental studies suggest that mice missing the IL-33 receptor show a low bone mass and an increase in osteoclast formation [108].

(p6.4) We also previously demonstrated in postmenopausal women, the anti-osteoclastic effect of IL-33, but the direct effect of IL-33 on osteoclast function or bone resorption remain unclear. Our results showed a negative correlation between IL-33 and the resorption marker carboxyterminal telopeptide of collagen I, confirming an inhibition of osteoclast differentiation mediated by IL-33 [10].

(p6.5) It has been proposed that IL-33 also inhibits osteoclast differentiation by inducing anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, IFN-y, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, thus leading to the differentiation of osteoclast precursors toward dendritic cells and alternatively activated macrophages [100].

(p6.6) Finally, a unique role of the IL-1 family of cytokines in modulating the reprogramming potential of Treg cells during inflammation has been recently identified. In particular, IL-1 and IL-33 are two distinct members of the IL-1 family of cytokines which play opposing roles in dictating the dynamics and functional specialization of Treg cells during immune challenges and chronic inflammation. Cell surface expression of the IL-33 receptor ST2 identifies a subset of functionally stable Foxp3+ Treg cells that are resistant to plasticity and loss of suppressive function, whereas IL-1 receptor I (IL-1RI) expression identifies Treg cells that acquire a Th17 cell phenotype and fail to suppress. Therefore, the production of IL-1β by dendritic cells promotes Th17 differentiation which contributes to the development of osteoporosis [109].
