## (s8) Research Problem
(p8.0) Regarding the investigated research problem, we classified the papers in three principal groups: (1) papers that investigate the usage of SE tools and techniques in the development of DL-based systems; (2) papers that propose the usage of DL-based techniques to solve SE-related problems; and (3) position papers or tutorials. Figure 4 summarizes our classification. The following subsections describe the papers in each group.
## (s9) Using Software Engineering Techniques in Deep Learning-based Software
(p9.0) We classified 10 papers in this category (12.3%), including papers that adapt SE tools and techniques to DL-based software (8 papers) and papers that describe empirical studies of DL-based software (2 papers). Papers that apply SE to DL are mostly focused on solving particular problems that appear when testing DL-based software [26,27,28,29,30,31]. However, we also found papers that describe quantitative metrics to assess DL-based software [32] and to support the deployment of DL-based software [33]. Finally, we found two  
## (s11) Position Papers
(p11.0) We classified three papers (3.7%) in this category, all published at IEEE Software. They describe the challenges and opportunities of using DL in automotive software [92,93] or provide a quick tutorial on machine learning and DL [94].  Table 2 shows the distribution of the DL techniques by research problem. As we can observe, RNNs are used in all problems, with the exception of security and bug localization.
