## (s2) WHY IS BONDING OF ZIRCONIA THE SUBJECT OF CONCERN?
(p2.0) The introduction of adhesive bonding systems and resin cements in dental practice, give the opportunity to practitioners to increase the retention of conventionally cemented crowns (in spite of critical values of taper, height and surface area of prepared teeth) and to achieve the optimal esthetic results in prosthetic reconstruction [10].Those two goals: durability and pleasant esthetic appearance of all ceramic restorations are the guarantee for the longevity of these restorations in mouth conditions.Obviously, this "team work" could be obtained through the strong bond which must be established between three different structures: ceramic core surface, cement layer and dentin.The paramount aim in this direction, presents possibility of chemical bonding which is the basic fundament for successful resin cement/ceramic core material connection.Additionally, such relationship includes the influence of various factors: wettability of ceramic by adhesives, the nature of ceramic surface (roughness), the composition of adhesive resin, the elements of handling procedures (performance of adhesive resin) and contamination during try in and bonding procedures [11].

(p2.1) Due to chemical inertness and resistance to aggressive chemical agents (strong acid, alkalis, organic and inorganic dissolving agents), bonding of zirconia to tooth tissues or other synthetic materials is difficult when compared to silica-based ceramic material [12].
## (s3) DIFFERENT APPROCHES IN ZIRCONIA/CEMENT BONDING
(p3.0) In order to obtain the strong bond to zirconia ceramics in clinical conditions, it is important for the bonding surface to be roughened, activated for chemical bonding and free of any contaminants [16].This objective premise offers different clinical and scientific answers which will be depicted through the following text.
## (s4) Surface abrasion or roughening
(p4.0) Surface abrasion or roughening (grinding, airborneparticle abrasion, rotary abrasion using diamond burs) establishes adhesion only through micro-mechanical retention.There is a general consensus that airborne particle abrasion with 50-110 µm alumina particles at 0.25 MPa is effective in roughening and cleaning the bonding surface of zirconia [17].However, the effect of those treatments on the mechanical properties of Y-TZP materials is controversial and both positive and negative results have been described in the literature [18,19].Also, it has been reported that particle abrasion creates sharp crack tips and structural defects, making zirconia more susceptible to radial cracking during function [20].Therefore, the recommendation of reducing the pressure during airabrasion and using particles up to 50 µm in size, could be beneficial [21].

(p4.1) Additionally, the particle air abrasion of zirconia, with alumina or other particles, produces lower bond strength compared to that of porcelain.The authors, who are standing behind those results, reinforced the opinion that mechanical adhesion alone is not suitable for providing the optimal resin bond strength.So, they promote the chemical adhesion in zirconia bonding [14,22].On the contrary, some others stated that elimination of particle abrasion as surface treatment would result in a dramatic reduction in bond strength.According to them, surface roughness is a key factor for adhesion to zirconia [23,24].
## (s6) Silica coating techniques
(p6.0) These techniques are used to facilitate a siloxan bond between a zirconia surface and resin cement.Fusion of glass beads and plasma spray seem to be complicated technique to achieve sufficient coverage [21].Information about quality of bonding of different zirconia ceramics through the literature is confusing.Some articles have confirmed that silica coating produced significant resin bonding for zirconia ceramics [22], while others certified reduced bond strength after artificial aging, with explanation that silica coverage was not firmly attached to zirconia.The usage of vapor-phase deposition technique, where silicon tetrachloride is combined with water vapor, is worth mentioning.This modification with silanization and bonding technique, improved adhesion of zirconia ceramic framework to resin cement [25].The next study, which compared long-term microtensile bond strength of different thickness of silica seed layers (3.2 nm, 5.8 nm, 30.4 nm) deposed on the zirconia substrate, showed similar or superior bond strength to resin cement, when compared to traditional silanization, but lower than that for silane-treated dental porcelain [14].Also, the authors discussed the importance of the layer thickness to bond strength in a function of time (up to six months).They concluded that silica layer may be only bonded to zirconia through mechanical and/or secondary chemical bonding (van der Waals bonds), which is not strong as covalent bonding formed between silane and resin cement.At the time, water absorption at the interface (between the layers) could decrease the bond strength of the silica coating.It is desirable to get homogeneous structure of deposited films to improve their resistance to degradation.Additionally, there is a report about negative effect of ultrasonic cleaning in distilled water on bonding to silica coated zirconia.This fact was addressed to possibility of ultrasonic cleaning to remove significant amount of silica-coating layer from the ceramic substrate.On the contrary, ultrasonic cleaning in alcohol did not show negative effect on bond strength.Therefore, it was speculated that the effect of water on reactive silica coated surface was of the greater importance than ultrasonic cleaning itself [35].
## (s7) Chloro-silane treatment
(p7.0) Chloro-silane treatment is introduced earlier as a pretreatment of zirconia surfaces by a group of authors [14,25].Actually, chloro-silane combined with vapor phase technique allowed pretreatment that deposits a silica-like layer on the zirconia substrate.The result is very thin coating (till 2.6 nm) which increased the number of chemical binding sites (Si x O y ) for the subsequent organ-saline primer, used in conventional adhesive technique.Application of the chloro-silane film increases the bond strength to resin cements enabling the values of microtensile bond strength similar to clinically common bonding technique.Further, the obtained effects are strongly influenced by layer thickness and surface topography.Also, deposition of a thin Si x Oy layer demonstrated a 60% mixed (adhesive/ cohesive) failure mode for roughened surface [21].
## (s9) Nanostructured alumina coating
(p9.0) Nanostructured alumina coating is presented as a new approach which is able to provide a strong and durable resin bond to Y-TZP [36,40].It is based on the idea of a rapid precipitation of aluminium hydroxides that originate from the hydrolysis of AlN powder in a diluted aqueous suspension.The result is heterogeneous nucleation of lamellar boehmite (γAlOOH) onto the surface of the immersed Y-TZP substrate.The nanostructured coatings consist of 6 nm thick and 240 nm long interconnected polycrystalline γAlOOH lamellas that grow perpendicular to the zirconia surface.During a heat treatment up to 900°C, these coatings are transformed into transient alumina, but without any change in the morphology [41].This non-invasive process can be classified as chemical pretreatment method that increases the surface area and penetrates the lamellar network, implying good wetting.The proposed technique offers some advantages over conventional surface treatment.Firstly, it does not create any flaws that can decrease the strength of zirconia ceramics.Secondly, functionalization of zirconia surface is more effective compared to air abraded and polished surface, even after thermo cycling procedures.Thirdly, technique is simple and can be easily transferred to dental laboratories [36].
## (s12) Laser application
(p12.0) Laser application and its capacity to increase the zirconia roughness for adhesive luting procedures have been discussed in details in other articles [9,18,43].Er:YAG (erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser has the ability to remove particles through ablation process by micro-explosions and vaporization.Laser effects obtained due to temperature changes (heating and cooling), induce phase transformation in the material leading to its damage.It has been suggested to lower the laser power and to enable surface irradiation with constant water cooling.But, the results are still questionable regarding the fact that laser irradiation is not as effective in increasing bond strength as air-particle abrasion under an in vitro experiment [18,43].
## (s13) Zirconia ceramic powder coating
(p13.0) It is presented as nondestructive approach to create unique surface characteristic of zirconia.It is produced by coating zirconia framework (presintered or fully sintered) with slurry containing zirconia powder and a pore former.During the sintering process pore former burns off leaving a porous modified surface.The advantage of this procedure is the possibility to change the pore size by using different sizes of pore former or repeating the coating process.Also, the modified surface is already present, applied by manufacturer of the framework.The restoration could be provided ready to bond without sintering process pore former burns off.There are a few clinical and in vitro data about the performance of this novel surface and its effects on shear bond strength.Additionally, current studies emphasize that bonding to the modified zirconia surface requires no airborne-particle abrasion or special cement.Although, this method could promote the wider application of zirconia, especially for the frameworks relying heavily on bonding (veneers and resin-bonded fixed partial dentures), it is too early for making any clinical recommendations before further evaluations [44].
## (s14) Gas-phase fluorination process
(p14.0) This process presents a method to chemically modify zirconia by creating thin oxyfluoride conversion layer on its surface that is receptive to organosilane attachment.The recommended procedure is complex and involves fluorination of zirconia in a planar, inductively coupled plasma reactor, vacuum (≈35 mT), and handling of a fluorine containing precursor gas.Essentially, the goal of the process is to apply the fluorinated plasma to the zirconia surface, to convert the top 1-3 nm into a ZrO 3 F 4 , which would further react with organo-silanes, enabling silicon bonding to the surface.The recent studies show that the fluorination treatment on roughened or polished zirconia displayed higher shear bond strength as compared to commercially available treatments [21].Therefore, this method could be useful on as-received substrates, where roughening or other modification techniques are not possible.Till now, the exact mechanism by which the fluorination improves bonding is unclear.It is hypothesized that oxyfluoride phase facilitates Zr-hydroxylation via H-F extraction in the presence of water, increasing the reactivity of zirconia surface with silane.But, ongoing experiments would bring more evidence on oxyfluoride stoichiometry and reaction pathways.Although, the creators of this procedure underlined some difficulties (research tool used in study does not exist), they offer, if this bonding protocol would be clinically adopted, to implement a small counter-top device as a clinical or dental lab setting [21].
## (s16) CONCLUSION
(p16.0) It is obvious that there are different options how to create durable bond zirconia /resin cements.But, it should be mentioned that under oral environment conditions, (masticatory forces, saliva influence, thermal factors, fatigue) bond reduction with various consequence, is often expected.Therefore, under critical clinical situations, selection of the bonding mechanism should be focused onto two important points: high initial bond strength value and long-term bond strength between zirconia-resin interface.

(p16.1) Very often, mechanical tests, like microtensile bond strength and shear bond strength are used to evaluate the bond quality between resin luting agent and zirconia substrate.But, it seems that these are not sufficient to show the behavior of the material under function, limiting the treatment effects.For the credibility of study results, it is proposed to combine mechanical tests with chemical analysis of bonding materials prior to clinical recommendation of technique or a new material [46].

(p16.2) Nevertheless, the problem of zirconia bonding to resin cement is still questionable.It is important to remember that zirconia crowns can also be luted with conventional cements if adequate crown preparation design provides sufficient retention without bonding.In closing this review, it is beneficial to focus on the experts' opinion which emphasizes that the use of phosphate monomer luting cements on freshly air-abraded zirconia present the simplest and most effective way for zirconia cementation procedure today [48].
