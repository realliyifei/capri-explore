Fields: Medicine

## (s3) Participants
(p3.0) The selected studies included a total of 164 SCI participants with complete motor deficit after injury and 131 healthy controls. Injury level was between C4 and C8. Only one study included high thoracic SCI between T1 and T4 [34] (see Figure 1 and Table 2).
## (s4) Apparatus
(p4.0) In all studies, the SCI participants sat in their wheelchair while control participants, when included, sat on a standard chair. One study provided no information about trunk stabilization [27], but in all other studies a strap stabilized the chest to the back of the seat except in two studies [34,37] where the trunk had no restriction for anterior motion. Systems used to record 3D motion were electromagnetic, electro-goniometric, optoelectronic, or videographic (see Table 2).
## (s5) Reaching movements Temporal kinematics
(p5.0) After C5 to C7 SCI MT increased [3,[25][26][27]35], PV decreased [3,24,26,27,34,35], but TPV was similar to that of control participants [3,26,27]. Compared with control participants, PV was approximately 30% lower and MT more than 40% slower (see Table 3). After C6 and C7 SCI the velocity profiles of the hand and fingers remained bell-shaped [3,24,25,35]. After C6 SCI variability in PV increased [35], the magnitude of the maximum acceleration and deceleration peaks was reduced and there were multiple acceleration peaks [25] (see Tables 3 and 4).
## (s6) Spatial kinematics
(p6.0) After C5 to C7 SCI elbow, hand, and finger trajectories remained straight and smooth [25,35]. Movement amplitude with the upper limb fully extended was reduced during maximal reaching in the superior and medial workspace [26]. After C6 and C7 SCI the pattern of joint rotation was similar to that of healthy participants [24,25], with an increase in hand height when the target was placed on the table at elbow height [3,24,35], a decrease in acromion displacement [34,35], and preserved endpoint accuracy [3,24,25,27]. Shoulder and elbow joint motion followed a linear relationship attesting to the preservation of temporal coordination [24,35]. After C6 SCI scapula movements increased [35] with more lateral scapula rotation during reaching in the lateral workspace than in healthy participants [24]. Scaling between shoulder and elbow rotation velocity was also preserved [36]. After C7 SCI finger trajectory variability increased [34] (see Table 4).
## (s7) EMG activity
(p7.0) After C6 SCI agonist muscles were not activated in a reciprocal pattern as in healthy individuals. Instead, shoulder muscles were almost exclusively active [25,43], and pectoralis major (a shoulder agonist) was active throughout the entire movement, whereas in controls it was active for only part of the movement [25] (see Table 4).
## (s8) Effect of elbow extension restoration
(p8.0) After tendon transfer in C5 to C7 SCI a slight increase in shoulder flexion and maximal height reached in the superior and medial directions was reported, but these changes did not reach significance [26].
## (s12) Overhead movements Temporal kinematic
(p12.0) After C6 SCI MT increased and shoulder velocity decreased [17]. After C6 to C8 SCI wrist flexion velocity decreased [40] while elbow velocity remained unchanged [17,40]. PV was almost half that of control participants, and MT nearly one and a half times slower (see Tables 3 and 6).
## (s13) Spatial kinematics
(p13.0) After C5 to C7 SCI participants presented less linear in hand trajectory and larger shoulder and elbow joint rotations than healthy controls [39]. After C5 to C8 SCI active shoulder flexion angle decreased while abduction angle increased compared with healthy controls [17,40,41]. After C5 and C6 SCI, the scapula was located more medially and exhibited 'winging' i.e. protrusion of the lower and medial parts from the thorax in the resting position. During shoulder flexion, there was less lateral rotation of the scapula for SCI individuals compared with controls [41]. After C6 SCI passive range of motion decreased during shoulder flexion (133°, SD = 9°) and abduction (133°, SD = 10°) [38] compared with healthy individuals (flexion = 156°, SD = 9°and abduction = 161°, SD = 11°) [44]. Movements of the glenohumeral joint were linearly related to both elbow and scapulothoracic joint movements attesting to preservation of temporal coupling [17,41]. After C7 and C8 SCI, forward and upward displacement of the shoulder increased [40] (see Table 6).
## (s14) EMG activity
(p14.0) After C6 SCI shoulder and elbow maximal isometric strength decreased [38]. Shoulder internal and external rotator strength decreased by 67% and 39% of control capacity, respectively [38], and contraction intensity increased [38] (see Table 6).
## (s15) Effect of elbow extension restoration
(p15.0) Elbow extension restoration after C6 SCI altered kinematics towards patterns observed in control participants as it reduced prolonged MTs [17], and increased shoulder flexion angle, which in turn decreased shoulder abduction angle and scapula lateral rotation [17] (see Table 6).
## (s16) Effects of extensor impairment on elbow flexion
(p16.0) Only one study analyzed the accuracy of fast, single-joint elbow flexion of either 10°, 20°or 30°with and without a constant extensor torque provided by a manipulandum [28]. After C5 SCI the maximal isometric strength of elbow flexors was about 50% of controls (mean 46.3 Nm versus 78 Nm). Without elbow extensor torque, movements were smooth but slower than in controls, and there were more errors. In contrast, movement velocity increased and errors decreased when elbow extensor torque was provided.
## (s18) Partial motor preservation after SCI
(p18.0) Markers placed on either the fingers, wrist, elbow or acromion revealed preserved trajectories after C5 to C8 SCI during both reaching and reach-to-grasp [24,25,28,35], attesting to the fact that SCI participants can produce efficient smooth trajectories similar to controls during reaching [25,35] and reaching-to-grasp [35]. TPV and the shape of the velocity profiles [3,26,27] along with reaching accuracy (attesting to endpoint accuracy [3,24,25,27]) were comparable with controls during reaching but not during reach-to-grasp and overhead movements. Indeed, motor control after SCI is characterized by strong kinematic invariants like movement endpoint accuracy and movement cost reduction as attested by the smooth trajectories and bell-shaped velocity profiles [45]. The relative preservation of these kinematic features is due to compensatory mechanisms, in particular during grasping and overhead movements as developed below.
## (s19) Shoulder and elbow coordination after SCI
(p19.0) Notwithstanding the overall reduction of degrees of freedom for the upper limb, SCI individuals show patterns of shoulder and elbow coordination similar to healthy individuals during reaching and reach-to-grasp [14,24,25,39].

(p19.1) That is, the linear temporal relationship [24,35] and the velocity coupling [36] between these joints are preserved, but at the cost of other reorganizational changes. The main change occurs at the scapulothoracic joint, where scapula rotation increases during reaching [35] and reachto-grasp [15,35], and both upward and external scapula rotations increase [15,40] in order to orient and stretch out the upper limb [24]. A complementary change occurs at the glenohumeral joint, where increased abduction mitigates the reduced flexion during overhead movements [17]. These scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joint compensatory movements ensure that mechanical dynamic interactions between the shoulder and elbow produce elbow extension despite triceps brachii paralysis [24].
## (s20) Reduction of the upper limb workspace after SCI
(p20.0) SCI leads to extensive sensorimotor deficits, for example, strength loss due to partial innervation (see Table 1) which leads to a decrease in full shoulder active range of motion Table 5 Kinematic characteristics of reach-to-grasping movements after tetraplegia (i.e. reduced shoulder flexion and abduction angles [17,38,41]) and a reduction of scapula lateral rotation [41]. Several complementary hypotheses have been put forward to account for the reduction of the superior and superiomedial reaching workspace in C5 and C6 SCI individuals. One idea is that a strength deficit in the glenohumeral joint agonist could perturb these movements. Indeed, partial denervation of the pectoralis major (normal innervation C5-T1) results in decreased strength of the primary humeral adductor [26]. Increased EMG contraction intensity after SCI [38] might be a marker of the difficulty associated with these movements. A second idea is that a proximal deficit in serratus anterior (normal innervation C5-C7) means that this muscle cannot resist against the tension of the rhomboids antagonist muscles (normal innervation C4-C5) which results in both a reduction in scapula lateral rotation and in scapulothoracic instability. This could decrease the shoulder's full active range of motion [41]. A third idea is that a distal deficit of the triceps brachii (normal innervation C7-T1) [26] might force C5-C6 SCI individuals to reduce overhead workspace in order to keep the elbow extended and to maintain the mechanical dynamic interaction between the shoulder and elbow. Fourth, shoulder ankylosis could reduce superiomedial and superior reach by reducting passive full range of motion by about 25°during both shoulder flexion and abduction compared with healthy individuals [38,44]. A final factor is shoulder pain, which is reported by more than half of the individuals with tetraplegia [46], and probably contributes to the functional limitation of the workspace.
## (s21) Requirements of grasping Transport phase
(p21.0) Jeannerod described the transport and grasping phases of reach-to-grasp [48] and studies of the former phase classically used reaching movements. SCI and healthy individuals exhibit similar reaching movements, which favors the partial motor compensation previously discussed. Kinematic differences appear during grasping, however, with prolonged deceleration of the transport phase as attested by (i) delayed TPV [3,14,37], (ii) asymmetric velocity profile of both the hand and fingers [3,35], and (iii) stable shoulder flexion, elbow extension and wrist tangential velocity before grasping [15]. These differences reflect the modification of the duration of the transport and grasping phases as the transport phase is initially quick but slows down towards the end [48]. Indeed, after SCI the transport phase of reach-to-grasp is characterized by reduced acceleration and prolonged deceleration durations, favoring final hand adjustment and successful grip. Finally, maximal grip aperture, a sign of grip preparation during transport [48], is lost because of finger extensor paralysis. Since grip aperture is passive and relies on wrist flexion and elbow pronation (favoring finger opening with gravity), grip preparation is effective only if the size of the object to be grasped is less than the maximal achievable grip width.
## (s23) Effect of elbow extension restoration
(p23.0) Restoration of elbow extension, either by tendon transfer surgery from posterior deltoid to triceps brachii [17,26] or the use of a manipulandum that provides an extensor torque [28], decreases MT [17,26,28] and reduces errors [28]. This is due to the restoration of elbow stiffness which in turn decreases the need for glenohumeral compensatory movements during overhead movements. Specifically, the shoulder abduction angle decreases favoring flexion [17] while the shoulder joint velocity concomitantly increases [17]. Surgery also improves strength and general performance, and participants report high satisfaction after their operations [49]. Although functional improvements are reported, surgery fails to completely restore motor function [50] as shown by the absence of improvements during both superior and medial maximal reaching [26].
