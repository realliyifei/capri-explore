## (s5) Neuro-endocrine system
(p5.0) During 1999-2002 we sampled the medulla oblongata from 82 specimens in order to analyze the concentrations of Hg, a known neuro-toxicant. The analyses showed that the concentrations of Hg were relatively low compared to liver and kidney burdens, as well as other species, probably due to high demethylation capacity of the liver, formation of Hg-selenium complexes, and fur as an efficient excretion route [29]. Despite the low Hg concentrations some inverse correlations of statistical significance were found. First, like in several other wildlife species [30,31], Hg-associated decreases in the levels of NMDA receptor were found. The NMDA-receptor facilitates the neurotransmission of glutamate and is important for learning and Hg (Figure 4). Second, DNA methylation seemed to decrease with increasing Hg concentrations indicating potential epigenetic alterations in gene expression [32].
