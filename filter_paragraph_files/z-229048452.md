## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) As an efficient, clean and resource-based waste treatment method, waste incineration power generation is favored by all countries in the world. As of 2018, the daily processing capacity of global waste incineration plants has reached 700,000 t d -1 [1]. However, the problem of corrosion has always been an important reason hindering the development of waste incineration power generation. Since metal parts such as water wall, superheater, heat exchanger, induced draft fan are eroded by medium and high temperature flue gas during the operation of the boiler, the material will continue to peel and thin. This not only increases the high costs for the enterprises concerned, but also makes it impossible to guarantee the safety of the boiler operation. The high-temperature corrosion of these heated surfaces CBMES 2020 Journal of Physics: Conference Series 1649 (2020) 012031 IOP Publishing doi: 10.1088/1742-6596/1649/1/012031 2 usually includes oxidative corrosion, thermal corrosion, chloride corrosion, etc. Among them, chloride corrosion is the main one. This paper reviews the anti-corrosion technologies commonly used in the heating surface of waste incineration boilers, such as hardfacing, thermal spraying, and remelting, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies, and prospects their application prospects.
## (s3) Supersonic Flame Spraying
(p3.0) Supersonic flame spraying (HVOF) has the characteristics of relatively low flame temperature and fast particle flight speed. It has obvious technical advantages in the preparation of metal alloys and cermet coatings with high density and low oxygen content. The working principle is that after the powder is heated and melted, it hits the substrate surface at high speed to form a coating. Due to the high combustion speed of the gas flame stream in this spraying method, supersonic powder particles can be obtained, and the kinetic energy of impact on the substrate is large, so the bonding strength of the coating and the substrate and the density of the coating are improved. Oksa et al. [6] sprayed several high-chromium thermal spray coatings with HVOF technology and tested their corrosion resistance. As shown in Figure 2, these coatings generally have good corrosion resistance at high temperatures.
## (s10) High Frequency Induction Remelting
(p10.0) High-frequency induction remelting refers to the use of high-frequency induction to heat and melt the coating using the induced current (eddy current) generated in the workpiece and coating. Compared with laser remelting, high-frequency induction remelting technology requires less equipment, simple process, and low cost. It is more suitable for the mass production of more regularly shaped products such as water-cooled wall pipe rows. In recent years, many scholars have done a lot of research on the bonding mechanism, the influencing factors of cladding parameters and the remelting mode in the process of induction cladding. In recent years, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and other countries have applied more and more self-fluxing alloy (NiCrSiB) coatings on the water-cooled walls of waste incineration boilers using high-frequency induction heating [13]. As shown in Figure 4, Valean [14] et al. sprayed a NiCrBSi coating on the surface of the substrate through an oxygen-acetylene flame, and then applied the high-frequency induction remelting technique to melt the coating again. After remelting, the porosity of the coating decreased from an initial value of approximately 15% to a final value of less than 3%, and both the wear rate and corrosion behavior were improved. In addition, as shown in Figure 5, induction remelting has a higher microhardness than flame remelting.
