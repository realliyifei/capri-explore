## (s2) Ethical Issues and Considerations in Academic or School-based Research
(p2.0) School-based Research entails an ethically challenging phenomenon that deserves strong attention.Researchers and Research Ethics Committee members need to be aware of the particular concerns that arise in schools in relation to the essential considerations of informed consent, confidentiality, and risk and benefits management.Specific attention needs to be given to the implications of the presence of multiple stakeholders.Similarly, particular attention should be given to the insinuations of the effect of professional roles and expectations on the ethical administration of the academic or scientific research process.Ethical issues in the school setting touch on three main areas of ethical concern: the informed consent process, confidentiality, and harm and benefit.Informed consent in educational institutions is illustrated by the involvement of various stakeholders, including researchers, parents and individual students, academic heads, teachers, and learners' peers.The added difficulty of the environment has implications for the administration of the informed consent process, including the decision at what point and in which approach every group of stakeholders needs to be involved in the process.The existence and divergent roles of these various stakeholders in the educational institution also have implications for addressing issues of confidentiality, especially due to the group environment in which participants are involved in the conduct of research and role anticipations within educational institutions.Harm and benefit in academic research are of non-physical and tangible nature; significant areas of concern relate primarily to the potential for psychological and social damage, the realistic presentation of likely benefits from research, and the issue of rewards and incentives for research participation (Felzmann, 2009).
