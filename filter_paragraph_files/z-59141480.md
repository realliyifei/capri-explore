## (s5) Evictions and Resettlement for Biodiversity Conservation
(p5.0) The creation of protected areas still results in the eviction or resettlement of local residents (figure 1).Especially in developing countries, where local residents often depend heavily on the natural resources in protected areas, and where land tenure rights are tenuous (figure 2), this results in severe impoverishment (Milgroom and Spierenburg 2008).However, beneficiary trade-offs are possible, if they are taken into account before planning, and attempts are made to study how biodiversity conservation could be combined with fostering local livelihoods and protecting local land rights.

(p11.0) © Marja Spierenburg vide better guidance for policy implementation, enforcement and evaluation."The importance of an explicit framing of assumptions is confirmed by Huitema and Turnhout (2009).Taking the example of the Dutch Environmental Planning Agency, they show that in assessing various environmental policy options proposed by political parties in the Netherlands, the agency used costefficiency as the most important criterion, which actually meant that the assessments were quite prescriptive in terms of demanding an alignment with government's financial policy without
## (s13) Strengthening Science-Policy Interfaces by Study ing Governance
(p13.0) Conducting assessments on a regular basis, as is the intention of the IPBES, may provide possibilities for a more flexible, adaptive approach to policy development in response to the successive assessments.However, the translation of their results into concrete policies depends on the political and institutional contexts in the various member states and on power relations between these (Voß and Bornemann 2011).
