## (s3) HA film wound dressing in burn treatment
(p3.0) Using the same HYAFF ® 11 technology, another product, named Hyalosafe, was designed and developed to provide effective coverage for superficial wounds. Hyalosafe is a transparent film wound dressing [ Figure 2] indicated for use in the treatment of first and superficial second-degree burns. The use of the product in deep partial thickness burns in pediatric patients to cover the burn at recovery, prior to dermabrasion has also been reported. [51]  The HYAFF ® 11 film is applied directly on the lesion, keeping the wound moist and thus creating the ideal conditions for a rapid re-epithelialization, avoiding the risk of tissue maceration. Thanks to the release of hyaluronic acid during HYAFF ® 11 degradation, Hyalosafe interacts with the lesion environment, facilitating the renewal of the epithelium. Importantly, as this membrane does not adhere to the wound, its removal is painless for the patient.
