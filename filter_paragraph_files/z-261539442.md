## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) With the rapid development of big data and information dissemination technology, fake news spreads through social media, posing a destructive threat to the sustainable development of society.False information not only undermines public trust and disrupts social order but also leads to misleading decisions, social division and opposition, which hinder the normal operation and progress of society.Fake news specifically refers to news reports that are untrue or exaggerated, such as Figure 1.These reports may be deliberately created to mislead the public or promote a specific agenda.The influence of fake political news on the Internet is more obvious than that of fake news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends or financial information [1].Compared with the truth, rumors tend to spread farther, faster and wider, which indicates fake news is more novel than real news.However, fake news often brings anxiety to people, affects the normal operation of society and threatens the sustainable development of society.
## (s20) Neuro-Cognitive Science
(p20.0) The sensitivity to fake news attacks depends on whether Internet users think fake news articles/clips are real after reading them.Arisoy et al. [52] tried to understand the sensitivity of users to text-centric fake news attacks through neurocognitive methods.They studied the neural basis related to fake news and real news through electroencephalograms (EEG), designed and ran EEG experiments on human users and analyzed the neural activities related to fake news and real news detection tasks of different types of news articles.Finally, they found that human detection of fake news may be ineffective and have potentially adverse effects.
## (s21) Linguistics
(p21.0) Linguistic researchers [53] use computer technology to analyze the language content of fake news in combination with relevant theoretical content and summarize the pragmatic features of fake news and the language structure that triggers the spread of fake news.Choudhary et al. [54] believed that it is promising to start from language indicators, using qualitative and quantitative data analysis as the analysis method, through the detection and comparison of 16 attributes under the three main language feature categories (vocabulary, grammar and syntactic features) manually assigned to news texts, to identify the systematic nuances between fake news and factual news.
## (s31) Explainable Fake News Detection
(p31.0) With the rapid development and application of machine learning and artificial intelligence technology in various fields, it is very important to explain the results of the algorithm's output to the user.The interpretability of artificial intelligence means that people can understand the choices made by artificial intelligence models in their decisionmaking process, including the reasons, methods and content of decision making [138].Simply put, interpretability is the ability to turn artificial intelligence from a black box into a white box.At present, explainable artificial intelligence methods are applied to different fields in different industries, including biomedical, financial applications, video payment, and media industries.The core of explainable artificial intelligence is to obtain human trust.From this, we can see that there are two important concepts that can explain artificial intelligence: trust and interpretation.For explainable artificial intelligence, the connotation of interpretation is that agents must communicate, exchange and run into different people repeatedly before they can gain human trust.Therefore, for the agent, when explaining, it is necessary to consider the different educational backgrounds, knowledge levels and other factors of the audience and then design the content and form of the explained information.

(p31.1) Figure 6 shows an interactive, explainable AI framework for human-machine communication.The main participants in the system are interpreters and interpretive audiences.Interpreters refer to artificial intelligence agents with many explainable AI methods that can make decisions based on specified tasks; the audience listens to the explanations given by the interpreters, who are generally the affected people involved in a task as well as decision makers and developers.The interpreter provides different forms of interpretation results to the interpretation audience according to different task scenarios; the interpreter, in turn, asks the interpreter questions so that the interpreter can make adjustments and optimizations.In this way, the interpreter will be more intelligent and put forward more convincing interpretation results.

(p32.0) With the rapid development and application of machine learning and artificial intelligence technology in various fields, it is very important to explain the results of the algorithm's output to the user.The interpretability of artificial intelligence means that people can understand the choices made by artificial intelligence models in their decision-making process, including the reasons, methods and content of decision making [138].Simply put, interpretability is the ability to turn artificial intelligence from a black box into a white box.At present, explainable artificial intelligence methods are applied to different fields in different industries, including biomedical, financial applications, video payment, and media industries.The core of explainable artificial intelligence is to obtain human trust.From this, we can see that there are two important concepts that can explain artificial intelligence: trust and interpretation.For explainable artificial intelligence, the connotation of interpretation is that agents must communicate, exchange and run into different people repeatedly before they can gain human trust.Therefore, for the agent, when explaining, it is necessary to consider the different educational backgrounds, knowledge levels and other factors of the audience and then design the content and form of the explained information.

## (s42) Conclusions and Future Work
(p42.0) The accuracy and reliability of information dissemination are of great help to the sustainable development of society and the economy.To embrace digital transformation, green information technology and responsible information production and consumption, we can reduce resource consumption and improve efficiency.These measures can achieve the long-term benefits of information dissemination.This paper focuses on investigating existing fake news detection technology and providing an overview of the research status of fake news detection methods.We collected almost all commonly used datasets, classified them from the perspectives of single-mode and multi-mode and summarized the research methods for fake news detection.This includes content-based detection methods, social network-based detection methods and knowledge-based detection methods.Considering the popularity of multimodal technology, we have also sorted out multimodal fake news detection methods.Additionally, this paper also discusses the research progress of fake news in multidisciplinary fields.Furthermore, we discuss the general fake news detection technology along with the explainable fake news detection method.Specifically, we propose a human-machine-theory explainable triangular communication framework.It is characterized by being peoplecentered, incorporating multidisciplinary knowledge and aiming to establish the sustainable development of a human-machine interaction information dissemination system.

(p42.1) Finally, based on the review of fake news detection presented above, several topics deserve further investigation in the future: (1) With the emergence of large models like ChatGPT, a wave of large models has been set off.These large models are far better than previous models in terms of language ability.There is potential for utilizing the knowledge and language abilities of these models to achieve improved performance in false information detection.However, research on fake news detection using large models is currently lacking.(2) In the era of AI-generated content, deep forgery technology is becoming more prevalent in various fields such as film and television, games and privacy protection.However, the malicious use of deep forgery technology poses threats to personal reputation, social stability and political security.Therefore, future research should focus on developing deep forgery generation and defense methods to address these challenges.

(p42.2) (3) From the perspective of explainable fake news detection, there is a need to develop comprehensive and explainable solutions.Currently, both in terms of model structure analysis and model behavior analysis, explainable artificial intelligence methods for fake news detection are not yet fully established.Designing an explainable fake news detection system has become crucial in the current complex information dissemination environment.(4) Brain science, neuropsychology, psychology and other multidisciplinary content are relatively cutting-edge fields of knowledge.At present, research on the neural mechanism of fake news is very limited.We believe that the special means in this field can contribute to the identification, defense and deeper understanding of fake news.
