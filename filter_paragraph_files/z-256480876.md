## (s25) Conclusions
(p25.0) The biggest aspect found during the analysis of the articles was that there was no one grain that was primarily better than another in terms of environmental performance.A particular grain can do well for some environmental parameters, and in another it can do poorly.Each grain has its own specific strengths and weaknesses that account for the emissions that they release to the environment.For best practices going forward, these data suggest that we should continue growing a variety of grains so that we don't create an excess of one particular pollutant.Another suggestion is that we determine which emissions we want to minimize and which ones we can give more leeway to.Currently, lower emissions such as ozone and greenhouse gasses have a high priority, and we can work towards growing fewer crops that have these emissions or making those grain supply chains less environmentally impactful.Liu, et al. 2018 Australia Conventional farming practices used in Australia.Rajaniemi & Mikkola, 2011 Finland Conventional farming practices used.Rajaniemi & Mikkola, 2011 Finland Reduced tillage on the soil.Charles, et al. 2005 No Region Listed Good agricultural practices, as stated by Swiss regulations.Yan, et al. 2014 China Average taken from 123 farms.Charles, et al. 2005 No Region Listed Good agricultural practices used, based on Swiss regulations.Charles, et al. 2005 No Region Listed Good agricultural practices used, based on Swiss regulations.
