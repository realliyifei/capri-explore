## (s9) Results on the publication selection
(p9.0) In total, 399 publications were filtered, 279 of which were excluded after reviewing their abstracts and titles.Full text of the remaining publications was carefully read, and 13 of which were further excluded.Finally, 6 studies were considered to meet the inclusion criteria [26][27][28][29][30][31].A flow chart of publication selection is shown in Fig. 1.
## (s17) Discussion
(p17.0) The number of SRs/MAs investigating FMT as a treatment for UC has shown an increase in recent years [26][27][28][29][30][31].These studies had varying degrees of overlaps in terms of inclusion of trials, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes, and their results were not always organized in a consistent manner.Therefore, a more comprehensive overview is required to improve the current understanding of the effectiveness and safety of using FMT for treating UC.
## (s19) Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
(p19.0) The current overview included the latest studies published before January 2023, most of which were published within the last three years.UC patients in all the reviews were included regardless of their age, gender, or severity of illness.Outcomes included in the reviews were also relatively comprehensive.All the primary outcomes and most secondary outcomes in each review were included.Importantly, all reviews were consistent in their conclusions regarding the effects of FMT in UC, and incidence of serious adverse events were confirmed by additional metaanalyses with more trials and expanded sample sizes.

(p19.1) Various FMT protocols placed restrictions on the overall completeness and applicability of the evidence.Although no statistically significant heterogeneity was found in the previous SR/MA and current additional meta-analyses, Fig. 3 Forest plot comparing the rate of combined clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with UC receiving FMT vs placebo Fig. 4 Forest plot comparing the rate of clinical remission in patients with UC receiving FMT vs placebo Fig. 5 Forest plot comparing the rate of endoscopic remission in patients with UC receiving FMT vs placebo there were differences between the main study experiments in terms of delivery route, total dosage, frequency, and donor selection.Fecal quality of donors, quantity of infusions, and mode of administration all affect how FMT works [44].To date, the protocol of FMT has not been standardized [44].Therefore, more trials are needed to determine the optimal timing, total dosage, frequency, delivery route, and the most suitable donor for FMT.
## (s20) Implications for research
(p20.0) The GRADE system was applied to evaluate the certainty of evidence for using FMT to treat UC, where the majority of comparisons were rated as moderate or low, suggesting that additional studies may have a significant impact on the level of confidence in the estimate of effect or could even change estimate.As for sample size, the vast majority of the primary trials included were considered as having a small sample size, which was the main reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence of primary trials.Small trials could increase the risk of small-trail biases and relevant issues of publication bias, because small negative trials are less likely to reach full publication, which can result in overly positive results in comparisons [45,46].Thus, more future trials using a standard FMT protocol (such as best timing, total dosage, frequency, delivery route, and the best donor) with greater participant motivation and larger sample size are needed.
## (s21) Strengths and limitations
(p21.0) To the best of our knowledge, this was the first overview of SRs/Mas that investigated the efficacy of using FMT for UC treatment.By systematically collecting, evaluating, and synthesizing the evidence for FMT for UC, the findings of this study could facilitate evidence-based decision-making process [47].However, assessing methodological quality, reporting quality, and evidence quality could be a subjective process, as a result, outcomes may differ depending on the decisions made by various researchers in evaluating each factor.Furthermore, reviews that included both UC patients and Crohn's disease patients were excluded, which may lead to selection bias.
