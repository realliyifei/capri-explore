## (s6) Discussion
(p6.0) In this section we identified two major types of multimodal representations -joint and coordinated. Joint representations project multimodal data into a common space and are best suited for situations when all of the modalities are present during inference. They have been extensively used for AVSR, affect, and multimodal gesture recognition. Coordinated representations, on the other hand, project each modality into a separate but coordinated space, making them suitable for applications where only one modality is present at test time, such as: multimodal retrieval and translation (Section 4), grounding (Section 7.2), and zero shot learning (Section 7.2). Finally, while joint representations have been used in situations to construct representations of Table 3: Taxonomy of multimodal translation research. For each class and sub-class, we include example tasks with references. Our taxonomy also includes the directionality of the translation: unidirectional (⇒) and bidirectional (⇔). , [47], [203] more than two modalities, coordinated spaces have, so far, been mostly limited to two modalities.
## (s11) ALIGNMENT
(p11.0) We define multimodal alignment as finding relationships and correspondences between sub-components of instances from two or more modalities. For example, given an image and a caption we want to find the areas of the image corresponding to the caption's words or phrases [98]. Another example is, given a movie, aligning it to the script or the book chapters it was based on [252].
## (s15) Implicit alignment
(p15.0) In contrast to explicit alignment, implicit alignment is used as an intermediate (often latent) step for another task. This allows for better performance in a number of tasks including speech recognition, machine translation, media description, and visual question-answering. Such models do not explicitly align data and do not rely on supervised alignment examples, but learn how to latently align the data during model training. We identify two types of implicit alignment models: earlier work based on graphical models, and more modern neural network methods. Graphical models have seen some early work used to better align words between languages for machine translation [216] and alignment of speech phonemes with their transcriptions [186]. However, they require manual construction of a mapping between the modalities, for example a generative phone model that maps phonemes to acoustic features [186]. Constructing such models requires training data or human expertise to define them manually. Neural networks Translation (Section 4) is an example of a modeling task that can often be improved if alignment is performed as a latent intermediate step. As we mentioned before, neural networks are popular ways to address this translation problem, using either an encoder-decoder model or through cross-modal retrieval. When translation is performed without implicit alignment, it ends up putting a lot of weight on the encoder module to be able to properly summarize the whole image, sentence or a video with a single vectorial representation.
## (s17) FUSION
(p17.0) Multimodal fusion is one of the original topics in multimodal machine learning, with previous surveys emphasizing early, late and hybrid fusion approaches [50], [247]. In technical terms, multimodal fusion is the concept of integrating information from multiple modalities with the goal of predicting an outcome measure: a class (e.g., happy vs. sad) through classification, or a continuous value (e.g., positivity of sentiment) through regression. It is one of the most researched aspects of multimodal machine learning with work dating to 25 years ago [243].

(p17.1) The interest in multimodal fusion arises from three main benefits it can provide. First, having access to multiple modalities that observe the same phenomenon may allow for more robust predictions. This has been especially explored and exploited by the AVSR community [163]. Second, having access to multiple modalities might allow us to capture complementary information -something that is not visible in individual modalities on their own. Third, a multimodal system can still operate when one of the modalities is missing, for example recognizing emotions from the visual signal when the person is not speaking [50].
## (s19) Model-based approaches
(p19.0) While model-agnostic approaches are easy to implement using unimodal machine learning methods, they end up using techniques that are not designed to cope with multimodal data. In this section we describe three categories of approaches that are designed to perform multimodal fusion: kernel-based methods, graphical models, and neural networks. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) methods are an extension to kernel support vector machines (SVM) that allow for the use of different kernels for different modalities/views of the data [70]. As kernels can be seen as similarity functions between data points, modality-specific kernels in MKL allows for better fusion of heterogeneous data.
## (s24) Hybrid data
(p24.0) In the hybrid data setting two non-parallel modalities are bridged by a shared modality or a dataset (see Figure  3c). The most notable example is the Bridge Correlational Neural Network [167], which uses a pivot modality to learn coordinated multimodal representations in presence of nonparallel data. For example, in the case of multilingual image captioning, the image modality would always be paired with at least one caption in any language. Such methods have also been used to bridge languages that might not have parallel corpora but have access to a shared pivot language, such as for machine translation [148], [167] and document transliteration [100].
