## (s1) Towards CSLR
(p1.0) In medicine, in order to mitigate the SLR updating issue, Elliot et al. [9] introduced the concept of Living Systematic Review (LSR). An LSR is an SLR that is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available.
## (s19) Discussion
(p19.0) The motivation for the elaboration of the CSLR process is to provide a systematic process to help mitigating the intermittent SLR update problem contributing to avoiding missing new potential new relevant research in evidencesyntheses or decision-making. According to Nepomuceno et al. [23], actions to keep SLR updated are of great importance to the SLR research field.

(p19.1) The CSLR process unifies several pieces of knowledge on SE SLR updates that have been investigated separately, integrating them with DevOps and OS concepts. As a consequence, we observed benefits such as (i) facilitating the identification if the SLR has been updated or not (ii) assisting the identification (search and selection) of potentially relevant evidence; (iii) making potentially relevant evidence available in open repositories that are freely accessible by the SE community; (iv) supporting the decision on the need to update an SLR; and (v) supporting SLR authors throughout the update process.
