(p10.0) Vascular injury requiring repair. of the antibiotic bacterial resistance and high costs of health administration.Papasoulis [11], in a systematic review, concluded that the use of antibiotics in uncomplicated lesions and with conservatively treated fractures can be ruled out.The antibiotics of choice are cephalosporins, cefazolin, with similar efficacy through intravenous or intravenous administration.

(p10.1) When surgical methods are needed, the treatment of choice is the immediate primary immediate fixation.However, it was observed that until the late 1970's and early 1980's, the conservative treatment of Gustillo I gunshot femoral fractures was still used.In the mid-1980s, comminuted and unstable femoral shaft fractures, including firearms, were being treated by intramedullary nail.Plates and screws had a higher incidence of deep infection due to larger incisions and exposure of soft tissues and external fixators had infection with pin traction and problems with knee rehabilitation and bone healing.In the 1990's, Wiss [12], Bergman [13] and Nowotarski [14] published non-comparative retrospective studies assessing the treatment of gunshot-induced femur fractures by early intramedullary nailing, all with good results and low rates of complications .The main limitation of these studies was the low level of evidence.
## (s14) Gustillo II gunshot fractures
(p14.0) Gustillo grade II firearms fractures can be considered as of intermediate severity.Long [7], when discussing the treatment of firearm fractures with wounds greater than 2 cm, emphasizes the importance of meticulous debridement and finds a 43% infection rate in these fractures.Comparing fracture complications with wounds less than 2 cm (0% of infection) with greater than 5 cm (50%), Gustillo II fractures would have more similarity to Gustillo grade III fractures than Gustillo grade I fractures .Regarding the technique of surgical fixation, Long recommends an early definitive fixation (less than 48 h) in grade 2 and late fixation in fractures grade 3.

(p14.1) If the results of this study are correlated with the classic works of Gustillo and Anderson, it can be said that Gustillo II grade fractures with wounds bigger than 1 cm and smaller than 2 cm, without bone devitalization may have a more conservative treatment, like Gustillo I.Those Gustillo II grade fractures with wounds bigger than 2 cm and tissue devitalization should have a more aggressive treatment, like Gustillo III.It is recommended in cases of doubt, look at other criteria to define the best approach, such as the time taken to hospital care, the circumstances and the anatomical site where the victim was shot.Table 3 shows articles about Gustillo II gunshot fractures
