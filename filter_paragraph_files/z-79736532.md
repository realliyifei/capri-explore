## (s0) The Eye at High Altitude
(p0.0) High-altitude environments present additional ocular risks to the unwary traveller and these have been comprehensively reviewed by Izadi and colleagues. 18Common high-altitude eye problems include high altitude retinopathy, 19 optic disc swelling and dry eyes.High altitude retinopathy is manifest by engorged and tortuous retinal vessels secondary to hyperviscosity due to polycythaemia, 20 and may present with retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots and papilloedema.The traveller's visual acuity may be preserved or it may be threatened if a macular haemorrhage occurs.The increased prevalence of dry eyes at altitude has been associated with both a decrease in tear production, as well as accelerated tear evaporation due to the dry and windy environment. 21Dry eyes are often merely an irritation to the traveller; however, severe episodes increase susceptibility to eye infection, and can be distressing, especially when accompanied by deteriorating vision.Travellers with comorbidities are more vulnerable to the effects of hypoxia at altitude and may be advised to avoid such environments. 22For individuals who are susceptible to dry eyes, minimal contact lens usage should be recommended.Additionally, lubricating eye drops should be provided for symptomatic relief of dry eyes.More viscous ointments provide prolonged relief at the expense of visual acuity. 16The use of goggles and wraparound sunglasses should be advised as they can also limit the evaporation of tears.
## (s1) Traumatic Eye Injuries
(p1.0) Bungee-jumping is a popular extreme adventure travel activity in countries such as New Zealand.Bungee-associated ocular injury is believed to be due to a sudden increase in venous pressure from the rapid acceleration and deceleration over the short period of a jump. 23Intravenous pressures can rise to more than 100 mm Hg following a rapid-3G deceleration during a bungee jump, and this may result in intraocular haemorrhages. 3Tractional retinal detachment and its related complications can also arise from the mechanical effect of the gravitational force on vitreous movement.Traumatic ocular injury has also been inflicted by the bungee cord itself. 24ravellers planning a bungee jump should be forewarned about these potential complications and advised to ensure that stringent safety guidelines are adhered to by bungee service providers.Protective eyewear should also be recommended to prevent traumatic injury.
## (s2) Advising Travellers With Eye Disease
(p2.0) Pre-existing ocular conditions increase susceptibility to several travel-related eye problems.Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the optic nerve associated with excessive intraocular pressure.The presence of glaucoma exacerbates insults to the optic nerve when exposed to a hypoxic environment such as high altitude. 21There is evidence of exacerbation of angle-closure glaucoma on long-haul flights as the dimly lit environment causes mydriasis, precipitating a pupil block. 7This principle could be applied to a wide range of travel-related activities in low ambient light environments and warrants additional precautions.Oral acetazolamide has been suggested as a viable alternative to the use of beta-blockers and is used in some trekkers to prevent acute mountain sickness. 21Medical gases such as perfluoropropane or sulphur hexafluoride are often used in vitreoretinal surgery.This presents risks to air travellers due to Boyle's law, which ordains that, as the cabin pressure at flight altitudes is lower than the sea level, any intraocular gas bubbles will expand and increase the intraocular pressure.Patients with recent vitreoretinal surgery involving intraocular gas should be strongly advised not to undertake air travel, regardless of the volume of gas applied. 25
## (s3) Contact Lens Use During Travel
(p3.0) Contact lens users have a greatly increased risk of bacterial, viral, fungal, and amoebic infections.This is mainly due to the inability to maintain proper lens hygiene during travel, especially in wilderness environments.The additional complications of freezing lenses and solutions as challenges to hygiene at high altitude environments have been discussed in the literature. 9The lifespan of contact lenses is greatly reduced by cold and dry winds, and a dried lens can fracture in the eye, increasing the risk of corneal abrasion and infection.Sleeping with contact lenses in situ can also excessively desiccate the lens, causing it to adhere to the cornea.Travellers on long trips commonly fall asleep while wearing contact lenses, and should be advised to remove their lenses prior to falling asleep, or to avoid using them while in transit, especially in the low relative humidity of an aircraft cabin.The use of contact lenses during exposure to water pre-disposes to infection, as waterborne micro-organisms can adhere to the lens. 26This is a greater issue when swimming in stagnant ponds or lakes in tropical countries due to the wide variety of micro-organisms present.The risk of infection can be reduced by adopting measures such as washing hands regularly and for an adequate duration with soap, washing the lens container, using daily disposable lenses and wearing airtight goggles when swimming.
