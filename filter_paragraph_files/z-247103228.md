## (s2) Saliva Production in Humans
(p2.0) Saliva is a very complex fluid that is mainly composed of water combined with electrolytes, minerals, buffers, growth factors, enzymes, cytokines, proteins, and immunoglobulins [10][11][12][13]. In humans, it is produced from the major and minor salivary glands of the mouth, as depicted in Figure 1.
## (s7) Systematic Diseases
(p7.0) Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by the inflammation of the exocrine glands, mainly of the lacrimal and salivary glands [52,53]. The two categories of the disease are the primary form, which is characterized by the independent occurrence of the disease, and the secondary form, which is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Some common oral manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome are mainly xerostomia and hyposalivation, autoimmune sialadenitis, and dental caries [54]. The xerostomia that is associated with primary and secondary Sjögren's syndrome has been attributed to the progressive lymphocytic infiltration that gradually destroys the secretory acini of the major and minor salivary glands.
## (s9) Management of Xerostomia
(p9.0) The establishment of the correct diagnosis is considered as the most crucial step in the management of patients with xerostomia, since it encompasses the distinguishment of patients with subjective complaints from those presenting salivary gland hypofunction as well [4]. Once a diagnosis is established and an underlying etiology is identified, a stepwise management approach can be implemented, aiming to institute preventive measures, alleviate symptoms, treat oral manifestations, and improve salivary function.
## (s11) Symptomatic Relief: Salivary Substitutes
(p11.0) The symptomatic relief or control of oral dryness includes hydration (frequent sipping of water), discontinuation or reduction in xerogenic medications, and elimination of common dry mouth offenders, such as tobacco and alcohol [76]. Moreover, artificial salivary substitutes (i.e., commercial products containing specific ingredients, whose properties resemble those of the natural saliva) are frequently used as symptomatic treatments for patients with decreased salivary flow rate [77,78]. In fact, they act as oral lubricants that maintain the lubrication of the mucosa and, hence, relieve the sensation of dryness, without stimulating the salivary flow. However, it should be pointed out that saliva substitutes' action present limited duration and, therefore, a frequent re-application is required, which creates issues around patient adherence and increases the cost of therapy.

(p11.1) An ideal salivary substitute should resemble the properties of human saliva and, simultaneously, provide a pleasant taste aiming to a convenient self-administration and increased patient compliance [79,80]. The development of artificial saliva requires in-depth understanding of both biological and rheological (e.g., viscosity and film-forming wettability) properties of human saliva, which is composed of a mixture of macromolecules. Specifically, human saliva is regarded as a non-Newtonian fluid, because of the salivary glycoproteins' presence. This characterization means, in essence, that saliva's viscosity varies, depending on the shear rate [81]. Thus, the efficacy of artificial saliva as a lubricant is partially dependent on its viscosity and how this changes with shear rates [82]. Since different shear rates may be present in the oral cavity-from 60 to 160 s −1 during processes such as swallowing and speaking-the high importance of the aforementioned phenomenon is apparently highlighted [83]. So, salivary substitutes are expected to have a viscoelastic pattern similar to normal human saliva in order to provide similar viscosity and film-forming properties. Taking into consideration that the principal aim of saliva substitutes is to ensure the lubrication of oral tissues, it is obvious that apart from the viscosity, lubrication is considered as another important factor for the clinical acceptance of saliva substitutes. Concerning the biological properties of artificial saliva, substances of natural origin, including enzymes such as lysozyme and peroxidase or proteins such as lactoferrin and mucin, may be utilized in order to provide high biocompatibility [84].
## (s14) Freedent White TM
(p14.0) As a low-tack chewing gum, it provides a better tolerance in patients with dental prostheses as compared to the normal-tack chewing gums. Nevertheless, several adverse effects (i.e., irritation of mouth, nausea etc.) have been reported.

(p14.1) Wrigley company [108,115] V6 chewing gum Acceptable consistency and no reports of mouth irritation. Gadbury [116,120] Dentirol chewing gum Satisfying taste and acceptable consistency. Alleviates the symptoms without increasing the saliva flow rate.
