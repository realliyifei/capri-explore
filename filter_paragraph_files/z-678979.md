## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Several articles were written from the beginning of the fifties about the presence of plant enzymes in multiple forms. The major discussion was questioning whether these forms are artifacts that rose during the purification or not. To show that these forms are not artifacts in 1952 Jermyn divided his original peroxidase juice into two parts by acidic precipitation. The precipitate contained the A and B, while the supernatant the C and D points. Two components were found in the purified peroxidase solution; one migrated to the anode, the other to the cathode (Jermyn and Thomas, 1954).
## (s5) Isozyme analysis in grape
(p5.0) Enzyme banding patterns for over 60 varieties of wine and table grapes were determined by gel electrophoresis by Wolfe (1976). Enzymes were extracted from ripe berries of each variety and separated by electrophoresis in a starch gel. Enzyme bands were detected by developing the gels in a buffered solution that produced an insoluble dye at the site of enzyme activity. The varieties were assayed for leucine aminopeptidase, indophenol oxidase, acid phosphatase, catechol oxidase, alcohol dehydrogenase, esterase, and peroxidase. The first four enzymes listed were found the most useful for distinguishing varieties.
