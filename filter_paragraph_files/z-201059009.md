## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) In 2009, the ePart conference was organized in Linz, Austria for the first time.ePart was derived from and co-located with the eGov conference, which in 2009 was already in its 8 th year.The first year, DEXA was the organizer, but from 2010 the conference moved to the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), under technical committee 8 -Information Systems, as part of working group 8.5: Information Systems in Public Administration 1 .The conference arguably emerged from the EU FP6 Demo-Net2 project, as many of the Demo-Net participants were active in establishing ePart.Demo-Net aimed at integrating what was then a fragmented group of individuals working on eParticipation-related themes.A total of 23 papers mention Demo-Net in text or references, 17 of these published in the first three years of the conference.

(p0.1) The preface to the first "electronic participation" proceedings states the purpose of the conference as "reviewing research advances in both social and technological scientific domains, seeking to demonstrate new concepts, methods and styles of eParticipation.â€¦ It aims to bring together researchers from a wide range of academic disciplines."[1].The focus on eParticipation as a multidisciplinary field is emphasized throughout the history of the conference.
