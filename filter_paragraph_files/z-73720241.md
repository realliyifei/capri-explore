## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) S chizophrenia is a common psychiatric disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 1% in general population and high financial and social costs 1 .The clinical manifestations are divided in positive symptoms (hallucination, delusion), negative symptoms (social withdrawal, lack of emotion) and cognitive decline (memory dysfunction), which are used in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, since there is no biomarker for the disease.The physiopathology of the disease is unknown, whereas several theories have emerged to explain its features: neurotransmitters dysfunction (several neurotransmitters have been related to schizophrenia, such as dopamine, serotonin, GABA and glutamate), neurodevelopment abnormalities, neurodegenerative disorder, accelerated aging syndrome, neuroinflammation disorder, among other described models 2,3,4 .

(p0.1) The oldest theory was elaborated in 19th-century by Kraepelin, who described the disease as "dementia praecox", since young patients progressively, deteriorated its cognitive functions while suffering from hallucinations 2 .This description approximates schizophrenia to clinical progression of known neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease, creating basis for the development of neurodegeneration hypothesis for schizophrenia 3 .Furthermore, some evidence showing enlargement of ventricles during disease-years, glutamate excitoxicity, oxidative damage and other chemical similarities with recognized degenerative processes support this theory.However some authors argument, as it occurred with Kraepelin afterwards, neurodegeneration model would not explain alone all the clinical features of schizophrenia, including why a subset of patients improve after treatment 2,3 .

(p0.2) The second theory elaborated was neurodevelopment.Despite it had been first proposed in 1873 by Thomas Clouston, who described clinical features of the "adolescent insanity", only in mid-1980 it resurged, with more robust evidence.Existence of premorbid stage, cranial-facial abnormalities, neuroimaging findings in first-episode patients, increased risk for the disease when obstetric and gestational complications support the theory of neural development disorder.This model, however, do not explain satisfactorily why the onset is during adolescence/young adults period and how a subgroup of patients recover after treatment.Detailing the development hypothesis was tried to address these problems, such as the neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion 2 , the progressive developmental disease 3 and the "two-hit" hypothesis 4 .

(p0.3) Lastly, neuroinflammation model surged more recently when, for example, Stevens introduced the idea of inflammatory markers in cerebral spinal fluid of schizophrenia patients and correlated this with the neuropathology 5 .The most substantial evidence for this hypothesis is the findings of statically significant MHC classes in three independent Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) 6 .Furthermore, a history of autoimmune disorders and maternal infections increase the risk of the disease; and, although inconsistent, some report activated microglia in schizophrenia brain samples 6 .

(p0.4) Classifying schizophrenia as a neurodevelopment, neurodegenerative or neuroinflammation disorder would be a step toward more specific therapies, as it would facilitate and guide future researches for diseasemodifying agents and symptoms treatment, besides improving prevention measures.
## (s3) Neurodegeneration
(p3.0) Schizophrenia is a behavioral disorder, which reveals itself in neurocognitive dysfunction.Neuropsychological data indicate these functions are relatively stable over time after illness onset, whereas morphological data indicate a neurodegenerative process.Determining whether schizophrenia is a neurodegenerative illness with progressive structural changes in the brain after presentation of the illness, or a neurodevelopmental disorder starting in early life, is of significant importance for understanding the pathophysiology.

(p3.1) In one study, authors found that CRP40/mortalin-2 mRNA was reduced in schizophrenia at first episode and in chronic stage, possibly reflecting increased cell stress or protein damage 7 .Heat shock proteins 8 are stimulated by protein denaturation which can occur in thermal stress, oxidative stress, hypoxia, mitochondrial collapse etc. Proteotoxic stress is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders and heat shock proteins are differentially regulated in this conditions (some are overexpressed, others are underexpressed).

(p3.2) In the same rationale, which alleges cellular damage to the cell, one study showed greater DNA damage in drug-naïve schizophrenia subjects, when compared to control, though the DNA machinery was preserved 9 .

(p3.3) The hypothesis-free epigenetic experiments also support the cellular damage evidence.Authors described altered methylation pattern at sites previously associated with degeneration disorder, such as Hnrnpa1 gene (hypomethylated), regulated together with stressinduced phosphorylation signals.Some mutations have already been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia 10 .GWAS performed in association with cognitive measures in schizophrenia have not showed any significant SNP for cognitive impairment in the disease, but a polygenic score with little variance explanation.This method of analysis permits the identification of the most statistically relevant SNPs for the condition tested, in a large SNP pool (commonly hundreds of thousands SNPs), independently of the examiners hypothesis.

(p3.4) Individual SNP studies have implicated Saitohin gene 11 and ERBB4 pathway 12 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.Saitohin is in linkage disequilibrium with tau gene, which codes a well-described protein probably involved in Alzheimer's disease.According to Bosia et al. 11 , it may predict poorer cognitive function in the subset of schizophrenia patients with the risk allele.ERBB4 pathway, in the other hand, is described in both cell death and cell growth metabolism.SNPs in ERBB4 or NRG1 (Neuregulin-1 -described in more details in "Neurodevelopment") may alter transcription factor bond and therefore promote metabolism disturbances, but these results do not elucidate whether this is important for apoptosis and/or neurogenesis in schizophrenia.
## (s4) Neuroinflammation
(p4.0) Some evidence suggests the significance of neuroinflammation and immunogenetics in schizophrenia.Microglia is the major players in innate immunity in the CNS.They respond quickly to even minor pathological changes in the brain and may contribute directly to the neuronal degeneration by producing various proinflammatory cytokines and free radicals.In many characteristics, the neuropathology of schizophrenia is closely associated with microglial activation 13 .

(p4.1) Microglial activation (microgliosis) is often accompanied by reactive astrocyte activation (astrogliosis), and indicates neuroinflammation.However, evidence for either microgliosis or astrogliosis in schizophrenia is inconsistent.In the study performed by Catts et al. 14 , the subset of schizophrenia patients with increased expression of inflammatory markers (such as cytokines) showed increased expression of astrogliosis-associated mRNA when compared to subset of schizophrenia patients with less expression of inflammatory markers, but they did not show difference between the overall sample of schizophrenia subjects and control.Apparently, antipsychotic might reduce gliosis and alter astrocyte morphology.

(p4.2) Another gliosis-associated gene, IFITM, mRNA was analyzed 15 .Interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) is a viral restriction factor produced by stimulus of cytokines and interferon.Mouse models for mild chronic inflammation (for example, NF-kB deficiency) have increased levels of IFITM and decreased levels of GABA neurons.The study found the same results in patients with schizophrenia (increased levels of IFITM mRNA in cortical blood vessels and an association with GABA neurons decrease).These findings would support the theory of neuroinflammation in schizophrenia.However, another paper rejected the evidence of neuroinflammation 16 , by comparing microarray data of schizophrenia and classical inflammatory conditions (such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and dermatomyositis).They concluded that the mRNA sets could be separated in two distinct groups: the known inflammatory conditions and the neuropsychiatric conditions.The possible explanation for the fact that some inflammatory molecules are found in the neuropsychiatric diseases is that parallel cellular signaling mechanisms exist between immune system and nervous system.In other words, the same molecules have different roles in the systems, for example: complement receptor has a role in immune activation as well as in synaptic 'pruning' 17 .
## (s5) Neurodevelopment
(p5.0) Rosanoff proposed an association of schizophrenia with complications of pregnancy and delivery as early as 1934.According to these, the etiology of schizophrenia may involve pathologic processes, caused by both genetic and environmental factors, which begin before the brain approaches its adult anatomical state in adolescence 3 .

(p5.1) Several genes in the context of neurodevelopment have been studied, as we can see in the Table 1.However, only a few SNPs had nominal statistical association with the disease, whereas some have been connected with neuroimaging differences and cognitive function in both control and schizophrenia subjects.

(p5.2) Associations of SNPs with schizophrenia in smallscale studies were found for SNPs in GSK3B 21 , BRAP 19 , DLCK1 20 , MYT1L 22 and BDNF 23 , but not for NTNG1.Some were validations of previous Genome Wide-Association studies (GWAS) results.

(p5.3) Moreover, SNPs in genes important for neurodevelopment have been correlated with neuroimaging variances [26][27][28][29][30][31][32] and cognitive impairment 24,25,33 .Specific genes had effects in both healthy control and schizophrenia subjects; other had effects only in schizophrenia individuals or the effects on schizophrenia and control were contrary.These findings might not indicate an essential role of the genes in the genesis of schizophrenia, but may demonstrate the importance of neural development variances on the great clinical variety of schizophrenia.

(p5.4) Trying to eliminate hypothesis bias, some authors performed GWAS.The first concluded that one SNP in EIF2AK4 gene was associated with response to haloperidol 34 .We must consider, however, that it did not reach GWAS statistical significance and the two samples tested showed opposite tendencies.The second GWAS performed found no association between any SNP and one of the clinical dimensions in schizophrenia (positive symptoms, negative symptoms and mood disturbances).In this study, only polygenic scores including thousands of genes could predict case-control status.Maintaining the analysis of large-scale studies, another three papers were identified.The first tried to correlate sets of SNPs with connectivity within brain default mode, which may indicate the resting neuronal activity 35 .This approach differed from GWAS as they used multivariate analysis instead of univariate analysis.In other words, they used clusters of interacting SNPs instead of calculating SNPs risk individually.Another interesting difference was the fact they used the brain default mode and not the diagnosis itself as the variable in the analysis.This means they used an intermediate phenotype, instead of the "final" complex phenotype, which might be the result of interactions from several other intermediate phenotypes.This approach has been considered in the literature as an alternative of studying schizophrenia itself, because of the complexity and diversity of the disease 36 .The authors found several groups of SNPs correlated with each pattern of brain default mode, mainly related to neurogenesis, cell adhesion, axon guidance and inflammation, among others.The second study intended to validate subsets of neural development-related genes found in previous GWAS datasets and verified enrichment of significative p-values in the neurodevelopment subset 37 .Finally, the third study also collected the evidence from previous GWAS and created metabolic pathways related to the genes products 38 .Both neurodevelopment and neuroinflammation processes were represented by the pathways elaborated, but the authors emphasize the possible role of Toll-like receptor family as a connection between the various pathways whose disruption may be involved in schizophrenia.

(p5.5) Rare variants (less than 5% of frequency in the population) may also take part in schizophrenia etiology.A genome wide study found increased proportion of rare variants in the schizophrenia subjects and analysis was enriched for genes expressed in fetal brain 39 .In another study of rare variations, no association was found for mutations in PTPRA gene and schizophrenia or autism, in spite of some variants found only in the people with the diseases may produce damage to protein production.PTPRA is believed to be critical to neurodevelopment and animal models support association with both autism and schizophrenia 40 .

(p5.6) Existing biomolecular methodologies permit the analysis not only of DNA, but also of its products.In the papers associated to neurodevelopment, one study concluded that GABA related mRNA disturbances in schizophrenia seem to not be related with illness chronicity, but may be the consequence of blunted or incomplete neurodevelopment 41 .The differences found between schizophrenia subjects and control go in the opposite direction of changes in expression during development (for example, vGAT, GAD 67 and parvalbumin mRNA levels increased during postnatal development, whereas they were decreased in schizophrenia subjects compared to control).However, since the study used post mortem brain sample of chronic patients, it cannot be ruled out that GABA related mRNA are disturbed during early stages of the disease.

(p5.7) Changes in mRNA Neuregulin 1, which is a recognized growth factor, during development have also been reported 42 .The authors describe the mRNA pattern from prenatal to old age of different NRG1 subtypes.Some SNPs of neuregulin increase the risk of schizophrenia in multiple populations and a specific polymorphism at NRG1 was associated with altered expression pattern of one NRG1 isoform in prenatal and early postnatal periods.Therefore, the link between genetic risk and the disease might be its interference in neurodevelopment trajectory of NRG1 mRNA subtypes.Moreover, diminished NRG1induced AKT phosphorylation in lymphoblast was associated with smaller hippocampal volume in firstepisode schizophrenia 43 .

(p5.8) FMR1 gene has also been studied in the context of schizophrenia 44 .This gene encodes for FMRP, which is the fragile X mental retardation protein (causative of a known inherited mental disability), but FMR1 mRNA levels did not differ between schizophrenia and control subjects.However, FMRP was decreased in schizophrenia and associated with lower IQ and early onset of illness, possibly due to abnormal translation or increased degradation.Another study replicated the finding of reduced FMRP levels and connected this result with reduced contrast sensitivity in schizophrenia subjects, perhaps by influencing visual pathway development 45 .Thus, FMRP reduced levels might represent the neurodevelopment feature of schizophrenia.

(p5.9) Transcriptome made on human induced pluripotent cell and neural progenitor cell from one patient with schizophrenia showed 228 genes altered only in the neural differentiation of the cells from the schizophrenia subject, from which ten were related to schizophrenia in previous studies and most are important to neurodevelopment or plasticity.Additionally, the authors performed a co expression analysis of these genes with data of adult brain samples of individuals with schizophrenia (compared to adult brain samples of control), from which some of the "hub genes" found exclusively on the schizophrenia group have also been associated with neural development disorders (such as CIT and LIN7A) 46 .

(p5.10) Epigenetic evidence supports the theory of neurodevelopment in schizophrenia.Complementary results were found in the studies, since the first found no difference in global DNA methylation between the twins tested 47 , but disease-associated differences at specific CpG islands; the second found a DNA globally hypomethylated with regions of hypermethylation 48 .Both performed pathway enrichment analysis, revealing pathways related to brain development, axon guidance, cell adhesion, metabolism and long-term potentiation.

(p5.11) In these studies, individual genes have also been implicated to the disease, such as: ST6GALNAC1 (hypomethylated) and Npas1 (hypermethylated).ST6GALNAC1 is known to be differentially regulated at key periods of neurodevelopment; Npas1 has already been described as an important mediator of neuron subtypes generation 49 in pre-natal brain development.

(p5.12) Some precautions must be taken when analyzing these results.Both used subjects in treatment and with chronic disease, which can affect the methylation pattern.Besides, both used small samples, which increase false negative results.

(p5.13) miRNA has also been implicated in schizophrenia pathology.In one study, the only miRNA that survived rigorous statistical analysis for differential expression in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of post mortem brain tissue 50 was miRNA-132, despite some others had already been related to schizophrenia in previous studies 51 .This miRNA is regulated by NMDA signaling and CREB/ERK pathway.

(p5.14) In the same study, authors identified negative association between miRNA-132 and mRNA from Dpyls3 and Dnmt3a, in different times during mouse brain development, as well as negative association between miRNA-132 and DNMT3A and GATA2 protein levels in culture cells.Therefore, Dpyls3, Dnmt3a and Gata2 are probable targets of miRNA-132, mainly during the adolescence period, when miRNA-132 levels increase.Described hypofunction of NMDA signaling (mediated by glutamate) in the disease and interaction between NMDAR and miRNA-132 may explain the abnormal miRNA-132 levels in schizophrenia.Indeed, mouse pups treated with NMDA antagonist (simulating what might happen in the disease) were found to have downregulated miRNA-132 and the effect remained in adulthood.This pattern may be related to the known NMDA "pruning" that occur in normal adolescence but may be deregulated in schizophrenia patients 52 .
## (s6) Limitations
(p6.0) Several limitations of this study and of the data interpretation must be considered.First, some of the studies used small samples, insufficient to avoid type I error.This is a known problem in the field of neurosciences and a recent review showed that the median statistical power in neuroscience is 21%, which can produce false negatives, results with low predictive positive value, and exaggerate the magnitude of the effect 53 .

(p6.1) Second, schizophrenia is a complex disorder and many authors consider it as a syndrome of different diseases 54 .Interestingly, several authors found subsets of schizophrenia patients with different biological behavior from the other, such as SNPs found only in a group of patients with worse performance or determined neuroimaging variance.Recently, it was proposed that rare variants were present in subgroups of patients and determined phenotypic distinct subtypes, for example carriers of variants in SLC39A13 showed severe negative symptoms and global cognition deficit, suggesting a subtype more related to development; carriers of ARMS/ KIDINS220 variants showed cognitive deficits and good educational attainment, suggesting degeneration over the years 55 .

(p6.2) The high variability among the patients complicates the generalization of genetic markers for the disease.One of the possible strategies used to overcome this difficulty is the use of endophenotypes, which are intermediate and measurable phenotypes filling the gap between the clinical manifestations of the psychiatric disorder and genetic 36 .However, this approach was considered only in a few articles.

(p6.3) Third, most of the evidence used case-control methodologies, but not patient cohorts.The cohort design permits to clearly calculate the relative risk of each genetic marker and its implications on neuroimaging, neurochemistry and cognitive decline described above.

(p6.4) Fourth, large scale studies are still hard to be interpreted.In GWASs, for example, despite statistical analysis provide a group of associated SNPs, their biological manifestations and implications cannot be assured and must be confirmed by posterior experiments.

(p6.5) Finally, the methodology used in this systematic review might have excluded studies possibly related to one of the theories, as only the papers with studies in humans were assessed and the quantity of studies found in each search was divergent.
