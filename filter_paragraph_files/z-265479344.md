Fields: Medicine

## (s1) Anti-oxidative effects
(p1.0) Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between oxidative and antioxidative processes in vivo (Sies, 2015).The overproduction of ROS and the release of a range of transcription factors that regulate oxidative stress are essential in triggering oxidative responses in ischemic cardiomyocytes (Kurian et al., 2016).
## (s2) Anti-apoptosis
(p2.0) Apoptosis is the process whereby cells "commit suicide" by activating an intracellular death program (Xu et al., 2019).Previous studies have shown that I/R can lead to cardiomyocyte death through a variety of pathways, including apoptosis (Wang et al., 2016).Salvianic acid A acts against apoptosis in injured cardiomyocytes through the activation of the PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 (Yin et al., 2013), RISK (Guan et al., 2013), and PAF/PAFR pathways and by weakening caspase-3 activity and increasing the Bcl-2:Bax ratio (Wang et al., 2021), thus reducing the release of downstream apoptotic factors, preventing the loss of cardiomyocytes, and minimizing the cardiac damage caused by MIRI.

(p2.1) Of note, the role of Salvianic acid A in alleviating MIRI appears to be linked to its anti-apoptotic pharmacological activity.Hu et al. (2016) first demonstrated that the combination of Salvianic acid A and hydroxyl safflower yellow A (HSYA) can exert antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects by activating the Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway to prevent myocardial cell damage.Salvianic acid A performs an important role in anti-apoptosis, and HSYA has an essential antioxidation role.Guan et al. (2013) compared the activities of several major active components in danhong injection in terms of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptosis properties and found that Salvianic acid A had strong anti-apoptotic effects.The results of such studies enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of function of Salvianic acid A in preventing and treating MIRI.
## (s3) Anti-inflammation
(p3.0) During cardiac ischemia, a large number of pro-inflammatory factors are released, causing the adhesion and migration of neutrophils and vascular endothelial cells, which eventually accumulate around myocardial tissue to release lysosomal enzymes, causing damage to myocardial cells and becoming a key factor inducing cardiac I/R injury (Qiu et al., 2018).
## (s4) Improvement of mitochondrial function
(p4.0) Mitochondria are the most important organelles supplying energy to cardiomyocytes.Damage to mitochondria during MI results in an insufficient energy supply.After reperfusion, mitochondria in ischemic tissue cannot quickly recover their normal form, and ischemic injury persists for a period before improvement occurs, aggravating myocardial cell injury and even causing death (Anzell et al., 2018).The stability of mitochondrial function is closely related to the mitochondrial membrane potential and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) (Griffiths, 2012).
## (s5) Regulation of autophagy
(p5.0) Autophagy is a key target in the treatment of I/R injury (Aghaei et al., 2019).Excessive autophagy in the myocardial I/R stage leads to the degradation of key proteases in the heart, resulting in increased cell death and aggravated heart injury (Lin et al., 2018).Several studies support the function of Salvianic acid A in the regulation of autophagy-related pathways.Fan et al. (2016) investigated the protective effect of Salvianic acid A on cardiomyocytes and cardiac I/R injury in an isolated rat heart model.Salvianic acid A pretreatment activated the targeted autophagy and apoptosis pathways through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), causing the downregulation of autophagy-related proteins including LC3-II, Beclin-1, and p62, thus alleviating MIRI.Furthermore, Xie et al. (2021) discovered that a novel Salvianic acid A derivative (DT-010) can alleviate oxidative stress-induced autophagy injury in cardiomyocytes via the AMPK-mTOR-Ulk1 signaling pathway and is a potential drug for use in the treatment of MIRI.
## (s6) Reduction of calcium overload
(p6.0) During MIRI, calcium overload can cause the generation and release of downstream active factors, induce harmful reactions in cells, and interact with inflammation, oxidative stress, and other mechanisms to cause or aggravate myocardial cell injury (Soares et al., 2019).

(p6.1) Salvianic acid A inhibits the influx of calcium ions at the cellular level.Lam et al. (2007) used a 5-HT precontracted rat model and found that Salvianic acid A had a cardioprotective effect on the heart by dilating coronary vasculature through inhibition of Ca 2+ influx in vascular smooth muscle.At the same time, Salvianic acid A has a regulatory effect on calcium channels.Salvianic acid A can block L-type calcium channel current on myocardial cell membranes (Song et al., 2016).It can also reduce the expression of calcium channel protein TRPC6 by inhibiting p-JNK, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ÎºB), and other signaling pathways, ultimately reducing Ca 2+ influx and the damage caused by calcium overload in myocardial cells (Meng et al., 2016).
## (s8) Anti-oxidative effects
(p8.0) After brain tissue ischemia, high amounts of ROS are produced rapidly and cause organelle damage, and the rapid recovery of blood oxygen supply during reperfusion directly leads to the second explosion of ROS generation, thus leading to brain reperfusion injury (Rodrigo et al., 2013).Salvianic acid A, as an oxygen free-radical scavenger, has an inhibitory effect on the overproduction of oxidation factors during CIRI.Yuan et al. (2010) found that in the cerebral cortex of model rats, Salvianic acid A can improve cerebral I/R injury by raising the activities of SOD and GSH-PX while decreasing xanthine oxidase activity and MDA expression to scavenge excessive ROS, reduce the level of cerebral oxidative stress, and alleviate cerebral infarction.Another study synthesized the hybrid of Tanshinol borneol ester (DBZ) with reference to traditional Chinese medicine theory and concluded that DBZ has antioxidant activity in I/R injury mouse models (Yuan et al., 2018).Specifically, DBZ can suppress lipid peroxidation, raise SOD and GSH-PX activities in model mouse brains, and reduce oxidative stress and MDA levels in the brain.
## (s11) Anti-apoptosis
(p11.0) Apoptosis is one of the crucial elements contributing to cerebral I/R (Tuo et al., 2022).Protecting ischemic core cells or penumbra cells from the interference of apoptosis signals is one of the common therapeutic strategies for cerebral I/R injury (Uzdensky, 2019).Salvianic acid A can also regulate some apoptosis signaling pathways in the brain.Several studies have found that intravenous injection of Salvianic acid A can inhibit caspase-3/7 activity by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to regulate the expression of apoptotic genes Bax and Bcl-2 (Guo et al., 2015), inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT1 and mTOR by activating AKT1 to reduce the rate of nerve cell apoptosis or improving the neurological dysfunction and pathological morphology in brain tissues of damaged areas, in turn alleviating cerebral ischemia tissue reperfusion injury (Yu et al., 2014;Yu et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2019).
## (s13) Protective effect of Salvianic acid A against renal I/R injury
(p13.0) With the increasing incidence of hematological malignancies, the frequency of renal I/R injury after kidney resection, kidney transplantation, and complex cardiovascular surgery has increased gradually (Chatauret et al., 2014).Renal I/R injury can also directly or indirectly cause kidney disease, including acute kidney injury, and delayed renal function transplantation, which has adverse postoperative consequences (Saat et al., 2016).
