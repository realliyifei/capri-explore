## (s5) RECOMMENDER SYSTEM CHALLENGES
(p5.0) The challenges in recommender systems can be classified into those related to the recommendations themselves, nature of the data and candidate generation.This is summarized in The key goal here in relevance to avoid noise and provide fresh recommendations.Challenges related to the nature of the data include cold start problem, imbalance and sparsity.When there is no history about the user to whom the recommendation is to be made or the item that is to be recommended, the recommender systems run into the 'cold start' problem.Funnily, the origin of the cold start problem was from cars in cold regions that had problems starting up and running till it reaches its optimum temperature.For recommender systems, this means that there are not enough historical interactions for item or user.Larger share of the ratings matrix is empty with no ratings for a user-item pair and this leads to the sparsity problem.Very few item-user combinations in the data matrix are minority class examples leading to the problem of imbalance.The last bucket of problem relates to candidate generation.

(p5.1) Creating an entry for all user-item combinations is an onerous task and it becomes necessary to generate pairs of users and items for training.For example: With 1 million videos and 100 million users, YouTube has a candidate generation problem as it cannot create an entry for every uservideo pair.(Covington, Adams, & Sargin, 2016).

## (s7) COLD START
(p7.0) Cold Start Problem is one of "Making recommendations where there are no prior interactions available for an user or an item" (Lam, Vu, & Le, 2008) The usual approach to solving the cold start problem is to include additional user features by combining content based and collaborative filtering based methods (Chiliguano & Fazekas, 2016).

## (s8) CANDIDATE GENERATION
(p8.0) If there are 1 million users and 0.3 million items, a data matrix at a user-item level would have 0.3 * 10^12 combinations as an input into a data mining algorithm to solve a classification or prediction task.Such a huge data matrix lends itself unviable from a computational and imbalance perspective.Hence candidate generation is an important problem in recommender systems.A summary of the methods in literature to solve the problem of candidate generation in deep learning is shown in Figure 3.2 YouTube used a candidate generation network (Covington et al., 2016) with inputs as events from user history.The problem of returning hundreds of videos from millions was treated as an extreme multi-class problem and is solved using a deep neural network that learnt the user embeddings as a function of the user's history and context.RNNs have been used for candidate generation for sequential data in Question-Answer Systems and deep keyphrase generation.In (Shen, Chen, & Huang, 2016), the authors turn to paraphrases as a means of capturing the way natural language expresses the information needed and present a general framework using a deep neural model which learns felicitous paraphrases for various tasks.In (Y.Weidong, 2018), first a list of phrase candidates with heuristic methods are returned followed by scoring each candidate phrase for its likelihood of being a keyphrase in the given document.

(p8.1) (Xiaonan Li, Li, & Yu, 2012) combined word embeddings with L2 regularized large scale logistic regression to search sentences similar to a query from Wikipedia articles and directly use the human-annotated entities in the similar sentences as candidate entities for the query.

(p8.2) Trivial business rule-based techniques and simple machine learning methods have been used combined with deep learning extensively in literature to create hybrid systems to solve the problem of candidate generation.In Google Apps, there are over a million apps in the database.

(p8.3) Every app cannot be scored for every query.Returning a short list of items that best match the query using various signals is achieved using a combination of machine learned methods and human defined rules (Cheng et al., 2016).Bloom Filter Chains have also been used for candidate generation for real-time tweet search involving sorting of tweets using a simple scoring function and then rescoring them with a separate component (Asadi & Lin, 2013).IBM Watson, a commercial tool calls out "Hypothesis Generation" as a key component and the same uses candidate generation to retrieve answers to a particular question (Chu-Carroll et al., 2012).
