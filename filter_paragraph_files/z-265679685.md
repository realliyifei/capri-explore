## (s5) Piezoelectric materials
(p5.0) Due to the application of the positive piezoelectric effect in signal pick-up, piezoelectric shunt damping technology is used in the passive control of automotive vibration noise.By using this principle, the current generated by the piezoelectric material is dissipated in the form of thermal energy, so that to convert mechanical energy into heat energy, thus achieving the suppression of mechanical vibration.In the literature [14], a 1:5 scale model was used to design different parallel shunt circuits for the excitation of vertical elastic vibrations in train carriages.
