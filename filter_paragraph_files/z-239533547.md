## (s11) Side effects of chemotherapy on the skin:
(p11.0) Because they target cells with accelerated division, chemotherapy drugs will affect any other type of cell that is undergoing rapid division.As a result, skin reactions are routinely developed during this type of treatment, as cancer cells and skin are subjected to accelerated processes of cell division [12].These skin reactions range from mild erythema to severe skin irritation and even epidermal necrosis.Most of these reactions are considered dose dependent.Patients often experience adverse skin effects such as xerosis, tenderness and dry skin [12].
