## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Quality of work life (QWL) is understood to be directly linked to an individual's level of satisfaction with the execution of his or her tasks, where satisfaction and wellbeing are indispensable aspects for the good functioning of a company. Numerous factors affect quality of life (QoL), among which we highlight as aspects interfering with QWL the environmental, family, health, and leisure conditions, as well as working conditions, since most of the active population spends part of their time in this environment. 1 Amorim 2 states that taking aspects related to workers' physical and mental health into consideration directly resonates with a company's level of productivity and success. This reinforces the importance of the implementation of QWL programs by employers, aiming to broaden employees' participation, satisfaction, and health, and thus obtaining increased productivity and profits for the company.
