## (s1) (Phyto)Estrogen Signaling in Wound Healing and Skin Aging
(p1.0) Menopause-induced estrogen deficiency is accompanied by changes in skin morphology and physiology involving decrease in thickness, collagen, and water content as well as loss of elasticity and increase in fragility [13][14][15].Lower estrogen levels associated with the menopause also result in impaired wound healing.In particular, the negative effect of the menopause on wound healing results from fragile skin that tears and bruises easily and is thus susceptible to trauma [16].
## (s2) Inflammatory Phase and Oxidative Stress
(p2.0) Inflammation is a crucial process involved in wound healing.During the inflammatory phase the innate immune response is activated leading to the recruitment of immune cells to the injury site and removal of invading pathogens and dead cells/tissues [38].

(p2.1) The imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling has a crucial influence on the morphological and functional outcome of scarring [39].In particular, prolonged/chronic inflammation may cause deregulation of keratinocyte and fibroblast differentiation/activation which may in turn lead to disturbance in the wound healing process.frequently resulting in excessive scar formation [40].Intriguingly, despite inappropriately excessive inflammatory response associated with age-related delayed wound healing [41], the menopause is rather associated with reduced scarring and ECM deposition [13,42].The effect of genistein on inflammatory phase of wound healing and oxidative stress is shown in Figure 1.
## (s4) Proliferation Phase
(p4.0) The proliferative phase of wound repair involves formation of the granulation tissue including fibroblast proliferation, ECM deposition, angiogenesis, and wound reepithelization [64].In particular, several menopause-associated fibroblast malfunctions were reported in elderly women.The underlying mechanisms include microRNA-7 up-regulation, impaired function of EGF receptor, hyaluronan synthase 2, resulting in Januse kinase (JAK)/STAT1 over-activation [65].In this context estrogen down-regulates microRNA-7 expression which attenuates STAT1 and also induces a rapid re-organization of the cytoskeleton in dermal fibroblast via the non-genomic GPR30 axis [66,67].The effect of genistein on proliferation phase of wound healing is shown in Figure 2.

(p4.1) stored its function in the early stages of wound healing [46].Additionally, genistein reduced oxidative stress in diabetic mice through suppression of iNOS and forkhead box O transcription factor 1 (FoxO1) activity.This resulted not only in alleviation of delayed wound healing but also in improved angiogenesis [62].Protection against oxidative stress in skin was also observed in male rats fed with an isoflavone mixture of genistein and daidzein (2 or 20 mg/kg).The isoflavone mixture-treated group showed significantly greater thickness of the skin epidermis as well as higher amounts of collagen and elastic fibers in the dermis.Skin homogenates of the treated group showed a decrease in catalase activity and inhibited lipid peroxide formation in a dose dependent manner [63].
## (s5) Proliferation Phase
(p5.0) The proliferative phase of wound repair involves formation of the granulation tissue including fibroblast proliferation, ECM deposition, angiogenesis, and wound re-epithelization [64].In particular, several menopause-associated fibroblast malfunctions were reported in elderly women.The underlying mechanisms include microRNA-7 up-regulation, impaired function of EGF receptor, hyaluronan synthase 2, resulting in Januse kinase (JAK)/STAT1 over-activation [65].In this context estrogen down-regulates microRNA-7 expression which attenuates STAT1 and also induces a rapid re-organization of the cytoskeleton in dermal fibroblast via the non-genomic GPR30 axis [66,67].The effect of genistein on proliferation phase of wound healing is shown in Figure 2.
## (s9) Epidermis Regeneration
(p9.0) Wound re-epithelization is a crucial process in rebuilding the mechanical barrier between the outer and inner environments.Estrogen also imparts a potent mitogenic effect on keratinocytes, promoting in vitro and in vivo migration [95], which might be affected by the estrogen-mediated ER-β interaction with keratinocytes.ER-β led to an increase in cell proliferation and keratin-19 expression, as well as a decrease in galectin-1 expression.Fittingly, in rat wounds treated with the ER-β agonist, epidermal regeneration was accelerated.In the present study, we provide information on the nuclear ER-β through which selective estrogen receptor agonists affect the expression pattern of selected markers, thus modulating keratinocyte proliferation (increased Ki67 expression) and differentiation (increased keratin 19 expression) [96].In addition, we demonstrated that the pharmacological activation of ER-α and -β has a different impact on wound healing [96,97].

(p9.1) Genistein among other phytoestrogen-containing extracts modulated the differentiation pattern of keratinocytes (HaCaT) and estrogen positive breast cancer cells (MCF-7).Interestingly, phytoestrogen treatment was shown to increase the expression of luminal marker keratin-8 in MCF-7, but not in HaCaT cells, whereas the expression of other keratins (i.e., 14 and 19) remained rather stable in both used cell lines [98].Furthermore, estrogen accelerated skin wound healing by promoting keratinocyte proliferation via non-genomic ERK/Akt signaling [99].Genistein was shown to stimulate hyaluronic acid production in keratinocytes culture in vitro and in vivo [100].
## (s10) Maturation and Remodeling Phase
(p10.0) It is well known that abnormalities in wound repair range from non-healing wounds to excessive fibrosis and scarring.Excessive deposition of ECM components and collagens during the maturation/remodeling phase of wound healing may lead to development of hypertrophic scars or keloids.In comparison to hypertrophic scars, which do not grow beyond the boundaries of the wound site, keloids often grow beyond the original extent of the wound.However, both hypertrophic scars and keloids may cause physiological and psychological discomfort [101].Hypertrophic scar, a more common form of excessive scarring, is often a result of surgical procedures, trauma, radiation, or burn injuries.Although, the exact mechanism of keloid and hypertrophic scar development is not known, various cytokines have been shown to be implicated including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TGF-β as well as various growth factors including for example PDGF [101].The effect of genistein on maturation phase of wound healing is shown in Figure 2.

(p10.1) In hypertrophic scars, genistein at high concentration (100 µM) was shown to be capable of arresting fibroblast proliferation and suppressing collagen production.On the contrary, normal skin fibroblasts were not affected, which indicates action specificity.In detail, the anti-proliferative effect of genistein was mediated through inhibition of Rat sarcoma (Ras), Rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (Raf), ERK, and p38 proteins involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway [28].Furthermore, in rat cardiac fibroblasts, genistein was shown to inhibit proliferation through GPR30 signaling by suppression of the cell cycle proteins, cyclin B1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1(CDK1) [27].

(p10.2) Abnormal scarring can also result in keloid formation, characterized by imbalanced ECM synthesis and degradation.One of the features observed in keloids is abnormal activity of transcription factor AP-1 (activator protein 1) connected with disturbed expression of its subunits (c-Fos, c-Jun).In cooperation with other transcription factors, AP-1 induces expression of MMPs and regulates expression of growth factors and cytokines [102].The expression of C-JUN was higher in keratinocytes treated with both tested concentrations of genistein (37 and 370 µM).On the other hand, in fibroblasts, genistein regulated C-JUN expression in a dose-dependent manner.In normal dermal fibroblasts a lower tested concentration of genistein resulted in higher C-JUN expression whereas in keloid fibroblasts C-JUN expression was more increased at the higher tested concentration of genistein.Genistein at higher tested concentration inhibited C-FOS expression in normal fibroblasts, but the expression of C-FOS was stimulated in keloid fibroblasts in a concentration dependent manner.Of note, genistein, at 370 and 37 µM, inhibited FOS-B expression in keratinocytes [103].

(p10.3) When compared to normal fibroblasts, keloid fibroblasts express higher amounts of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) on mRNA and protein levels.Genistein was shown to be able to decrease CTGF expression on both levels in a dose dependent manner.Moreover, genistein was also capable of attenuating TGFβ1, β2, and β3 gene expression.Interestingly, the cytoprotective effect of genistein was revealed due to Bcl-2 gene expression stimulation [104].Furthermore, it was also described in HMVEC-d cells, that the genistein induced Bcl-2 production is mediated rather via ER-β [60].
