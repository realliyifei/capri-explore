## (s8) Remark 10. The Equation (39) is easily solved multiplying by an integrating factor
(p8.0) where s 0 > 0 is an arbitrary integration limit chosen so that the integral converges (the formula (40) appeared first in [AU08]). To simplify, we may choose s 0 = 0 to integrate the first part α 0 z + c − Π(z), and a different lower bound s 0 = 1 to integrate q/z. Putting q = q r ,c = c r , α 0 = α 0 r , we get that 

(p8.1) where we replaced s 0 by · to indicate that two different lower bounds are in fact used, and we put I(s) = I 0 (s) (the subscript 0 will be omitted when q = 0).
## (s14) Asmussen's Embedding Approach for Solving Kolmogorov's Integro-Differential Equation with Phase-Type Jumps
(p14.0) One of the most convenient approaches to get rid of the integral term in (15) is a probabilistic transformation which gets rid of the jumps as in [Asm95], when the downward phase-type jumps have a survival function

(p14.1) where B is a n × n stochastic generating matrix (nonnegative off-diagonal elements and nonpositive row sums), β = (β 1 , . . . , β n ) is a row probability vector (with nonnegative elements and n j=1 β j = 1), and 1 = (1, 1, ..., 1) is a column probability vector. The density is f C (x) = βe −Bx b, where b = (−B)1 is a column vector, and the Laplace transform isb
