## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) In the adult population, approximately 10% of major trauma victims are estimated to harbour a spinal fracture/dislocation, and 2% to suffer from a spinal cord injury, with or without a fracture/dislocation (Hasler et al., 2011). Such patients are in their majority (60%) young healthy males, in their most productive age, and the spinal injury can cause devastating social and economic impact due to impaired mobility and neurological deficits of varying severity (Ahsan et al., 2019;van Den Hauwe et al., 2020;Kumar et al., 2018;Sekhon and Fehlings, 2001).
## (s8) Discussion
(p8.0) Our survey demonstrates significant variability in the adherence to the explored recommendations for spinal trauma. This was coupled to disparities of income and to locoregional/geographical variation. Previous studies also showed a lower rate of adherence in LMICs than in HICs to some guidelines for the management of spinal trauma, mainly in the pre-hospital phases of treatment (Lepard et al., 2022).
