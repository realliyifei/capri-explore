## (s4) Plastics Dissolved in Conventional Refinery
(p4.0) Streams. The direct cofeeding of plastics dissolved in conventional refinery streams (vacuum gasoil, VGO) has the advantage of not requiring additional pyrolysis facilities. However, this direct strategy shows several drawbacks: (i) a rigorous separation of polyolefinic plastics must be carried out in municipal solid waste collection and segregation points; (ii) plastics must be transported to the refineries, which is not an easy task given their low density; (iii) plastics must be dissolved in refinery streams. In short, a non-normalized and difficult to obtain feedstock would have to be handled in the refinery.

(p4.1) The first reference in the literature about catalytic cracking in a fixed bed MAT type reactor by feeding VGO blended with HDPE (5 and 10 wt %) at 510Â°C reports a substantial production of gasoline from the HDPE plastic contained in the feed (10 wt %). 192 Later, the cracking of polyolefins and polyaromatics under conditions similar to those of the industrial unit was studied on a riser simulator reactor with different types of catalysts: (i) equilibrated commercial FCC catalysts; 193,194 (ii) commercial fresh catalysts and other inhouse synthesized HY zeolite-based catalysts with different porous structures and acidities; 195,196 (iii) catalysts prepared in the laboratory using HZSM-5 zeolites as additives. 195 The solvents used in these studies for dissolving the plastic were VGO, which is the current FCC unit feed, and light cycle oil (LCO), which is a product stream of the FCC unit with a high content of aromatics.
