(p0.0) In normal physiological conditions, the metabolism of oxygen in aerobic organisms leads to the generation of dangerous and very reactive compounds, known as free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Meier, 2001;Lim et al., 2002), including superoxide radical (O 2
## (s2) Selenium in blood components and Se metabolites in urine of healthy individuals
(p2.0) Kidneys play an important role in the homeostasis of selenium (Se) (Lockitch, 1989;Neve, 1991).When Se is consumed at rates close to the human nutritional requirement, its highest level is found in kidneys and then in the liver (Combs & Combs, 1984).It has been shown that the amount of Se in the kidney, calculated per wet mass, is 1.4 to about 3 times higher than in the liver and 6.6 to 10 times higher than in skeletal muscles (Zachara et al., 2001b).The Se level in tissues/organs depends on its daily intake, the chemical form of ingested Se and probably on other unknown factors (Lockitch, 1989;Alaejos & Romero, 1993).Thus the tissue Se level in people from seleniferous regions is much higher than in those living in low Se areas (Zachara et al., 2001b).
## (s3) 1) O
(p3.0) In 1969, Byard was the first to identify a urinary Se metabolite as trimethylselenonium ion (TMSe).Almost at the same time Palmer et al. (1969;1970) identified TMSe as the major Se metabolite in rat urine.These authors have shown that TMSe is a common urinary metabolite from all tested Se sources and constituted 20-50% of the urinary Se.The TMSe level in urine has been generally thought to increase when Se exposure is above the nutritional requirement.This Se metabolite was later found in human urine (cf.Francesconi & Pannier, 2004).Se metabolism in mammals and its transformation into methylated forms are shown in Fig. 2. (Medina et al., 2001).
