## (s3) Robotic Exoskeletons and Orthoses
(p3.0) Robots are in a general definition multi-purpose handling devices that not only perform one task but can also be adapted to solve other tasks by being programmable and being equipped with various tools. Often a distinction is made between robots with fixed work sequences such as classical industrial robots, robots that can perform several specific tasks in variable sequence, playback or teach-in robots whose motion sequences are demonstrated by an operator, stored, and can be replayed, numerically controlled robots for which the operator can flexibly program various motion sequences, and generally "intelligent" robots. Intelligent robots perceive their environment via sensors and interpret this via various algorithms and (learned) models to solve tasks even if something changes in the environment. In the definition of autonomous robots, some of the aforementioned categories are combined. Autonomous robots move independently and complete a not exactly defined task without human assistance by calculating or learning solutions.

(p3.1) Robotic orthoses and exoskeletons, i.e., active systems, that can move independently via motors can either be assigned to one of the mentioned subgroups of robots or even fulfil several criteria of different subgroups. Very complex systems can include both simple algorithms that adapt their own movement, for example, by taking out their own weight or the weight of parts of the human body 2 in the sense of gravitational compensation, or more complex control approaches that allow one part of the system to control another part, for example, one arm or leg controls the other [21,54]. In the same system, in another mode, the movements can be trained by a therapist in the sense of a teach-in and then repeated automatically or triggered by the recognition of the person's intention to move from, e.g., their residual muscle activity, 3 eye movement, or brain activity [21]. The latter requires an intelligent interface, such as a BCI, which can be part of the intelligent robotic exoskeleton or orthoses [55]. In teleoperation, intelligent bidirectional exoskeletons can not only transmit movements from the human to the robot but also feedback tactile information to the operator [10].
## (s5) Intention Recognition Using Multimodal Data
(p5.0) The perception of intentions is particularly important in the context of neuromotor rehabilitation [17,18] or ADL support by an exoskeleton [75][76][77]. An intelligent exoskeleton must recognize the patient's intention, e.g., where he or she wants to move [78,79]. But also in other applications, such as teleoperation, it can be relevant to understand what a user's intentions are. For example, using the human electroencephalogram (EEG) can help to detect the movement intention to increase the sensitivity of the force sensors that recognizes interaction forces between human and exoskeleton for more transparent behavior [8].
