## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Climate change is the main issue facing the current ecological environment. An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report states that climate change is an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human society and the planet [1]. For example, the drought caused by climate change has led to a decrease in photosynthesis in the Amazon forest, which has reduced the total absorption of CO 2 by forests [2]. Similarly, drought increases the vulnerability of older forests, and only low bushes may continue to survive, which will change the global carbon cycle [3]. Due to climate warming, the spread of viruses and the possibility of infection will increase, bringing more disease risks to the ecosystem [4]. More seriously, climate change may bring the extinction of certain species and affect biodiversity [5]. However, climate change will also have a positive impact on different ecosystems. For example, because low temperature limits the growth of vegetation in high latitudes and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), climate warming promotes the growth of vegetation in these areas to a certain extent, and climate change has increased the global leaf area index (LAI), which has resulted in a greening trend range exceeding 28.4% of the global vegetation area [6]. In short, climate change affects the sustainable development of global ecosystems and human society, and as such, increasingly more people are paying attention to this issue.
## (s7) The Impact of Human Activities on the Carbon Balance
(p7.0) Human activities have a direct and indirect impact on carbon balance. A certain amount of carbon dioxide is produced by human production and life, and a higher carbon dioxide level in the air will further warm the climate, increasing the temperature by 0.1 • C to 1.5 • C [7]. Most of the above experiments and models do not consider the impact of human activities when projecting the carbon balance. However, the change of land use caused by human activities leads to the change of the ecological environment and local climate [106][107][108], which in turn affects the terrestrial carbon emissions [109]. Therefore, when projecting the carbon balance projection of grassland ecosystems in the QTP under the climate change scenario, the factor of human activity should be added. Current studies of the effects of human activities on the carbon balance on the QTP include grazing and wetland drainage.
## (s8) Grazing
(p8.0) Grazing activities have a certain impact on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems, where different degrees of grazing intensity (light grazing, medium grazing, and heavy grazing) and grazing duration have different impacts on the carbon balance [110,111]. Grazing is a typical form of human activity on the QTP. With the increase of grazing intensity, the aboveground and underground biomass is gradually reduced, and the carbon content of alpine soil also decreases [112,113]. This can also be seen in the effects of different grazing management systems (fencing, rest of grazing in growth stages, traditional grazing, and continuous grazing). The higher the grazing intensity is, the lower the carbon content in the soil will be. Conversely, when the grazing intensity is weakened, the carbon content in the soil will gradually recover. The study showed that short-term fallow grazing could restore vegetation growth of slightly degraded alpine meadows. On the one hand, recreational grazing reduces vegetation without being affected by livestock; on the other hand, recreational grazing promotes the growth of perennial vegetation and increases the carbon content of the ecosystem [114].
