## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) During the last years a far reaching theory on band-dominated operators grew up and revealed deep results concerning their Fredholm property, their spectral properties, the applicability (and further side effects) of the finite section method, and was successfully applied to several more concrete subclasses of operators having more advanced properties. Among them one can find Toeplitz, Hankel or Jacobi operators, hence also discrete Schroedinger operators.

(p0.1) Besides, the wonderful concept of operator algebras arising from approximate projections and the limit operator method were developed. Today one may say that large parts of this theory are very well understood and finalized. However, there are some results which still require some additional assumptions that seem to be redundant but could not be removed completely yet. One prominent example is the need for a predual setting in case of band-dominated operators on l ∞spaces in the works of Lindner. A collection of eight open problems was stated by Chandler-Wilde and Lindner in the final chapter of [3].
## (s12) All limit operators of
(p12.0) Let us now again turn our attention to the (classical) Fredholm property and the proof of Theorem 3. In fact, our arguments follow in large parts those of the original ones [7], just profit from the new and improved results of Section 2, and use an alternative construction of Fredholm operators of prescribed index that does not require the hyperplane property of X. We start with an auxiliary lemma.

(p12.1) Lemma 24. For every κ ∈ Z there exists an operator S κ ∈ W which is Fredholm on l p = l p (Z N , X) of index κ for every p ∈ {0} ∪ [1, ∞].
## (s13) Collective compactness and Favard's condition
(p13.0) Chandler-Wilde and Lindner [2] have studied another more concrete class of band-dominated operators on l ∞ (Z, X) for which the Fredholm criteria become much simpler in the sense that already the injectivity of all of their limit operators is sufficient for the Fredholmness of such operators.

(p13.1) Definition 26. We say that an operator A on l ∞ (Z, X) is subject to Favard's condition if every limit operator of A is injective on l ∞ (Z, X).
## (s17) Extensions and Generalizations
(p17.0) One-sided definitions In [3] it is also discussed whether one can weaken and replace the definitions of K(X, P), L(X, P) and P-strong convergence by one sided analogues (see the Open Let us consider the following example which illustrates that weakening the definition of K(X, P) necessitates also the modification of L(X, P) and the notion of convergence:

(p17.1) Example 32. Let ψ : L p (0, 1) → L p (R) be an isometric Banach space isomorphism. As an example one may take the following construction: The mapping

(p17.2) is an isometry, and its inverse mapping is (φ −1 g)(s) = s −1/p g(− log s), s > 0. The same holds true for the restriction φ : L p (0, 1) → L p (R + ). Thus ψ := φ • φ : L p (0, 1) → L p (R) does the job. Now, let X := l p (Z, L p (0, 1)) and define B ∈ L(X) by

(p17.3) Clearly B is an isometric isomorphism between im P 0 and X, B belongs to SN (X), but Q n BP 0 does not tend to zero as n → ∞. Thus, we see that SN (X) is not a subset of L(X, P), hence would not serve as an ideal there. Moreover, (A n − A)B → 0 would always imply A n − A → 0, so a two-sided definition of convergence based on SN (X) instead of K(X, P) would be nothing but the usual norm convergence.

(p17.4) The motivation for such modified definitions is obvious: One can now try to develop an analogous theory for the larger family S(X) ⊃ L(X, P). To be more concrete, one may ask which of the results of Section 2 translate to this more general setting and, in particular, whether there is an analogous Fredholm and limit operator theory available.
## (s18) Conclusions
(p18.0) Within this paper we have presented an overview of the recent state of the art in Fredholm theory for band-dominated and related operators which is based on the beautiful and most complete Papproach. It turned out that replacing the classical functional analytic approach and the notions of compactness, Fredholmness and strong convergence by the respective P-triple provides a Banach algebraic framework which perfectly fits to the problems one is interested in. It permits to treat the whole scale of spaces l p (Z N , X) (and even more) in a completely homogeneous way. In fact, there is no need for reflexivity, for a predual setting (1), for the hyperplane property of X (2), or for any other restrictions on X, e.g. on its dimension. We have particularly answered the Open Problems No. 4 and 5 of [3]. Moreover, the conjectures No. 7 (Sufficiency of Favards condition for N > 1) and 3 (inverse closedness of S(X) turned out to be wrong. We have also seen that the important partial answers to the big question (Problem No. 8) actually hold for all rich operators in the framework L(l p , P), p ∈ {0, 1, ∞}, and are not specific for band-dominated operators.

(p18.1) Concerning the Open Problems No. 1 and 2 we could make the following observations: The passage from the classical approach to L(X, P) turned out to be a great step. The algebraic and topological structures and relations remained essentially the same, this P-framework is consistent and self-contained, and one could achieve a much higher flexibility and generality. Also the proofs became more transparent. The possible next step towards S(X) and s-convergence is less promising since several important basic results which are necessary for a Fredholm theory and the limit operator method cannot be extended in general, and will not provide a comparable toolbox.
