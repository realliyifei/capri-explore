## (s9) Physical Treatment Method
(p9.0) Physical treatment methods include processes where no gross chemical or biological changes are carried out and strictly physical phenomena are used to improve or treat the wastewater.This is the primary treatment step, which is essential to remove or separate suspended solids (SS), immiscible liquids, solid particles, suspended substances from petroleum wastewater by using sedimentation, coagulation and flocculation and prolonged use of the secondary treatment unit (Renault et al., 2009).There are different types of physical treatment method, such as;
## (s14) Chemical Treatment Method
(p14.0) Chemical treatment method is a process of using chemical reactions or reaction to increase the water superiority.A chemical process is commonly used in many industrial wastewater treatment operations is neutralization.

(p14.1) Neutralization is a process of adding an acid or base to adjust pH levels back to neutrality (Aljuboury et al., 2017).Since lime is a base it is sometimes used in the neutralization of acid wastes.
## (s15) Biological Treatment Method
(p15.0) Biological treatment is the use of microorganisms, mostly bacteria, in the biochemical decomposition of wastewaters to stable end products.More microorganisms, or sludge's are formed and a portion of the waste is converted to carbon dioxide, water and other end products (Zhao et al., 2006).The biological oxidation processes depend on the compositions of the petroleum wastewater.However, these processes have some disadvantages such as the extreme sludge production, and low capacity to COD removals (Jou and Huang, 2003).Generally, biological https://journals.e-palli.com/home/index.php/jirJ. Innov.Res.1(1) 04-11, 2023 treatment methods can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic methods, based on availability of dissolved oxygen (Zhao et al., 2006).The aerobic process converts the organic compounds and recalcitrant components in wastewater into CO 2 and water and solid biological products.While anaerobic systems, the products of chemical and biochemical reactions produce displeasing colors and odors in water.Thus, the oxygen availability was important in water to reduce displeasing colors and odors (Attiogbe et al., 2007).Decomposition of organic compounds through living systems (i.e.bacteria, algae, plants).Usually safe and low cost, the disadvantage is the high production of sludge when compared to the volume of water treated.
