## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common form of inflammatory rheumatological disease, affecting 0.5-1% of the population and leading to major socioeconomic consequences [1,2]. It represents a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory process predominantly of the synovial joints, which leads to early progressive irreversible osteo-articular damage, significant functional deficit, secondary osteoarthritis, and even the need for orthopedic surgical interventions (such as total arthroplasty of the hips [3] and knees). It is frequently associated with serious extra-articular systemic manifestations that lead to a 5-10-year reduction in life expectancy [1,2].

(p0.1) One of the factors contributing to the decrease in life expectancy in RA are psychiatric disorders-of which mood disturbances such as depression are the most frequent [4]. Depression is very frequently associated with RA, and it takes a big toll on the patient's quality of life, making it a very important health problem. Taking into account the current treatment strategies in RA, like "treat-to-target" and "tight control", the best approach would probably be to also address depression for the best possible outcome of RA patients.

(p0.2) The current article is a narrative review on depression in RA, with the objective to emphasize and raise awareness on the high prevalence, pathogenic mechanisms, and effects that depression has on RA patients. As the literature search revealed, the current review is the only narrative review that incorporates the prevalence and diagnostic difficulties of depression in rheumatoid arthritis with the mechanistic pathways of depression in RA, as well as the effects it has on this category of patients, with the objective to grasp this comorbidity from all points of view.
## (s4) Prevalence of Depression in RA
(p4.0) In the general population, depression has a prevalence of 6% [5]. However, in RA, the prevalence of depression has been shown to be 2-3 times higher than in the general population, with a meta-analysis reporting that 16.8% of RA patients have a major depressive disorder [6]. Furthermore, a cross-sectional study showed that depression was more prevalent in RA than in patients with diabetes, cancer, and Parkinson's disease [7]. This finding may be related to several factors that make patients with RA more vulnerable to developing depression, such as chronic pain and physical disability leading to inability to work, as well as potential side-effects from disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and glucocorticoids [7].
## (s5) Challenges in Defining Depression in RA Patients
(p5.0) In clinical practice, differentiating between patients with depressive disorders and the adequate reaction has proven to be challenging in patients with chronic debilitating diseases. Furthermore, patients with RA also have constitutional manifestations like fatigue, weight loss, insomnia, and lack of appetite, which overlap with the symptoms of depression. Moreover, our literature search revealed no studies attempting to differentiate the spectrum of depression in RA patients, namely to discriminate between depressive symptoms, depressive syndromes, and depression as a unique nosological entity (unipolar mood disorder).

(p5.1) The gold standard of detecting depression is the psychiatric interview and diagnosis according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) criteria [9], which are time consuming, expensive, and not ideal for assessing patients in a busy medical environment. However, in clinical research studies on the prevalence of depression [10,11], this is more often defined by using self-reported screening questionnaires, which are quicker, easier to complete, and cheaper. Compared to the gold-standard, self-reported questionnaires may result in the overestimation of prevalence, as screening tools tend to prioritize sensitivity over specificity due to low predefined thresholds for diagnosis [9].

(p5.2) A meta-analysis from 2013 showed that one of the main problems with using selfreported patient questionnaires is the variability in defining the term 'depression', with more than 40 encountered definitions [10,11]. This emphasizes the need for screening tools to be validated against a clinical interview as the gold standard in order to assess depressive symptoms [12]. The present article was not able to investigate whether other diseases or specific drugs were used as exclusion criteria for the diagnosis of depression based on self-reported screening questionnaires.

(p5.3) A meta-analysis on depression definitions in RA patients showed that some of the screening tools used to detect depression are Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Inventory to Diagnose Depression (IDD), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the most frequently used being the HADS and the CESD. The definition of depression based on these questionnaires included possible or probable positive diagnosis by using either one or multiple thresholds [13]. For example, the CESD, one of the most commonly used questionnaires, was used with 9 different cut-off points. Additionally, when using the HADS measure, the range of estimates for depression was between 14.8% and 48% due to the use of variable cut-off scores [14].

(p5.4) Moreover, not only is there variability between studies using the same self-reported questionnaire, but there is also a large overlap between systemic RA symptoms indicating disease activity and depression symptoms [14]. Therefore, no single tool should be favored for depression assessment in RA patients [15], and all screening tools need clinical diagnostic confirmation [16].

(p5.5) Future studies are needed to determine the most accurate self-reported depression questionnaires and their ideal threshold for defining depression as compared to the goldstandard for patients with RA in order to allow better comparisons across studies.
## (s7) Inflammatory Mechanisms
(p7.0) RA is a well-known immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by high levels of major proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and IL6, suggesting dysregulations between the innate and adaptive (auto) immune system pathophysiology [19].

(p7.1) It has been shown that systemic inflammation may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms during different disorders of chronic inflammation, such as diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [14]. The pathogenesis of depression remains to be fully understood, but recent literature suggests that immune-mediated processes are involved [20]. This has been supported by meta-analyses showing high levels of the same proinflammatory cytokines like RA (IL6, IL1β, and TNFα) in the peripheral blood of patients with depression compared with controls [21]. The role of these cytokines in depression is supported by the similarities between the symptoms of cytokine-induced sickness behavior and depression such as behavioral inhibition, anorexia, weight loss, anhedonia, psychosomatic symptoms, anxiety, and neurocognitive symptoms [22].
## (s10) Effect of Inflammation on Neurotransmission
(p10.0) It is a well-known fact that low serotonin levels are correlated with depressive symptoms [31]. Inflammation has been shown to decrease serotonin availability within the CNS or the brainstem through either lack of its precursor, tryptophan, or increased serotonin transporter activity. In inflammatory diseases, TNFα expression is increased, leading to high levels of the serotonin transporter, which lowers serotonin levels in the brainstem. As mentioned above, TNFα levels are increased in RA patients [17].

(p10.1) Moreover, in immune-mediated inflammation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is upregulated and is an enzyme that leads to the breakdown of tryptophan. The breakdown products of tryptophan can have both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects. The ratio of breakdown products is skewed in inflammatory conditions towards neurotoxic effects. This pattern correlates with mood disorders [17]. In inflammation, the IDO pathway is also upregulated in mature dendritic cells, leading to reverse signaling to regulatory T-cells contributing to autoimmunity [32].

(p10.2) Another important molecule for neurotransmission and neuroprotection is brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Inflammation has been shown to decrease its levels and its effects on neurogenesis. RA animal models showed that these changes are associated with depression [33]. Furthermore, in rat models, anti-TNF medication DMARDs like etanercept have been shown to increase hippocampal BDNF [34].
## (s11) Structural Changes in RA Patients with Depression
(p11.0) Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown how peripheral inflammation, a hallmark of RA, affects the structure and connectivity of the brain. Schrepf and colleagues found altered patterns of brain connectivity in RA patients with higher levels of disease activity, as well as evidence of inflammation-associated subnetwork reorganization [35].

(p11.1) Other studies looking at depression using whole-brain analysis showed that CRP and inflammatory cytokine levels were associated with decreased connectivity within the reward-related brain regions [36]. Moreover, depressive symptoms, such as low mood, fatigue, and anxiety have been shown to decrease whole brain network efficiency due to IFN-α effects on brain connectivity [37]. However, IFN-α induced fatigue has been shown to behave differently to inflammation on other MRI studies. Basal ganglia may be more sensitive to IFN-α and may be responsible for fatigue in this context. Regardless of the mechanism for fatigue in patients with RA, it has been shown that fatigue and pain can produce and aggravate depression. This could be through shared pathophysiology or through their association with disability and lower QoL [17].

(p11.2) Other neuroimaging human studies support an effect of systemic inflammation on areas that are central to affective control and regulation, such as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC), leading to mood changes. Furthermore, it has been shown that peripheral inflammation leads to changes in substantia nigra function and the generation of sickness symptoms, such as psychomotor slowing [38].

(p11.3) Further imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, have shown that IFN-α increases glutamate levels in the dorsal cingulate in patients with high inflammation and mood disorders. This suggests that proinflammatory cytokines are responsible for the depressive symptoms found in patients with RA [39].

(p11.4) In summary, this data suggest that similarities exist between the neural networks recruited in inflammation and those implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. RA has been clearly associated with a high prevalence of depression, but recent epidemiological studies imply a bidirectional relationship between these two entities, suggesting patients with depression are also at high risk of developing RA [40]. Therefore, the fact that depression and RA might share a pathogenetic pathway is plausible. Besides sharing common biological pathogenic pathways, the appearance of depression in RA patients does not create a passive association, but it influences the clinical characteristics and the secondary outcomes of RA, as shown in the following sections.
## (s12) Effects of Depression in RA Patients
(p12.0) Depression in patients with RA is associated with poor long-term outcomes. Multiple studies have shown that depression in RA is associated with increased pain, fatigue, and physical disability. This alters treatment compliance, causes more comorbidities, and leads to higher mortality, partly through increased suicide risk. Depression in RA increases health service utilization and healthcare costs directly through hospitalization, but also indirectly through loss of work productivity. It also considerably decreases quality of life (QoL) for RA patients, a fact that is reflected in all domains of QoL questionnaires [41]. Additionally, psychological distress may impact health outcomes by influencing other health behaviors alongside medication adherence, such as smoking and physical activity. Reduced levels of physical activity can result in deconditioning, loss of natural endorphins, and increased pain [13].
## (s13) Depression and Altered Pain Perception
(p13.0) Mood disorders, like depression and anxiety, have been incriminated as potential factors for relapse periods in RA patients [42], and they significantly alter the way patients perceive their current health. Patients' perception of their overall health (global health) is independently and negatively associated with depression. Patients with RA who perceive their health to be poor or who see themselves as disabled, be it related or not to their RA diagnosis, tend to experience high levels of depression [43].
## (s17) Depression Increases Healthcare Resource Utilization
(p17.0) Depression in RA can also increase healthcare resource utilization, which can lead to high health care expenditures for both insurance payers, patients, and families. The burden of depression has high socioeconomic costs including workplace absenteeism and presenteeism, and workplace productivity is associated with functional disability and depressive symptoms [12]. Moreover, the presence of depression along with any chronic physical condition more than doubles the likelihood of work absenteeism as compared to the presence of any chronic physical condition without depression [58].
## (s18) Discussion
(p18.0) Depression is highly prevalent in RA, and the toll it takes on the quality of life of patients suggests that in routine clinical practice and corresponding follow-up procedures, patients should be screened for the presence of depressive symptoms [5]. Diagnosing and treating depression in this category of patients should be part of standard patient care, but that implies using validated screening questionnaires against the gold standard for detecting depression. A full diagnostic assessment should be made after positive screening results [59] in order to confirm the diagnosis and to minimize the risk of attributing depression to RA in the presence of concomitant etiological disease (such as iatrogenic effects or other psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders associated with depression).

(p18.1) The correlation between rheumatological outcome and depression is strong, without consideration of the direction of causality, so mental health should be addressed as part of a regular procedure in rheumatological randomized controlled trials and cohorts. Assessing depression could be a significant psychomarker of rheumatological outcome. Depression should be assessed before and after starting treatment and also at different time-points during treatment, because there is compelling evidence that depression is highly treatable in patients with co-occurring physical diseases. Disease activity, as assessed by the DAS28 score, is used to make treatment decisions, and the fact that disease activity is influenced by depression scores means that depression scores influence treatment decisions. Correctly detecting and managing depression may be necessary for the effective management of RA [60].

(p18.2) There is a lack of interventional studies in this field. Extensive research should be undertaken in order to evaluate whether treating depression does lead to improved rheumatological outcomes. Further investigation into what type of therapy is the most effective in treating comorbid depression in RA is needed.

(p18.3) There is compelling evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness for depression in RA patients leads to better outcomes. Nursing interventions may be important adjunctive therapies to the medical management of RA patients. Secondly, most studies showed that depression in RA is drug resistant and does not seem to respond well to classical therapy. In line with the treat-to-target and the tight control strategy for disease activity, it has become clearer than ever that depression in RA patients must be addressed.

(p18.4) This review has several study limitations that can influence the conclusions, namely the fact that the literature is vast and highly unlikely to be completely summarized in one review, as well as the possible bias originating from the author's clinical experience.
