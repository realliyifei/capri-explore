## (s2) Biomedical Applications
(p2.0) Collagen is very abundant in nature in various forms and having several properties necessary for different applications in biomedical sciences.Indeed, it is a versatile biomaterial with wide medical applicability.Tissue regeneration or regenerative medicine is the set of techniques using engineering, cell culture, life sciences, and materials sciences to develop biological substitutes that can restore, maintain, or improve tissue functions.It is often based on the use of a scaffold that will serve as a support for the growth of new viable tissue.Various types of natural and synthetic biomaterials have been used to engineer oral mucosa, including collagen hydrogel from rat-tails and chitosan-fish scale collagen (Table 1).Using primary oral keratinocytes, Terada et al. [52] reported that a chitosan-collagen composite scaffold was constructed by blending commercial chitosan and tilapia scale collagen multilayered, polarized, and stratified epithelial layer with superficial keratinization.In another study, Tabatabaei et al. [53] investigated the viability of collagen hydrogel in the oral mucosa tissue engineering using human primary oral fibroblast and keratinocyte cells that isolated from gingival biopsies.The results showed the seeded keratinocytes' adherence onto the fibroblastpopulated collagen gel and development of a multilayered stratified epithelium on its surface after three days of cultivation, collagen hydrogels encapsulating fibroblasts increased cell viability.[52] Collagen hydrogel
