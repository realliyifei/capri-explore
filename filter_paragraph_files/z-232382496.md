## (s6) The Occurrence of Aflatoxins in Food in the Australian Continent
(p6.0) In Australia, hot and dry conditions typical for the arid and semi-arid areas covering much of the continent are the main stress factors that allow for the contamination of crops with AFs. This represents a major problem in Australia in terms of peanut degradation [114,115]. The occurrence of AFs is not quite as common in Australian maize [116], and when it occurs, it is in low or moderate concentrations [117] for unknown reasons [115]. Nevertheless, maize is only a small part of the human and animal diet in Australia [115].
