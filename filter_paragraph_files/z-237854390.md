## (s3) Nanomaterials for Energy Storage
(p3.0) A sustainable power provides requires a stepped-up alternate to renewable sources of power [12]. Energy storage performs necessary roles in conserving the over demand of strength for utilization all through the demand. On the other hand, many sorts of energy sources are intermittent in nature like photo voltaic power which is affected through cloudy and dusty weather, as nicely as the non availability in the course of the night [7]. Energy storage consists of a wide vary of applied sciences and functions and is categorized in accordance to the way in which the electricity is stored. 1) Chemical energy: accumulator, battery, redox flow battery, hydrogen, methane 2) Mechanical energy: flywheel, spring, pumped-storage power plant 3) Electrical energy: capacitor (electrical engineering), superconducting magnetic energy storage. 4) Thermal energy: warmness accumulator The storage of electrical energy is rather complex. It must first be transformed into every other shape of energy, which is associated with loss. Nanotechnology innovations are already contributing to expanded energy conversion, storage and transmission [12].

(p3.1) Nanotechnology may additionally have a profound have an impact on electrical storage technologies, i.e. batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors. Redox-based supercapacitors with nano-structured electrode materials have proven the possible to mix the excessive energy density of traditional batteries with the high electricity capabilities of electrostatic capacitors at the lab scale. Concerning rechargeable lithium batteries, the energy densities and the performances of these gadgets mostly rely on the bodily and chemical houses of the electrode material. In this regard, the decreased dimensions and high floor vicinity of NMs expand the charge of electron transport and the electrode-electrolyte contact, respectively, whilst the nano-structure itself affords facile pressure leisure and resistance to fracture. For anode applications, CNTs, a series of graphene-based nanostructures and silicon nanowires have been studied as promising host-high capacity materials and conductive additives [11].
## (s4) Battery, Accumulator, Capacitor
(p4.0) Batteries shop electrical electricity in the shape of chemical energy. All batteries work on the same principle: batteries are made up of two electrodes linked to a circuit. The "positive electrode" (cathode) is the electrode that takes up electrons when the battery is connected to a load. The "negative electrode" (anode) is the electrode that offers off electrons when in operation. A chemical response on the anode creates electrons whilst the chemical response on the cathode uses electrons. The reactions create an electrical current. A battery is recharged via reversing the electrical circuit in which an externally applied charge forces the electrons in the contrary direction. Batteries today are understood to be both essential as properly as rechargeable secondary cells. A secondary phone is additionally referred to as an accumulator. "Rechargeable battery" or "secondary battery" is extra regularly used in vicinity of accumulator. Due to the chemical reactions that take vicinity at some point of the charge-discharge cycles, structural modifications take place in the electrode materials of the battery, limiting the range of recharge cycles [12].

(p4.1) A capacitor, particularly the electrolytic capacitor, is an electrical component in which the electrolyte serves as the cathode and for this reason the second electrode. The capacitor stores electrical strength in an electrical discipline between the capacitor plates.

(p4.2) Capacitors can be charged and discharged extra than several million times except any sizeable trade in the materials. The various kind of energy storage will be more closely examined: 1) Lithium-ion battery 2) Lithium-air battery / Sodium-air battery 3) Lithium-sulphur battery / Sodium-sulphur battery 4) Printed battery 5) Supercapacitor 6) Nanocapacitor 7) Metal hydrid storage
## (s5) Nanotechnology in Industrial Sector
(p5.0) Nowadays, nanotechnology is offering new merchandise in all industrial sectors [2]. anotechnology is impacting the sphere of products, a number of merchandises that contain nanomaterials are already during a kind of items; many of that human beings do not even observe contain nanoparticles, merchandise with novel functions ranging from easy-to-clean to scratch-resistant. samples of that car bumpers are created a lighter, commodity may also be a ton of stain repellant, the ointment can also be a ton of radiation-resistant, artificial bones are stronger, telephone monitors are lighter weight, glass packaging for drinks land up at some stage in an extended shelf-life, and balls for a number of sports activities are created heaps of long lasting [3]. 
## (s6) Biomedical Applications
(p6.0) Nanoparticles are used for disorder diagnosis, drug delivery, gene remedy of cancer, pulmonary illnesses and prevention of different infections also. Cancer is malignant neoplasm, and there is uncontrolled division of cells which enter into everyday adjacent tissues and spoil them [2]. 
## (s7) Nanotechnology in Agricultural and Food
(p7.0) Production A range of nanomaterials, usually metal-based nanomaterials and carbon-based nanomaterials, have been exploited for their absorption, translocation, accumulation and consequences on growth and improvement of crop plants. The nice morphological consequences blanketed more desirable germination share and rate, length of root and shoot, their ratio and vegetative biomass of seedlings in many crop plants [5]. Nanotechnology is becoming popular in several fields like electronics, robotics, medicine, etc. However, it has been much less famous inside the food area as compared to different fields. Most vital applications in this zone are meals processing, meals packaging, food preservation, and food best monitoring [3].

(p7.1) Food Processing: Food processing is the formation of food merchandise from uncooked ingredient using suitable operations. Processing of meals includes a range of stepsremovals of toxic substances, protection from pathogens, protection of food, growing the shelf life, improving the colour, texture, odour of meals etc. Nowadays, all these strategies are made extra wonderful via the usage of nanotechnology.

(p7.2) Antimicrobial Packaging Barriers are made of nano-sized particles to inhibit microbial growth up to a certain level which may lead to food spoiling. Generally, nanoparticles in such kind of packaging are made of silver. Silver nanoparticles have the ability to inhibit and control the development of bacteria. Compounds like zinc oxide have antimicrobial nature which proves to be a vital factor in nanotechnology. Titanium dioxide can be used as a coating material in packing material to prevent the growth of bacteria.

(p7.3) Food Quality Monitoring Nanosensors are materials of nano-size used ordinarily for the detection of pathogens or contaminants in food. Nanosensors have very excessive sensitivity. The benefit of nanosensor machine is that hundreds of nanoparticles are frequently positioned on one sensor for correct detection of the presence of pathogens internal saved grain bulk in boxes and can also be arranged and disbursed into the gaps of grain bulk.

(p9.0) Nanotechnology is utilized in cloth industry due to the expanded sturdiness of fabrics, comfortness, hygienic homes and decreased manufacturing cost. The pleasant homes of nanoparticles can provide excessive durability for handled fabrics as they possess large floor region and excessive floor energy that make certain better affinity for fabrics and led to an make bigger in sturdiness of the favored fabric function. The use of nanotechnology approves textiles to end up multifunctional and produce fabrics with distinct functions, inclusive of antibacterial, UV protection, convenient clean, water and stain repellent and antiodor [3].

The varieties of international locations are competing with each other to fulfill the target of being developed international locations in the complete world. So, the increasing set-up of large-scale industries, factories and companies are going on in a continually unfavourable manner ignoring the environmental concerns. At present, the whole population is critically subjected to oil-based commodities in which coal, flamable gases and crude oil make a contribution about 41, 21 and 5%, respectively, and their consumption raises the stress of climate destabilization prompted by growing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) launch in the air. Carbon capture and storage is the latest and efficient innovation presently utilized to trap CO 2 and store it for beneficial purposes [13].
