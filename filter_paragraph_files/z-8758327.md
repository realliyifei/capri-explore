## (s10) Lens
(p10.0) The presence of serotonin and its receptors in the lens has not been extensively investigated, even is it has been ascertained that 5-HT is both synthesized in situ and transported from the aqueous humor. Serotonin inhibits the ATPase at the level of lens epithelium, and the physiological activity of this membrane enzyme represents a crucial point in the maintenance of lens transparence [24]. More recently, the administration of a selective 5-HT 3 antagonist to pregnant rats has been responsible for the development of nuclear cataract in the offspring. These findings seem to suggest that 5-HT 3 receptors play a significant role during the lens organogenesis, throughout a triggering effect on the cation channels [66,78]. Evidence for the presence of phosphoinositide cycle and its involvement in cellular signal transduction in the rabbit lens has been obtained by Vivekanandan and Lou [140]. These researches demonstrated that lens epithelium cells, like other cell types, possess a complete and functional phosphoinositide cycle, which is activated when the lens cells are exposed to serotonin or to other substances like calcium, epithelium growth factor and glucagon [140]. It is conceivable to suppose a role for the 5-HT 2 receptor class in the regulation of this mechanism. Lastly, Chidlow and coworkers has found very low levels in the lens of messenger ribonucleic acid for 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 7 receptors, indicating that these receptors are expressed in epithelium [28].
## (s14) EFFECT OF SSRIS ON THE INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE AND THEIR POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPTIC NEUROPATHY
(p14.0) The presence of 5-HT receptors in the iris-ciliary body complex (ICB), together with the presence of serotonin and its metabolites (5-hydroxyindolacetic acid and 5-hydroxytryptophol) in aqueous humor, give evidence for a role of this amine in the regulation of aqueous humor dynamics. Experimental studies have ascertained that 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A/2C and 5-HT 7 receptors are located at the level of ICB [10,28,85,98,136,137]. SSRIs increase the serotonin availability for these receptors, which react as though they were stimulated by agonists. Thus, the knowledge of each receptor function make possible to understand, with less difficulties, what happen when increased levels of endogenous serotonin reach the structures of anterior and posterior chambers of the eye (Fig. 3).
## (s15) CONCLUSION
(p15.0) In the clinical practice, the currently available SSRIs represent the most widely utilized medical therapy in patients affected by depression and/or other heterogeneous mood and anxiety disorders. A worldwide prospective analysis revealed that, during the next two decades, the incidence of these psychiatric diseases in the general population is destined to progressively grow [93]; thus, unavoidably, the agreeable effectiveness-tolerability-safety profile of the SSRIs will result in a more extensive prescription of these antidepressants by psychiatrists and also non-psychiatrists. Until the real involvement of SSRIs on IOP increase and optic nerve head changes shall not be well-ascertained, it is difficult to draw final conclusions on the more reasonable clinical management of depressed patient under SSRIs treatment. The knowledge of individual tolerability, angle-closure predisposition and critical IOP could be goals no so difficult to realize. In fact, although in the course of a search utilizing Medline, we have found only eleven papers documenting cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma related to SSRIs administration [4,12,18,39,46,69,71,79,80,86,145], the World Health Organization Adverse Drug Reactions database contains several other reports of undefined glaucoma associated with the different marketed SSRIs. This discrepancy further confirms the suspicious that the recording of pauci-or asymptomatic side effects, like POAG, is underestimated. Thus, because experimental and clinical findings indicate that SSRIs affect pupil diameter, aqueous humor dynamics and optic nerve blood flow, the following recommendations should be taken into account:

(p15.1) i. in presence of ascertained glaucomatous risk factors (sex, race, positive familial history for glaucoma, mid or high hyperopia, cataract, etc.) is ethic to submit the patient to an ophthalmologic consultation, before the starting of the SSRIs treatment;

(p15.2) ii. in elderly patients, before the starting and during the SSRIs treatment, serum electrolytes, and periodical IOP measurements should be prescribed; in presence of hemorheologic risk factors, specific examinations (i.e. computerized automated perimetry performed with different peculiar strategies and scanning laser Doppler flowmetry of the optic nerve head) should be, at least, advised.
