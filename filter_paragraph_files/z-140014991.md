## (s1) Design Material Selection and Requirement
(p1.0) By considering multiple characteristics of the composites can produce multiple performance of the materials and a proper procedure should be addressing to find the best output in automotive industry. Decision making on materials is extremely intuitive when considering single criterion problem. It can create a bias problem to other alternative materials. However, in the real world, the engineer should identify an appropriate criterion, goal, aspects, attributes and possible alternatives in MCDM. Most of MCDM used similar systematic evaluation steps which involving (1) determination the relevance criteria and feasible alternatives, (2) numerical measurement of the criteria and evaluation of the alternatives and (3) determining a ranking score of each alternatives [34].
