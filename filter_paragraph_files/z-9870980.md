(p3.0) Wen and Ding (Wen and Ding, 2005;Ding and Wen, 2005) studied theoretically the effect of particle migration on heat transfer characteristics in nanofluids flowing through mini-channels ( D 1 = mm).They studied the effect of shearinduced and viscosity-gradient-induced particle migration and the self-diffusion due to Brownian motion.Their results indicated a significant nonuniformity in particle concentration and thermal conductivity over the tube cross-section due to particle migration.Compared to the uniform distribution of thermal conductivity, the nonuniform distribution caused by particle migration induced a higher Nusselt number.
## (s6) Heat Transfer Coefficient
(p6.0) Since the heat transfer performance is a better indicator than the effective thermal conductivity for nanofluids used as coolants in transportation and other industries, the modeling of nanofluid heat transfer coefficients is gaining attention from researchers.However, it is still at an early stage, and the theoretical models for nanofluid heat transfer coefficients are quite limited.All the equations are modified from traditional equations such as the Dittus-Boelter equation (Dittus and Boelter, 1930) or the Gnielinski equation (Gnielinski, 1976) with empirical parameters added.Therefore, these equations are only valid for certain nanofluids over small parameter ranges.More experimental and theoretical studies are needed before general models can be developed and verified.

(p6.1) Recently, Polidori et al. (2007) investigated the natural convection heat transfer of Newtonian γ Al 2 O 3 /water nanofluids in a laminar external boundary-layer using the integral formalism approach.Based on a macroscopic modeling and under the assumption of constant thermophysical nanofluid properties, it is shown that natural convection heat transfer is not solely characterized by the nanofluid effective thermal conductivity and that the sensitivity to the viscosity model used seems undeniable and plays a key role in the heat transfer behavior.Mansour et al. (2007) investigated the effect of uncertainty in the physical properties of γ 2 3 /water nanofluid on its thermohydraulic performance for both laminar and turbulent fully developed forced convection in a tube with uniform heat flux.Since the effects of certain nanofluid characteristics such as average particle size and spatial distribution of nanoparticles on these properties are not presently known precisely, it is quite difficult to conclude as to the presumed advantages of nanofluids over conventional heat transfer fluids.More experimental data regarding these effects are needed in order to assess the true potential of nanofluids.
