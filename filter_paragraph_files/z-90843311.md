## (s2) Functional forms of autophagy and their implications for cancer therapy
(p2.0) Although, traditionally, autophagy has been seen as a pro-survival (cytoprotective) mechanism, different studies have shown that it may result in other outcomes. Currently, at least four distinct functional forms of autophagy have been described [24,25]: i) Cytoprotective, when cells die or arrest if autophagy is inhibited; ii) Cytotoxic, when autophagy induction results in cell death and its blockage results in cell survival; iii) Cytostatic, when autophagy induction results in cell growth arrest and iv) Nonprotective, if autophagy does not affect cell growth once blocked. These forms are distinguished on only based on their functional characteristics, having similar morphologic, biochemical or molecular profiles [24].
## (s3) Autophagy modulation as a therapeutic strategy to improve anticancer strategies
(p3.0) As already referred, the different functional forms of autophagy affect the cellular response to anticancer therapies. The knowledge whether autophagy is cytoprotetive or is cytotoxic/cytostatic, will help defining strategies for its modulation (through its decrease or increase, respectively) to interfere with the cellular sensitivity to therapy.

(p3.1) Targeting cytoprotective autophagy has been at the basis for multiple clinical trials. Indeed, if increased autophagy confers tumor resistance to death-inducing agents, its inhibition will allow an enhanced response to treatment [26]. There are several autophagy inhibitors already identified and that have been classified as: earlystage inhibitors, if blocking autophagosome formation [such as 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), wortmannin, and LY294002] orlate-stage inhibitors, acting at the level of the autophagosome-lysosome fusion and degradation steps [such as chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), bafilomycin A1, and monensin]. Studies using, not only these pharmacological autophagy inhibitors, but also genetic silencing or knockdown of autophagy-associated genes, resulted in increased tumor cell sensitivity to the autophagy-inducing stimulus, usually via the promotion of apoptosis [24,26].
## (s4) Autophagy in immunotherapy
(p4.0) The role of immune response has been gaining particular interest for cancer therapy. Recently, autophagy has also been described as playing an important role in the regulation of immune recognition and response [42]. It has been demonstrated that autophagy increases tumor cells immunogenicity, being involved in tumor antigen processing and in the subsequent activation of the effector T cells. Thus, strategies aiming at autophagy induction could serve as adjuvant to stimulate the antitumor immune response. For example, the use of tumor autophagosome-derived vaccines have been found to induce cytotoxic immune cells and, consequently, antitumor activity in mice bearing lung carcinoma and melanoma cell lines [43].

(p4.1) Recent studies show that, since increased levels of autophagy in cancer cell suppresses the antitumor immune response, autophagy inhibition improves antitumor immune response in immunotherapeutic strategies, such as adoptive transfer of T cells, vaccines, administration of antibodies or recombinant cytokines [44] Based on published findings, autophagy inhibition may increase the cytotoxicity of effector T and NK cells once they have been activated to lyse the tumor cells. The combination of high doses of IL-2 with chloroquine increased long term survival, decreased vascular leakage associated toxicity, and enhanced immune cell proliferation and infiltration in the liver and spleen [45]. Autophagy plays also a fundamental role in increasing the immunogenicity of the tumor cell, participates in the antigen processing and in the subsequent activation of the effector T cells, and its induction could be exploited as adjuvant strategy to stimulate the Hematol Med Oncol, 2017 doi: 10.15761/HMO.1000117 antitumor immune response [43,46] The understanding under which circumstances inducers or inhibitors of autophagy affect the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer treatments will be important to improve the rational use of such modulators, since the data available do not yet allow us to realize this [46].
