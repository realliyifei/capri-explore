## (s8) Heavy Metals and Ecosystem
(p8.0) Heavy metal contaminations of land resources continue to be the focus of numerous environmental studies and attract a great deal of attention worldwide.This is attributed to no--biodegradability and persistence of heavy metals in soils.In order to identify spatial relationship of heavy metals in soil-rice system at a regional scale, 96 pairs of rice and soil samples were collected from Wenling in Zhejiang province, China, which is one of the wel--known electronic and electric waste recycling centers.The results indicated some studied areas had potential contaminations by heavy metals, especially by Cd.The spatial distribution of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn illustrated that the highest concentrations were located in the northwest areas and the accumulation of these metals may be due to the industrialization, agricultural chemicals and other human activities.[21] Municipal solid waste (MSW) fly ash is classified as a hazardous material because it contains high amounts of heavy metals.For decontamination, MSW fly ash is first mixed with alkali or alkaline earth metal chlorides (e.g., calcium chloride) and water, and then the mixture is pelletized and treated in a rotary reactor at about 1000 C.More than 90% of Cd and Pb and about 60% of Cu and 80% of Zn could be removed in the experiments.[22] Among various water purification and recycling technologies, adsorption is a simple, inexpensive, and universal method.Spent grain is an abundantly available brewing industrial waste generated in the mashing process.Spent grain is a lignocellulosic biomass, which mainly consists of hemicellulose (30-35%), cellulose (23-25%), and lignin (7-8%).In principle, citric acid can directly interact with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in spent grain by esterification, which produced an effective adsorbent (ESG), suitable for adsorption of heavy metal ions which can be utilized as a new lo--cost adsorbent for heavy metal ions removal.[23] Phytoremediation crop disposal is a problem inhibiting the widespread use of the remediation technique.Flash pyrolysis as processing method for metal contaminated biomass, low pyrolysis temperature prevents metal compounds from volatilisation while valuable pyrolysis oil is produced.Biomass and pyrolysis products are analysed with the focus on the metal distribution; target elements include Zn, Cd, Pb and Cu.IC--AES measurements confirm very low levels of metals in pyrolysis oil produced at 623 K (Cu and Zn <5 ppm; Cd and Pb <1 ppm) with almost all of the metals accumulated in the char/ash residue.Pyrolysis mass and energy balances are determined providing information in view of future valorisation purposes Flash pyrolysis ca offer a valuable processing method for heavy metal contaminated biomass, thus limiting the waste disposal problem associated with phytoremediation.[24] Lead and Zn uptake and chemical changes in rhizosphere soils of four emergen--

(p8.1) Â°Heavy metals and living systems: An overview rooted wetland plants; Aneilema bracteatum, Cyperus alternifolius, Ludwigia hyssopifolia and Veronica serpyllifolia were investigated.The results showed that the wetland plants with different Radial Oxygen Loss (ROL) rates had significant effects on the mobility and chemical forms of Pb and Zn in rhizosphere under flooded conditions.For Pb, as a no--essential element, the wetland plants are able to decrease its mobility in both "clean" soil (with lower Pb) and polluted soil (and higher Pb); while for Zn, as an essential element, the plants are able to increase its mobility in "clean" soil (with lower Zn), but decrease its mobility in polluted soil (with higher Zn).Among the four plants, V. serpyllifolia, with the highest ROL, formed the highest degree of Fe plaque on the root surface, immobilized more Zn in Fe plaque, and has the highest effects on the changes of Zn form in rhizosphere under both "clean" and contaminated soil conditions.These results suggested that ROL of wetland plants could play an important role in Fe plaque formation and mobility and chemical changes of metals in rhizosphere soil under flood conditions.[25] The sewage sludge used in a study which had high content of organic C, available nutrients and heavy metals, its amendment led to higher concentrations of organic carbon, total N, available P and exchangeable Na , K , Ca and Mg in plants.This increases the beneficial utilization of sewage sludge for agriculture.[26] High contents of organic matter and nutrients make sewage sludge a perfect material for fertilization and recultivation of degraded soils.In the case of all sludges (in the proportion of 6%), a stimulating influence on seed germination was observed and inhibiting influence of sludges on germination and root growth observed in the case of cress (L.sativum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare).Toxic levels of heavy metals in the soil are responsible for the reduced chlorophyll content of the plants growing in polluted areas.After composting of sewage sludges, positively influences on the growth and development of L. sativum were noted.[27] The alternative aaerobic and aerobic composting of sewage sludge with organic garbage is a good way for improving the characteristics of sludge for the reuse and application in comparison with sewage sludge, the concentrations of heavy metals in the compost, such as Cu, Ni, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Zn, would decrease because of the dilution and fermentation.The results of the uptake of heavy metals by watercress show that the accumulation of Cu, Ni, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Zn in the crop is much lower than that required by the limited levels of Chinese criteria for vegetables.Watercress is a proper plant to be used in amended kailyard (KY) soil with compost of sewage sludge without any threat of bi--magnification of heavy metals.[28] Mangrove wetlands are important in the removal of nutrients, heavy metals, and organic pollutants from wastewater within estuarine systems due to the presence of oxidized and reduced conditions, periodic flooding by incoming and outgoing tides, and high clay and organic matter content.Study suggested that mangrove wetlands with Sonneratia apetala Buc--Ham species had great potential for the removal of nutrients and heavy metals in coastal areas.Wetland plants not only take up nutrients (e.g., N and P) and heavy metals, but also control the ventilation and microbial conditions in the wetland bed.The amount of total biomass for Sonneratia apetala Buc--Ham increased with wastewater nutrient concentrations, while the magnitude of heavy metal contents in the biomass was in the following order: Cu > Pb > Cd > Zn.Very good linear correlations existed between the biomass and the nutrients or heavy metals.In general, more than 98% of the heavy metals in the wastewater were removed by the soil and the rest of about 2% heavy metals were removed by the plant.This concluded that the Sonneratia apetala Buc--Ham species was more effective in the removal of nutrients than heavy metals.[29] Evidence in Support of Heavy Metals Heavy metals are toxic, but their oxides are usually not.Food and Drug Administration has approved arsenic trioxide to be used in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL).[30] There are some reports published on the harmful effects of ayurvedic Bhasmas of Indian system of medicine.Actually the Bhasmas can be toxic or harmful to humans only if they are not prepared in the correct manner.[31] The preparations are then prescribed with certain Anupanas (accompaniments), e.g., ginger or cumin water, tulsi extract, etc. that have been shown to protect against unwanted toxicity due to varied reasons, [32,33] including high proportions of trace elements and synergistic or protective effects due to buffering between various
