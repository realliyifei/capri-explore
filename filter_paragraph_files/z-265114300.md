## (s2) Classification of Edible Mushrooms
(p2.0) The classification of edible mushrooms is a critical starting point for understanding their potential cancer-fighting properties.Various types of mushrooms belong to different genera and families, each with its unique characteristics and bioactive compounds (Chang & Wasser, 2016).These classifications are essential to pinpoint mushrooms that exhibit potential anticancer effects.(Sliva, 2016) in inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing immune responses.These findings underscore the importance of evaluating individual mushroom species for their unique contributions to cancer therapy.
## (s3) Discussion of Active Compounds in These Mushrooms
(p3.0) Active compounds found in edible mushrooms are pivotal in elucidating their cancer-fighting mechanisms.Beta-glucans, polysaccharides, and lectins are among the bioactive components that have garnered attention for their potential role in cancer treatment (Wasser, 2017).These compounds exhibit various properties, such as immunomodulation and antioxidative effects, which are explored in later sections.Understanding the specific compounds within different mushroom species is essential for comprehending their mechanisms of action in cancer therapy.
## (s7) Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Properties
(p7.0) Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of mushroom compounds are additional facets of their potential in cancer treatment.Chang and Wasser (2016) emphasized the significance of mushrooms in mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are closely linked to cancer development.
## (s18) Discussion of Potential Side Effects or Contraindications
(p18.0) Exploring the safety profile of edible mushrooms is critical to ensure their responsible use in cancer therapy.A study by Wasser and Weis (2019) provides a comprehensive discussion of potential side effects and contraindications associated with mushroom consumption.They emphasize the importance https://jazindia.comAvailable online at: -1357 -of assessing individual tolerances and the need for caution, especially in cases of mushroom allergies or interactions with medications.
## (s19) Comparative Safety with Conventional Cancer Treatments
(p19.0) Comparing the safety profiles of edible mushrooms with conventional cancer treatments is a crucial aspect of this review.Research by Sliva (2016) discusses the safety of Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) in cancer treatment and highlights its potential as an adjunctive therapy with a favorable safety profile compared to some conventional treatments.Such comparative assessments help clinicians and patients make informed decisions regarding treatment options.
## (s22) Potential Synergies with Other Natural Remedies
(p22.0) Exploring potential synergies between edible mushrooms and other natural remedies can provide comprehensive cancer care options.Jayachandran et al. (2017) discusses the potential for synergistic effects between mushroom-derived compounds and probiotics.This suggests that incorporating probiotics into a diet rich in edible mushrooms may enhance their therapeutic impact through interactions with gut microbiota (Sudaldeep Sahoo, Tanuja Gayakward and Sanyogita Shahi, 2022).
