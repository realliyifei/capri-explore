## (s9) Patch Antennas
(p9.0) NASA's Glenn Research Center (GRC) has investigated numerous miniature antenna designs that could be employed for communicating on the surfaces of planets and moons.Among the designs explored, two have shown potential: the CMMA and the fHCFA.Both of these antennas were designed and tested in the research laboratory.While both of these antennas incorporate certain non-planar elements, such as the vertical metallic enclosure in the case of the CMAA antenna and the third-order Hilbert curve that folds in upon itself into four layers incorporated into the fHCFA antenna, their fundamental structure still relies on a patch and microstrip configuration.Therefore, these antennas have been classified within the planar category despite these non-planar components.GRC has developed and simulated the CMMA for lunar and space communication applications using IE3D simulation software (http://www.zeland.com/)(accessed on 4 October 2023).The CMMA exhibits a unique configuration characterized by a three-lobed patch enclosed by a vertical metallic barrier and a grounding boundary near the input location, as illustrated in Figure 4a,b.The selected substrate for the antenna is Duroid 5880, which has a thickness of 1.57 mm and a relative permittivity (ε r ) of 2.2.minimum operational frequency, rendering it well-suited for integration into small devices.The CMMA antenna operates at a frequency of 2.05 GHz and boasts the widest fractional bandwidth among the three reported patch antennas with a remarkable 6.3%.

(p9.1) Notably, this antenna delivers an impressive directivity of 6 dBi, surpassing the performance of the other two patch antennas in the study.This enhanced gain, coupled with its extensive bandwidth and directivity, positions the CMMA antenna as a promising candidate for various applications.In contrast to conventional small antennas, which are often omnidirectional, the CMMA's attributes make it suitable for deployment in a wide range of scenarios where tiny, high-performance antennas are typically utilized [44].NASA's GRC center has also developed the fHCFA using Zeland's IE3D electromagnetic simulator.This marks NASA's second antenna designed for lunar communication.The fHCFA boasts the smallest dimensions within its antenna group, consisting of four layers with measurements of 5 mm × 5 mm × 4.5 mm (length × width × height), resulting in a λ/30 design.The antenna structure was etched onto Duroid 5880 with εr = 2.2 at a thickness of 0.127 mm.It was affixed to an aluminum ground plane using multiple layers of adhesive, with 1 mm thick HTP-6 foam spacers (εr = 1.07) separating the layers.A probe feed was employed to excite the antenna, as depicted in Figure 5a,b.

(p9.2) These antennas were designed for operation across multiple frequencies, with particular interest in two different operating frequencies: 2.3 GHz and 16.8 GHz.These frequency bands, specifically the S band and Ku band, are well-suited to lunar surface network communications and planetary exploratory missions that rely on local area networks (S band) and satellites (Ku band) for establishing communication links.Remarkably, this antenna's multi-band capability eliminates the need for electrical or mechanical switching, allowing it to perform the tasks of two separate antennas while maintaining a reduced size.However, it is important to note that this antenna has the narrowest bandwidth within the group, measuring 0.5% at 2.3 GHz and 3% at 16 GHz.The directivity at the S band is measured as 1.6 dBi, while at the Ku band, it reaches 7.3 dBi [44,45].This antenna boasts an exceptionally compact form factor, measuring 12 mm × 12 mm with a height of 11 mm, making it one of the smallest antennas in the documented group.Its size corresponds to λ/12, where λ represents the wavelength in free space at its minimum operational frequency, rendering it well-suited for integration into small devices.The CMMA antenna operates at a frequency of 2.05 GHz and boasts the widest fractional bandwidth among the three reported patch antennas with a remarkable 6.3%.

(p10.0) The tapered slot antenna (TSA) is a microstrip antenna with a coplanar structu a tapered slot printed on a dielectric substrate.In support of the feeding apparat tapered slot's narrow extremity is affixed to the anterior portion of a receiver or the phase of a transmitter, while its wider extremity either captures or emits radio w the end-fire orientation.The slot antenna offers a broad frequency bandwidth, a sy rical radiation pattern, and end-fire radiation characteristics.The slot taper can tak ous geometrical forms, including linear taper (LT), exponential taper (ET or Vivald stant width taper (CWT), and others, each suited to specific applications.An array o may be arranged parallel to one another and utilized for airborne radar, beam-s multi-band capability eliminates the need for electrical or mechanical switching, allowing it to perform the tasks of two separate antennas while maintaining a reduced size.However, it is important to note that this antenna has the narrowest bandwidth within the group, measuring 0.5% at 2.3 GHz and 3% at 16 GHz.The directivity at the S band is measured as 1.6 dBi, while at the Ku band, it reaches 7.3 dBi [44,45].
## (s11) Slot Antennas
(p11.0) The tapered slot antenna (TSA) is a microstrip antenna with a coplanar structure and a tapered slot printed on a dielectric substrate.In support of the feeding apparatus, the tapered slot's narrow extremity is affixed to the anterior portion of a receiver or the output phase of a transmitter, while its wider extremity either captures or emits radio waves in the end-fire orientation.The slot antenna offers a broad frequency bandwidth, a symmetrical radiation pattern, and end-fire radiation characteristics.The slot taper can take various geometrical forms, including linear taper (LT), exponential taper (ET or Vivaldi), constant width taper (CWT), and others, each suited to specific applications.An array of TSAs may be arranged parallel to one another and utilized for airborne radar, beam-shaping antennas, imaging systems, and phased arrays [46][47][48].The Vivaldi antenna is a TSA that is recognized as the most advanced antenna for a variety of applications including wireless communications, biomedical engineering, and military applications [49].
## (s15) All-Metal Reflector Antennas
(p15.0) All-metal antennas are advantageous in space because they can tolerate low temperatures, intense radiation, and vacuum settings.Another significant advantage is the elimination of all dielectric materials in the antenna structure, which prevents electrostatic charge accumulation and related noise.Moreover, a short backfire design may be simply made and is lightweight, without the need for complex deployment procedures [60].In recognition of its high gain, high efficiency, minimal side lobes, great front-to-back ratio, small form, and sturdy construction, the short backfire antenna (SBFA), initially reported in 1965, has been widely employed in space, marine, and terrestrial applications.This antenna was used in, for example, the communication link between the NASA ground station and the Apollo spacecraft's two moon capsules.The fundamental low-profile design of the SBFA has experienced very modest alterations over the past 50 years, consisting of a cylindrical cavity housing a feed element situated between a ground plane and a smaller sub-reflector [61].
## (s16) Antennas for Low-Frequency Radio Astronomy
(p16.0) The lunar surface, particularly the far side, offers an attractive option for low-frequency radio astronomy, as elucidated in [66].Since low-frequency antennas on the lunar surface typically have minimal gain and directivity, achieving the necessary angular resolution for observing individual astronomical objects requires the use of interferometers composed of multiple small, low-gain antennas, such as dipoles.Notably, these antennas have a significant capacitive component in their impedance, making fixed impedance networks unsuitable for larger bandwidths.Therefore, for low frequencies, it is strongly recommended to use physically large antennas approaching half-wavelength in size, along with wide conductor shapes, to enhance the bandwidth.Two antennas were found in this category: lunar gravitational and polyamide film (thin film) antennas.These antennas have different deployment procedures compared to other antenna types.Both of these antennas were created for the purpose of research.
## (s17) Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antennas (LGWAs)
(p17.0) The Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA) project aims to create a lunar network to monitor gravitational wave-induced vibrations, paving the way for groundbreaking scientific exploration on the moon.By observing gravitational waves in the decihertz range, LGWA enhances our cosmic understanding and requires advanced components, including cryogenic sensors and noise-cancellation arrays, to minimize interference.Multiple stations with LGWA-grade arrays are crucial for effective noise reduction and local data analysis on the moon [27].
## (s18) Polyimide Film Antennas
(p18.0) Due to the aforementioned requirements concerning the electrical and mechanical properties of low-frequency antennas, the utilization of thin conductors becomes particularly crucial.This choice not only helps in minimizing mass but is also enabled by the relatively low electrical conductivity of the lunar regolith on the far side.As a result, it becomes feasible to position antenna elements directly on the lunar surface without incurring substantial adverse effects on RF performance.This approach opens up new possibilities for efficient antenna deployment in lunar environments.In [66], the authors discussed the challenges of low-frequency antennas: inefficient signal transfer for short antennas, limited gain at frequencies below tens of MHz without large size, and the need to address mechanical properties for larger antennas.For lunar surface antennas, non-selfsupporting thin conductors are suggested due to the low electrical conductivity of lunar regolith (10 −10 mho/m).
## (s22) Bow-Tie Antennas
(p22.0) The bow-tie antenna is constructed from a bi-triangular sheet of metal, with the feed located at its vertex.Bow-tie antennas fed by coaxial line, stripline, and coplanar waveguides offer several benefits as UWB antennas, including low profiles, excellent radiation efficiency, ultra-broad impedance bands, and ease of construction.Because of their benefits, they are widely employed in a range of applications, including ground penetrating radars, mobile stations, and pulse antennas [76,77].Detailed geometry and impedance calculations are in [78].

(p22.1) The previous iteration of the LPR utilized a CH2 transceiver antenna consisting of a series of bow-tie antennas.CH2 operates in the 250-750 MHz range and has a depth resolution of less than 30 cm.To achieve an ultra-wideband capability, this set of antennas was equipped with resistors that absorbed the current reflected by the set's end.Additionally, a shallow, rectangular conducting cavity was incorporated into the bow-tie antenna design to enhance radiation performance and prevent interference from the surrounding environment.The cavity was positioned behind the antennas to increase radiation directed toward the ground and improve the forward-to-backward ratio.The CH2 transceiver antenna was installed at the bottom of the lunar rover, approximately 30 cm above the lunar surface.Figure 15 provides a detailed construction schematic of the CH2 antenna.Each element has a size of 336 mm × 120 mm, with a spacing of approximately 160 mm between them.FEKO software and FDTD methods were used.A shallow, rectangular conducting cavity was used in the design to reduce interference from the surrounding environment.

## (s25) Discussion
(p25.0) In recent times, the moon has emerged as a focal point of technological research and development, particularly in the realms of in situ resource utilization, human exploration and habitation, and its potential role as a staging point for human missions to Mars [87].NASA's Artemis program is poised to establish a sustained presence on the lunar surface, ushering in an era of more extensive lunar exploration than ever before.This burgeoning lunar activity necessitates the development of advanced communication, navigation, and networking capabilities, and LUNANET stands as a prime example of meeting this demand.Notably, the United States, China, and India have already solidified their positions in lunar exploration, with several other nations, including the United Arab Emirates, declaring their intentions to embark on lunar missions in the near future.The moon, distinct from Earth, lacks an atmosphere, underscoring the importance of comprehending its surface and associated challenges.These missions serve as a source of national pride and demand substantial financial investments, emphasizing the significance of a thorough understanding of the lunar environment prior to their initiation.Moreover, lunar communication networks are not yet as established as their terrestrial counterparts.As noted in Section 2, researchers are actively engaged in the ongoing development of accurate propagation models.It is paramount to meticulously design and test the systems in such environments to ensure error-free operations, taking into account the limited optimization opportunities once the systems are deployed on the lunar surface.As elucidated in Section 3, lunar communication presents a multitude of challenges.Antennas, serving as pivotal components within the communication system, function as sensors for the entire network.Therefore, the stability of these antennas, both electrically and mechanically, is of the utmost importance.Conducting electromagnetic simulations is a fundamental step in this regard.As summarized in Section 4, lunar antennas possess many unique characteristics.Lightweight antennas with superior performance hold significant relevance in this context.Mission-specific antennas may necessitate additional coatings or special materials to withstand the extreme temperature conditions experienced on the lunar surface.The antennas discussed in the review article commonly serve dual roles, operating as both transmitters and receivers.This dual functionality is a prevalent feature in space communication systems, enabling bidirectional communication.It is vital to understand that the power capacity and data rate of antennas used in lunar missions vary significantly based on the specific mission's objectives and capabilities.Larger lunar rovers and assets, equipped with high-power and fast communication systems, may necessitate antennas capable of handling higher power levels and faster data rates.Conversely, smaller lunar assets and rovers, constrained by size and power limitations, may opt for lower-speed and lower-power antennas.The choice behavior in the lunar environment and developing models for the corresponding propagation channel in preparation for the upcoming Rashid rover mission.These findings will not only advance our understanding of lunar antenna systems but also play a vital role in optimizing the selection and placement of antennas for future missions, including the Emirates Lunar Mission (ELM).
