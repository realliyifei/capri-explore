## (s10) So . . . What Is the Plan?
(p10.0) A plan involves articulating and orienting towards a vision for the future-what some human geographers refer to as environmental imaginaries. These frame discourses for structuring the relationship of human processes within places, based on societal imperatives and aspirations amounting to the "virtualities" of future states of affairs [137]. This articulation, in the context of producing the "instrument" of a plan, might involve constructing a declarative set of goals, while orienting towards them identifies steps, stages, or strategies for their realization, though both should embody flexibility to changing circumstances, thus possibly entailing "menus" of scenarios that could be encountered [120,138]. This serves to "situate" the future within an as-yet unrealized (imaginary) SES, towards which the plan is intended to guide decision-making [139,140]. Strategic plans are generally flexible, longer-term, and less fine-grained than more near-term and discrete project plans, owing partially to greater uncertainty existing in "further off" futures [141].
## (s21) Problem: Emergence of Adaptation Situations
(p21.0) Insofar as SESs contain or capture the dynamics between human drives to utilize natural resources and systems, dilemmas stemming from these drives and the capacity of the environment to accommodate them emerge constantly [202,203]. This produces phenomena in which the social and ecologic system aspects relate (or are situated with respect) to one another, generally impelling tensions regarding resources and governance, thus engendering situations in which, according to Ostrom [169], actions may be taken to address or resolve them-generating the concept of the action situation [204][205][206].

(p21.1) The magnitude of climate change on earth's biogeophysical systems has compelled some authors to refine Ostrom's original notion to define adaptation situations as a particular form of action situation [118]. Citing previous work, Bisaro and Hinkel [207] describe the adaptation situation as one involving "one or more actors interacting within a common biophysical and institutional environment in which outcomes are altered through climate change". This implies that social features of the situation may be interested in adapting to climate change, as well as that, regardless of their interest or efforts, outcomes will be shaped by biophysical effects of climate change, which resonates with other scholarship describing the centrality of human endeavors to shape the adaptation situation [208][209][210].
