## (s6) The predictive and facilitating factors
(p6.0) The aspect that most affects development in individual factors is the experiences of emotional and physical violence experienced in childhood.Below are some studies we have selected.In an interesting research conducted in the Middle East, they administered tests that measured emotional maltreatment in childhood, affi liation among deviant peer groups, depression, violent behaviour, and suicidal ideations.It was found that emotional maltreatment suffered in childhood can elicit both deviant affi liation and depression, both of which can increase the likelihood of violent behaviour toward self or others [27].

(p6.1) to this line of thinking, the pressure of consequences would allow people to be able to reject the enactment of deviant behaviour.The fear of running into a negative consequence has the function of motivating the person to avoid such behaviours.

(p6.2) For example, the "punishment" of ostracism within Jehovah's Witness communities, involves the total marginalization of the person, by the religious community to which he or she belongs including family and relatives, this often discourages any kind of change of faith.Goode's contribution leads to seeing deviance not necessarily as synonymous with the transgression of the law with criminal actions but can express a different way of approaching things (outside the statistical norm).Following this thought, author Simon Dinitz identifi es 5 categories of deviance defi nable as 1) deviation from the norm of physical, physiological or intellectual functionality such as physical impairments or mental defi cits; 2) deviation from the religious or ideological norm such as heretics and dissidents;

(p6.3) 3) transgression of the legislative norm such as theft, drug dealing or murder; 4) deviation from the predominant defi nition of mental health in a society such as people who exhibit psychopathic or neurotic traits; and 5) deviation from dominant cultural values such as the Hippy movement or the Punk movement.In this sense, the defi nition of deviance cannot be considered only as the transgression of rules, but as the evolution of possible deviant behaviour from dominant cultural contexts.For example, the Hippy movement, which strongly criticized the customs of the time, brought a wave of new civil rights to sexuality and the fi gure of women (see right to abortion).In general, defi ning deviance requires having a cultural context of reference.Only then is it possible to know and understand what values drive that specifi c community and consequently understand what is being evaluated as deviant?
## (s18) Furthermore, people affected
(p18.0) by the histrionic disorder tend to seek the attention of others and demonstrate excessive and pervasive emotionality.Often, to seek such attention, an improper or provocative seduction is carried out.Through taking care of their appearance, seeking people's attention, and suffering if they don't get it.These people are easily infl uenced by others and trends.It is hypothesized that repeated maladaptive experiences in childhood in the relationship with parents are the most relevant element together with genetic factors.People affected by this disorder must present a pervasive tendency to seek attention and in their emotionality.Furthermore, they must present at least 5 of these symptoms:1) discomfort if they are not the centre of attention; 2) in interactions they are inappropriately provocative and sexually seductive; 3) emotional instability and superfi ciality; 4) using your body to attract attention; 5) the language is theatrical and impressionistic; 6) self-dramatization and theatricality; 7) suggestibility; 8) unmotivated intimacy in relationships[55,56].Those affected, however, by antisocial personality disorder feel aversion and contempt for rules and laws.This type of person tends to engage in deviant behaviors which sometimes result in criminal actions.They tend to justify their actions through the mechanism of rationalization, belittle the other, or be indifferent to the consequences of their actions and/or the negative effects experienced by the other.They also have diffi culty planning their life, showing inconstancy.They are often people who lack empathy towards others, which is why they hardly feel remorse.The weight of environmental causes is more evident in these subjects, especially in the developmental phase due to the family or social environment or the quality of the substances ingested or breathed.Genetic factors have a greater weight for adulthood.The main diagnostic criterion is contempt for the rights of others and at least 3 of the following characteristics: 1) repeatedly breaking the law; 2)
