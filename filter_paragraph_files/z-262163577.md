## (s14) From Research to Industry
(p14.0) Especially today, there is a close relationship between scientific research and the needs of industries. Sometimes, the needs of the industry cause the creation of projects for scientific investigation and find innovative ways and the feasibility of each of them. Sometimes, progress in science leads to finding solutions that were not even thought of before, while they help to improve the condition of factories. However, companies are more conservative in employing novel solutions due to a variety of factors, including significant investment costs, the need to modify an existing and successful system, etc. A crucial step in making MMs more prepared for serious entrance and widespread adoption in industries is the integration and implementation of MMs in laboratory settings or real production systems.

(p14.1) S. Bøgh et al. [3] suggested some elements as the infrastructure of integrating MMs into the manufacturing systems. They believe that finding a common language between academy and industry is a vital infrastructure. New concept development (NCD) is an approach used to achieve it. Regarding this model, based on the main strategical objectives, different opportunities can be identified and analyzed to help select the best out of various ideas that address each opportunity. Then, the concept and development of the required technology can be achieved. They suggested a technology push manufacturing technology (TPMT) model to help identify potential opportunities and their analysis. These methodologies can lead us to find the best applications for new technologies, such as MMs. After this application finding, it is suggested to define modules and skills for MMs because a modular system can provide more flexibility. To showcase the practical applications of our selected technologies in real-world settings, we recommend employing a breakdown approach, wherein smaller demonstrations are conducted instead of a S.

To showcase the practical applications of our selected technologies in real-world settings, we recommend employing a breakdown approach, wherein smaller demonstrations are conducted instead of a single comprehensive demonstration that may take an extended period. This approach allows for a more focused and targeted display of our technologies' capabilities, enabling our audience to better understand their potential benefits in specific contexts. A representation of how to achieve proper infrastructure for MM integration is shown in Figure 3.
## (s15) Industrial Applications
(p15.0) Similar to traditional industrial robots, MMs often find use in boring, stupid, filthy, and/or hazardous applications, with the added advantages of increased operational flexibility, expanded workspace, and enhanced overall equipment effectiveness. S. Bøgh et al. [3] investigated MMs as industrial assistance and classified their applications into logistics, assistive, and service applications (Table 1). single comprehensive demonstration that may take an extended period. This approach allows for a more focused and targeted display of our technologies' capabilities, enabling our audience to better understand their potential benefits in specific contexts. A representation of how to achieve proper infrastructure for MM integration is shown in Figure 3. 
## (s18) Increased Connectivity and Interoperability
(p18.0) One of the principals of Industry 4.0 is to connect system components in a decentralized architecture. Thanks to developments in IoT and M2M communication technologies, the connectivity of MMs in industrial environments has been enhanced. MMs can now conduct more complicated tasks and work together more effectively with other devices because of this improved connection.

(p18.1) Interoperability frameworks create a stable communication bridge among diverse IIoT devices, each with unique software and protocols. These span organizations, different vendors, and a wide range of cloud and fog/edge service providers with diverse architectures [44]. Viewed from an industrial point of view, interoperability provides a global standard that ensures a distinct data format, API, and communication protocol for data management, whether on local edge devices or cloud servers [45]. Therefore, the smart industry needs a universally accepted applicable standard that can effectively manage IIoT applications in industrial infrastructure. In the context of IoT, several standards and protocols have emerged to facilitate this connectivity and interoperability. A set of established protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), and CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) serve as the backbone for data communication. Notably, the OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) standard plays a pivotal role in fostering interoperability across various industrial control systems [46]. MMs may more easily be integrated into current production processes thanks to these protocols, which support interoperability between various equipment and systems.
## (s21) Flexible Navigation, Path Planning, Localization, and Mapping
(p21.0) The distinction between preprogramming and real-time programming of the common planning algorithms depends on whether the environment map is known or unknown. Many studies based on structured environments have been conducted in the past, which suggests that CMIM might accomplish localization and navigation by preprogramming. Industry 4.0's trend has evolved into a more adaptable mechanism, allowing the system to update the map concurrently and therefore improve efficiency. SLAM, or simultaneous localization and mapping, is a popular method for structuring the world at the same time. In tandem with SLAM's real-time mapping, vision-based line tracking, an element of the "Guided" driving approach, offers an intermediate degree of autonomy. This technique allows mobile robots to follow predetermined paths using visual cues, especially in environments with set structures [47]. Campbell et al. [48] detailed several robot localization methods, including GPS (satellite-based), odometry (wheel rotation measurement), inertial navigation systems (INS, without initial reference but prone to errors), and map-based location.
## (s22) Flexible Scheduling
(p22.0) The use of a decision-making framework for integrated task scheduling and resource mobility planning in hybrid production systems is discussed in [67]. The modular robot operating system (ROS) framework, an open-source platform that enables the interfacing of multiple robot kinds and robot brands, serves as the foundation for the proposed design, making it open. As a result, it is simple to include new sorts of resources in the decisionmaking process. The framework supports the scheduling of operations for the assembly of various components by interpreting various assembly sequences using a unified digital world modeling methodology. Using the mobile robot behavior as an assessment measure, such as execution time and travel distance, the system is able to optimize the task plans that are created. The implemented system also offers a number of improvements, including the ability to reconfigure the production system by moving mobile resource platforms to various workstations according to needs, the ability to generate the most practical and efficient robot motion plans, and the ability to enable online access to real-time shopfloor status using the identified obstacles as input. The suggested approach offers a viable response to the problems in hybrid production systems and is suited to small-to mediumsized production systems. Future research should, however, concentrate on improving and fine-tuning the suggested system in order to make it usable for a wider-scale application. The system should be integrated with a factory's legacy system in this approach. This will make the proposed decision-making framework more practical and relevant to a larger range of production systems by enabling seamless communication between the existing systems and it.

(p22.1) A novel scheduling issue involving a single MM performing feeding duties in a production cell was investigated in [13]. Mission planners must choose the best feeding sequence to reduce the overall traveling time of the MM while taking into consideration the unique characteristics of the robot and a variety of technological limitations in order to complete all tasks within the permitted limit of battery capacity. With the purpose of locating the best solution, a novel mix-integer linear programming model was created. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested methodology, a specific real-world example of an impeller production line composed of four feeders was detailed. The outcome was very appropriately used in actual feeding operations, and it showed that all feeders had no trouble feeding components to the production line. By taking into account a high number of feeders and/or a lengthy planning horizon, the complexity of the issue classified as being NP-hard rises. As a result, a meta-heuristic approach was used to resolve the large-scale mobile robot scheduling problem. Additionally, a rescheduling system based on collected schedules and input from the shop floor should be created to address real-time disruptions.
## (s26) Sensing and Perception
(p26.0) One of the first prerequisites of MMs to work in smart manufacturing systems is the ability to perceive its surroundings and accordingly make decisions. A wide variety of sensors and capturers were developed and are under development. The use of new technologies to improve the perception of MMs is addressed in much of the research.

(p26.1) The first stage for MMs to perceive their surroundings is to determine where they are in relation to their surrounding world. The difficulty in using the calibration technique on MMs is brought on by the variation in error between the mobile platform and stationary manipulators. The eye-in-hand calibration approach was used in the publication [72] using an MM to identify the actual coordinates of objects in the world's coordinates.

(p26.2) The advancement of hardware (GPUs) and deep learning techniques over the past ten years has greatly benefited the challenging discipline of computer vision known as object detection. With algorithms such as face detectors functioning in many common applications, object detection is increasingly becoming the state-of-the-art AI technique in our modern world. Broadly speaking, object detection is a technique used for locating an object of interest in a photo and determining if it is present. G. Andrianakos et al. [73] addressed employing object detection to monitor assembly-line personnel using machine learning methods. When an assembly task is finished, the system should signal that information. There are two techniques used to determine this. As pieces need to be placed together in order to be assembled, the first one is comparing the locations of the assembly parts (PD). Detecting which object is grasped by a human is the other method (HPD). As the phrase says, it may be difficult to detect for micro parts, while it may be effective for bigger parts. In order to ensure that the proper assembly work is being carried out and to avoid mistakes, the article suggested employing a two-level check technique utilizing the PD and HPD methodologies. The research also emphasized how critical it is to establish a threshold for grabbing likelihood in order to prevent false alarms and the potential advantages of adopting error detection techniques in the industry to speed up production, cut waste, and enhance product quality.

(p26.3) The BACCHUS project (MoBile Robotic PlAtforms for ACtive InspeCtion and Harvesting in AgricUltural AreaS) investigated the use of dual-arm MMs in agricultural areas for active inspection and selective harvesting. Within this project, for effective grasping, I. Sarantopoulos et al. [74,75] proposed approaches to detect the desired object in a cluttered environment and to make enough space around it for easier picking by pushing the surrounding objects. Instant segmentation was investigated by I. Kleitsiotis et al. [76].
## (s28) Virtualization
(p28.0) In order to combine and update the virtual environment with real-time data from several modules, including damper, barriers, and person detection, Ref. [103] implemented a DT infrastructure for a flexible assembly line. In order to evaluate HRI through gesture recognition, a scenario was put up in the GAZEBO physics simulation engine and included CAD files, virtual controllers, laser scanner data, simulated stereo camera data, and actual Kinect data.

(p28.1) In order to enable the dynamic behavior of HRC reconfigurable systems, Ref. [104] presented a DT-based system to complete the loop between the design and operation phases. To create the system's layout and work plans, the DT was combined with an AI decision-making logic. The physical assets and unified interfaces of the DT smart models are dynamically updated during runtime, creating a real-time planning scenario that is utilized when re-design is required. The suggested method aims to get past current restrictions on execution sequencing and the online reconfiguration of hybrid industrial systems. Their DT model provided the data required to optimize the system's structure by allocating duties to MMs and human operators at various workstations. A group of perception modules are deployed during execution to keep an eye on the execution, the surroundings, and people's behavior using a variety of sensors. These sensors record pictures in both 2D and 3D. These data are synthesized using the applicable DT data structures and are used to populate the real-time planning scenario as an activity map.

(p28.2) To benefit from the advantages of DT, it is necessary to address the issues with CPS and IoT as well as improvements in simulation environments with physics engines. To create more precise DTs, improved modeling of complicated jobs is also required. Better data flow between the DT's many modules is also crucial. Key enablers in this respect include further advancements in semiconductor processing and communication technology [93].

(p28.3) In line with Industry 4.0, a contemporary production approach known as "cloud manufacturing" (CMfg) turns traditional manufacturing resources into services by utilizing cloud computing, the IoT, and virtualization, and then it makes them accessible through the Internet. When necessary, the employment of the various manufacturing services may be cost-optimized thanks to an intelligent, cloud-based platform that controls them. The idea of CMfg encompasses every stage of a product's life cycle, from creation and design through manufacture and testing to maintenance while in use. Manufacturing as a service (MaaS) is the term for the cloud-based provision of production resources, such as hardware and software programs, as well as knowledge-based competences. The best services are chosen, capacities are established, and orders are planned and regulated using CAD data and databases of knowledge-based machines and materials. In this approach, a large number of clients may best access a wide range of providers (even those that are locally distributed), plan their own control and management layer (cloud layer), and manage production capacity, manufacturing processes, operations, and transactions.

(p28.4) The ability of MMs to interact and communicate has developed to the point that they could potentially be included in the overall production network. The aforementioned benefits enable MMs to operate efficiently and effectively in environments for advanced manufacturing, particularly CMfg, which naturally followed the introduction and success of cloud computing. In CMfg, manufacturing resources (MMs) and manufacturing capability (task flexibility and robotic mobility) are offered for requests in distinct sites within factories through centralized management. Moreover, these benefits of MMs help CMfg manufacturing lines, which are intended to be transitory in nature, produce small batches, while also allowing for longer production runs. As a result, the MM technology has enormous promise for the manufacturing sector as a whole and CMfg in particular [16].
