## (s4) Sentiments and Emotions
(p4.0) Sentiments and emotions are important and fundamental aspects of our lives.What we do and say reflects our emotions in some way.Emotion detection (ED) and sentiment analysis (SA) are two types of NLP techniques for analyzing human expressions that can help us to understand people's feelings towards specific topics [67].SA [68] aims to capture the overall emotional tone conveyed by a data source (usually positive, negative, or neutral), along with the strength of this tone [69].ED is the process of classifying data at a finer-grained level, according to the emotions that it conveys.

(p4.1) Compared to sentiment, the term emotion refers to more specific and stronger feelings [70].For example, positive sentiment encompasses a range of different emotions, such as happiness and joy, while negative sentiment includes the emotions of sadness and anger, among others.
## (s5) Relationships between emotions and misinformation
(p5.0) Although emotions are regarded as a dominant driver of human behavior, the exploration of their role in the online diffusion of misinformation has only recently begun.Misinformation can evoke emotional responses in readers, which in turn can lead to specific behaviors, such as belief in the information, resharing or liking it, etc [13].
## (s6) Emotion-based misinformation detection
(p6.0) Motivated by the results of analyses such as those outlined in Section 3, many studies have used sentiment and/or emotions as the main features to guide the automated detection of fake information.In this section, we provide a detailed survey of emotion-based methods for misinformation.We firstly introduce the datasets used to support the development of such methods, and subsequently describe a range of detection methods employing a mixture of conventional machine learning, DL methods, and advanced fusion techniques.We additionally provide a summary of the closely related task of emotion-based stance detection in misinformation.Table 3 lists the complete set of emotionbased misinformation detection methods that we have reviewed.Appendices B and C, respectively, list commonly used ED tools and provide an overview of evaluation metrics used in misinformation detection.The ease with which fake news is spread online is positively associated with the strength of anger that it conveys.[100] Anger and disgust increase users' engagement with fake posts.
## (s10) Advanced Fusion Methods
(p10.0) A wide variety of methodologies for emotion-based misinformation has been developed (See Table 3 for a complete list).In the majority of cases, information about emotions and/or sentiment is fused with other types of features, aiming to take full advantage of the specific characteristics of the dataset used to maximize detection performance.Additional features may be based, for example, on various aspects of textual content; information regarding the structure or temporality of collections of social media posts; and/or images associated with textual data.Moreover, approaches vary in terms of whether they carry out learning within the context of single or multi-task framework.In this section, we introduce a selection of these advanced fusion methods,

(p10.1) A Twiter_harvard [122] Twitter 111 events with tweet ids and user information (60 rumors and 51 non-rumors) A health-related news [123] Twitter 709 posts (54% rumour, 30% non-rumour and 16% unknown), collected using the keywords #zikavirus and zika microcephaly R MultiSourceFake [124] which are categorized according to the types of additional features and/or the learning strategy that they employ.
## (s14) Methods Based on Temporal Information
(p14.0) Various temporal features have been explored to enhance the performance of misinformation detection, based on the time-sensitive patterns that are frequently observed in social media, e.g., rumors initially spread quickly but gradually disappear, while reader emotions tend to change over time.The TDEI model [22] (Figure 9 (a)) integrates emotion features with information concerning time-sensitive dynamic changes in the topological propagation structure of tweets, which is considered to be a better predictor of rumors than the final, static propagation structure.The graph representing the propagation structure of a publisher post and its associated social comments is firstly divided into a sequence of temporal snapshot graphs.Stacked GCNs and a readout function are used to learn structural features of the snapshots.A GRU with self-attention is then applied to learn the diffusion process of structures.Meanwhile, emotion vectors are extracted from each post using a pre-trained, finetuned BERT model.A self-attention mechanism is then used to merge the emotion vectors for each post corresponding to a rumor event into a single vector, whose dimensionality is adjusted using a fully connected layer.The temporal dynamic structure and emotion vector are then concatenated and fed into multi-layer perception with softmax function to make predictions.
## (s18) Discussion
(p18.0) The analysis in Section 4 revealed the wide range of designs of advanced fusion methods for emotion-based misinformation detection.In this section, we conduct a comparative analysis to identify the most effective strategies.Table 5 provides performance statistics in terms of F1score for a range of the advanced methods discussed in Section 4, along with those of the baseline methods used for comparison.Where possible, we also provide the results of ablation experiments, i.e., where sentiment/emotion features are excluded to assess their impact on overall performance.As part of our analysis, we compare the performance of different methods that have been evaluated using the same dataset.Although we suggest possible reasons for different performance levels, it is important to note that performance may influenced by numerous factors, including differences in data processing methods, selection of base models, and the predictive behavior of the sentiment model, etc.

(p18.1) Feature Fusion: Textual data contains an abundance of information, which has been encoded using a wide variety of features in different misinformation detection methods, as illustrated in Figure 4.In Table 3, we list the specific features that have been combined with emotion and/or sentiment information in different studies.While a comparison of the performance of complete models with those of ablation experiments in Table 5 confirms the importance of sentiment and emotion features in misinformation detection, high levels of performance can only be achieved by combining multiple features.For example, it is shown in [124] that the proposed combination of topic and affective features outperforms the use of either topic or affective features in isolation.Furthermore, [131,132] show that extracting features from the images that accompany posts on social media platforms can provide additional clues about the emotional states and behaviors of individuals and thus help to boost the results of misinformation detection.

(p18.2) Model Fusion: Different models and learning techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages, and optimal misinformation detection performance methods can generally only be achieved by combining a number of different techniques.For example, pre-trained models like GloVe and BERT are effective in encoding textual content with word embeddings, while RoBERTa can be successfully employed for sentiment and emotion detection [213].Meanwhile, methods like CNN, LSTM, or GRU may be usefully adopted for feature extraction.Encoding information about the graph structure inherent in many datasets requires different approaches.For instance, dependency and sentiment trees may be used to represent grammatical or semantic aspects of sentence structure, while GCN and hypergraphs can encode the tree-like structure of social media data.To capture temporal features of rumor propagation, different studies have utilized RNN, LSTM and GRU models, which excel in handling time series data.The application of fusion or ensemble techniques can fully leverage the relative strengths of these different types of methods and models, as may be confirmed by comparing the results of the advanced methods with baseline methods in Table 5.
