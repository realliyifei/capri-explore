Fields: Medicine, Biology

## (s5) Cytoplasmic target
(p5.0) An apicomplexan including Plasmodium spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Cryptosporidium parvum, as well as opportunistic pathogens of immunocompromised individuals Eimeria spp.and Theileria spp., share distinct morphological features and cytoskeletal organization.Cytoskeletal system is multifaceted, comprising of interlinking filaments and tubules that spread throughout the cytoplasm.In Plasmodium, various metabolic pathways can be found in the cytoplasm, such as, folate metabolism and glycolysis.These metabolic pathways consist of hundreds of enzymes that may be potential drug targets (Gardner et al., 2002).A general overview adapted and modified from Gardner et al., 2002 on these pathways is shown in Figure 1.
## (s6) Enzymes involved in folate pathway
(p6.0) Empirical evidence also indicates that folate pathway is vital for synthesizing amino acids, as it is important for building of proteins for the malaria parasites survival.By referring to previous literatures regarding folate pathway, several drugs were developed to disrupt folate pathway with the aim of developing new treatment and prophylaxis for malaria.Folate pathway is also critical in providing cofactors for the metabolic events.The enzymes in this pathway serve as molecular targets, including dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS).DHFR aids in the oxidation of tetrahydrofolate (THF) molecule to DHF and its reconversion to the THF form (Hyde, 2005).DHPS is an enzyme with two binding pockets, one of which binds to dihydropterin pyrophosphate (DHPP), while the other binds with p-amino benzoic acid (pABA).DHPS catalyzes the reaction that produces 7,8dihydropteroate from these two substrates.Gardner et al., (2002).

(p6.1) Among the antimalarial drugs presently in use, the antifolates have emerged as the most promising owing to their well-defined molecular targetsdihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS)-that are also involved in the folate metabolic pathway.Antifolates are inhibitors of folate synthesis or folate conversions and are currently used for malaria treatment.These are first-line drugs in some of the African countries, as they are a costeffective choice for fighting chloroquine-resistant malaria (Hyde, 2005).The antifolates have also been developed as synergistic combinations of DHFR and DHPS inhibitors.Antifolates, such as sulfur-based drugs, which are analogs of sulfanilamide, can inhibit DHPS.These compounds compete with para-aminobenzoic acid in the DHPS active site.However, due to their inherent toxicity, there is paucity of studies on the sulfur-based drugs, which limits their use in antimalarial treatment (Nzila, 2006).Another evaluation of antimalarial screening of quinazolinones was carried out by Patel et al., (2017) both computationally as well as in vitro and its findings revealed their DHFR inhibitory potency.The main contribution of this study stems from identifying five out of nineteen potent antimalarial molecules (Patel et al., 2017).
## (s8) Approaches employed in the discovery of new antimalarial drugs 3.1 Computational approach
(p8.0) Drug design and discovery pipeline comprises all the drug development stages, from identifying a target to clinical trials for testing the drug on human subjects.Hence, drug discovery is typically considered a time-consuming and costly process.However, computer aided drug design (CADD), a computational technology aimed at assisting the antimalarial drug discovery process, has become indispensable in recent years.It makes use of the structural knowledge of either the target (structure-based) or known ligands with bioactivity (ligand-based) to facilitate the identification of likely candidate drugs (Macalino et al., 2015).

(p8.1) A study benefiting from this approach was performed by Granchi et al. (2015) with the aim of finding new human lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5) inhibitors.As a part of this investigation, an automated docking-based virtual screening platform was developed by considering different protein conformations and the consensus docking strategy.The authors discovered that two of the ten of the selected compounds efficiently inhibit the enzyme activity via enzymatic assays (Granchi et al., 2015).Given that it avoids carrying out enzymatic assays of thousands of compounds, CADD is highly cost-and time-efficient, as it helps optimizing the work in the laboratory.Several studies have been performed using both structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligandbased drug design (LBDD) approaches in finding new inhibitors for the enzymes in Plasmodium spp. as the target, as summarized in Table 3. Huthmacher et al. (2010) conducted their study with the goal of elucidating the capability of computational methods to foresee the metabolic activities during different stages of P. falciparum life cycle, which later led to the identification of new drug targets.Their findings suggested that the set of significant enzymes projected by flux balance approach signifies a reliable beginning for further drug development (Huthmacher et al., 2010).
## (s9) Natural products
(p9.0) It well-elucidated that countless compounds for drug discovery can be found in natural products.In the past two decades, their use has declined due to the technical difficulties associated with screening natural products in high-throughput assays compared to molecular targets (Harvey et al., 2015).Azas et al., (2002) evaluated potent in vitro synergistic antimalarial interactions between the extracts of Mitragyna enermis (Willd) O. Kuntze, Rubiaceae, Nauclea latifolia (Sm.)Guera senegalensis (GMel), Combretaceae and Feretia apodhantera (Del) by conducting isobologram analysis.The findings yielded revealed that tetrahydroharman isolated from G. senegalensis exhibits antimalarial activity with neither cytotoxicity nor genotoxicity found in Salmonella Ames test, with and without metabolic activation (Azas et al., 2002).
## (s10) M18 aspartyl aminopeptidase
(p10.0) Derivative of quinine, chloroquine, 8aminoquinoline and known antimalarial M18AAP inhibitors (AID743024) (Kumari et al., 2016) More recently, Upadhyay et al. (2014) reported antimalarial potential of extracts and compounds from the chloroform and n-butanol fractions of Ammannia baccifera roots and methanol extract of Ammannia coccinea (AC).These extracts are commonly used in Chinese and Indian medicine as a therapy for diseases.The compounds were isolated from the extracted and fractionated dried and powdered samples, followed by repeated chromatographic separations of the fractions.The compounds effectiveness was demonstrated in vitro through antiplasmodial activity against P. falciparum NF-5.Extracts from AC showed potency in antiplasmodial activity and nontoxic to Vero cells.The authors thus concluded that the selective antiplasmodial activity from these plants will be advantageous in antimalarial drug development and discovery of safer therapeutics (Upadhyay et al., 2014).

(p10.1) Thiengsusuk & Chaijaroenkul (2013) performed an evaluation of antimalarial activities of Thai traditional medicine which consist of 27 medicinal plants and 5 herbal formulations used against chloroquine-resistant (K1) and chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) P. falciparum clones.Their results indicate that that ethanolic extracts from 19 investigated plants/herbal formulations exhibited promising activity against both K1 and 3D7 clones of P. falciparum, with < 50% survival at the concentration of 50 μg/ml.In addition, eight medicinal plants and two herbal formulations that were included in this investigation showed potent antimalarial activity with median range IC50 values < 10 μg/ml against K1 or 3D7 P. falciparum clone or both (Thiengsusuk & Chaijaroenkul 2013).Sethiya et al. (2014) screened methanol extract of Evolvulus alsinoides for P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase enzyme inhibitory activity, reporting that E. alsinoides possesses a compound known as scopoletin that potentially inhibits the PfLDH.E. alsinoides is generally recognized as Shankhpushpi and is used in traditional remedy for malarial treatment by some ethnic populations of India (Sethiya et al., 2014).
