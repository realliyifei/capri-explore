## (s6) Results
(p6.0) The first publications found in the SCOPUS presenting the idea of using LCSs dealing with indoor monitoring of buildings and structural ones are both dated in 1993 (these two articles were not considered in the statistical analysis of this research as they were introducing the idea of utilizing low-cost sensors (e.g., fiber optic sensors) in building monitoring). Measures evaluated the types of low-cost strain optic sensors and he approved the applicability of Bragg grating which had satisfied the requirements for smart structures, due to the developed ratiometric wavelength demolition system [100]. Tsilingris presented a low-cost flat-response, temperature compensated sensor designed for measuring of the radiation transmission, that can be used for underwater uses and solar ponds [101]. Figure 3 illustrates the significant of LCSs in the articles found in SCOPUS database from 2006 to 2020. It can be observed in the figure that since 2006 until 2013 the quantity of the publications associated with the use of LCS for structural monitoring are negligible (27%) and more than 73% of the articles have been published in the last 7 years (from 2014 to 2020). This rebound in terms of projects dealing with indoor monitoring of buildings occurred at the same time as the number of publications has the share of 77.4% in the last 7 years and only 22.6% of them were conducted in the first 8 years.

## (s15) Structural Building Monitoring
(p15.0) In this section, low-cost approaches for monitoring structural parameters of buildings are overviewed. Structural monitoring of the buildings using LCSs is the second group of work analyzed. Controlling the aging process of buildings by monitoring acceleration, as well as strain or displacement is crucial for structural safety. Therefore, in this section the existing low-cost technologies for the measurements of the acceleration and displacement or strain are reviewed. Figure 8 illustrates the increment of publications over the years associated with low-cost structural building monitoring. In fact, in the two main subcategories of structural health monitoring, detecting structural response through determination of vibration pattern in buildings is more decisive as it contains 56.8% of reviewed articles published until 2020. The articles of this part were limited to the publications from 2006 onward as this is coincident with development of Arduino at the end of 2005. The first article founded in 2006 aimed to reduce the labor and cost associated with building monitoring [159]. They used low-cost analog sensors and ATmega 128 microcontroller for real time structural monitoring of a half-scale building installed on a shaking table. It can be seen that the quantity of the annually publications related to the low-cost accelerometer are so limited from 2006 until 2013 as they have the share of 28.5% in the whole reviewed articles. However, the number of papers published in the last 7 years has increased by 150% and has the share of 71.5%. Such an increment is in line with the developments of the low-cost data acquisition systems using microcontrollers and low-cost kits. group of work analyzed.

It can be observed that Italy and USA had the most contributed to the low-cost structural building monitoring by reporting 12 and 8 publications, respectively. Then, 3 publications were carried out in China and Taiwan each. Additionally, 2 articles were executed in Japan, and the quantity of the publication for the other 10 countries in the map (Serbia, Portugal, Spain, Indonesia, India, Australia, Greece, Korea, Poland, and Germany) were 1 each.

(p18.0) The rest 43.2% of publications remains from the structural health monitoring, discussed implementation of low-cost sensors for monitoring of structural deformation, damage detection and the measurements of strain and displacement at various parts of the buildings. The first publication associated with this area dated in 2007. In this publication Tosi et al. focused their studies on a cheap interrogation system of fiber Bragg gratin sensors for crack monitoring and measuring the strain up to 320 µε with precision of 3% [177].
