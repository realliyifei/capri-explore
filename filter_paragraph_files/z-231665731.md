## (s4) Methods
(p4.0) Our approach was based on a two-staged iterative review and synthesis process. The paper is organized as follows. Initially, we compare traditional and eCohort studies across the 6 core steps in their life cycle as outlined in Figure 1. We then continue discussing eCohorts in the context of additional characteristics such as flexibility, interactivity, usability, security, scalability, and costs. Our synthesis relied on a (1) narrative literature synthesis and (2) our own experiences with traditional cohorts and eCohorts, such as with the Women's Interagency HIV Study [15], Swiss HIV Cohort Study [16], and Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Registry [17]. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar (first 5 pages) using the terms "cohort profile," "cohort description," "cohort methods," as well as "e-cohort," "web-based cohort," "online cohort," and "digital cohort." For traditional cohorts, to avoid an unmanageable number of hits, we set the filter to observational studies in PubMed, which automatically captures only publications from 2012 onward. To include older cohorts, we used Google Scholar. This was followed by the selection of 10 traditional cohort and 10 eCohort studies. As we did not aim to provide a detailed synthesis of all existing literature, we arbitrarily set the cutoff at 10, based on narrowing down iteratively and pragmatically. Our selection was guided by the criteria outlined in Textbox 1. First, we selected studies with titles and abstracts that clearly indicated a detailed methodological account. We then proceeded iteratively to select 10 traditional and 10 eCohort studies that together provided the most rich and broad methodological information, with as few as possible overlaps, while also fulfilling the third criterion of Textbox 1.

## (s13) Stage 6: Dissemination
(p13.0) Details on the dissemination of cohort findings were scarce in the included traditional cohort publications. Dissemination seems to be focused on scientific publications, which, if added to the lengthy data collection and analysis completion periods, seems to have a rather delayed character. Nonetheless, traditional cohorts may have dedicated websites through which publications and key findings can be retrieved. A further element that could be described as integral to the dissemination strategy of traditional cohorts is the use of findings for the development and dissemination of clinical tools such as risk prediction scores [18,23,25].

(p13.1) By contrast, the dissemination of findings received greater emphasis in the included eCohort publications. The internet (eg, websites, newsletters, and social media) seems to be the primary tool for communicating updates and findings [7,9,27,30]. As mentioned in the previous section, the flexibility of digitalization may allow for faster data access and therefore more possibilities for preliminary analyses. In turn, this enables more frequent communication of findings and less lengthy gaps between updates [7,27]. Communication of updates, relevant news, and findings, including community outreach (eg, by webinars) and presentations to health care staff, participants, and patients, may be a part of overall strategies for maintaining participant motivation and mitigating attrition [7,30]. An important opportunity arising from eCohort (and digital health) research is that of reproducibility. Although science is undoubtedly facing a reproducibility crisis, the internet and its inherent possibilities for data availability and accessibility may eliminate replication barriers [32]. As data and technology availability increases, the practical challenges and costs of replicating research (eg, rerunning analyses) diminish. This is further facilitated by initiatives such as open science registries that aim for transparency and wide access to public research data [32]. If done correctly, the findings of eCohorts can facilitate reproducibility and open science, turning a crisis into a strength.

(p13.2) An overall summary comparing traditional cohorts to eCohorts is shown in Table 2. Primarily offline advertisement (eg, flyers, posters, newspaper advertisements), but increasingly complemented by online approaches Recruitment usually within clinical (eg, by health care providers) or community setting and appointment-based Consent procedures usually face to face and paper-based Primarily online advertisement (eg, webpages, newsletters, forums, social media), but can be complemented by offline approaches (eg, flyers, posters) Recruitment usually online, through dedicated study webpages, possible at any place, any time Electronic consent procedures Recruitment Primarily offline (eg, paper-based questionnaires, data retrieval from existing records, personal interviews), and may be combined with medical examinations and biosampling Primarily online and usually directly reported by participants (eg, web-based surveys). Sometimes complemented by offline data collection (eg, mailed surveys) and nonself-reported data (eg, medical record data) Baseline data collection Primarily offline (eg, paper-based questionnaires, data retrieval from existing records, personal interviews, medical examinations, and biosampling, mailed reminders)

(p13.3) Usually linked to medical care; personal relationship (or at least personal interactions) between participant and study coordinators Strong focus on data quality, reliability, and internal validity Primarily online and usually directly reported by participants (eg, web-based surveys, personalized email, or SMS text message reminders) Rarely linked to medical care. Use of internet (eg, study website, social media, newsletters) for outreach and participant contact/engagement Data quality, reliability, and internal validity may be a concern Data quality tradeoffs due to self-reporting; need for simpler questions, better data management, and user-friendliness 
## (s17) Ethics and Security
(p17.0) Security plays an equally important role in motivating and sustaining participation. Ethical and privacy issues are inherent to the internet, which comes with certain vulnerabilities and risks related to various stages of a cohort design, including recruitment, advertising, and data collection [7,9]. Targeted advertising (eg, through social media platforms) requires the use of data that might be considered as private (eg, demographics, education) before a person is even aware of a study's existence and long before they consent to participate [33,34]. Along similar lines, showing interest in an online advertised study (eg, by clicking on an advertisement) leaves an online trail that can be easily used by advertising companies for further profiling and targeted commercial advertising [33,34]. The tracking of our online behavior is inherent to the internet; nonetheless, this is challenging from an ethical and privacy perspective, especially in the context of sensitive health research. Further issues may arise from a certain loss of control over advertising, especially if that involves the sharing of advertisements by third parties and through various social media networks. Such uncontrolled spread might lead to losing sight of where a cohort is promoted, as well as of potential comments or questions that might have been posted across the internet [35]. Obtaining informed consent is an essential aspect of recruiting participants in a cohort. When conducted in a face-to-face manner, questions and concerns can be addressed interactively, which is lost if informed consent is obtained online and without individual contact. Filling this gap requires carefully designed online consent procedures that are transparent, understandable, and contain all elements of regular informed consent [36]. Finally, the internet makes it easier for sensitive data to be accessed without authorization, as well as hacked or replicated [33]. Although individual risk can be kept low if data are anonymized, some argue that the ease in which digital information is linked, shared, and merged renders all data potentially identifiable or traceable [37]. Therefore, adequate security features that keep risk at a minimum are inevitable [7]. Some of these features include robust password protections, high-standard information technology security, encrypted communication and data transfer, strict access controls, data deidentification, as well as the separation of personal information and unidentifiable data [7]. The emphasis on security also increases the responsibility that participants themselves have to carry, including adequate password protection, correct communication with study sites, and ensuring that devices and software are up to date.
