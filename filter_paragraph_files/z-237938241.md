## (s0) Structure and Chemical Composition of the Eggshell and Eggshell Membrane
(p0.0) The avian eggshell, representing about 10% of the egg weight, is composed of the shell and shell membrane. The shell is a calcareous structure predominantly constituted of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) (95%) and an organic matrix composed of proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans (3.5%) [1,2]. The eggshell membrane (ESM) consists of cross-linked collagens (I, V, and X), glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), egg white proteins (i.e., Ovotransferrin, Lysozyme) and eggshell matrix proteins (i.e., Ovocalyxin-36) [1][2][3][4][5]. The ESM is the innermost component of the eggshell, lying in between the mammillary layer and the egg white. It features a unique fibrous net structure, allowing the mineralization process of the eggshell from the outer surface of the ESM, as well as keeping the egg white from mineralization [6,7]. During the early stage of incubation, the ESM is firmly combined to the mammillary cones, and it is difficult to separate through mechanical action. However, this connection weakens as incubation progresses [8]. The ESM is divided into three layers: the outer shell membrane, the inner shell membrane, and the limiting membrane. The detailed structure of the egg shell and ESM is indicated in Figure 1, showing the triple-layer structure with a spiral arrangement of these layers [9].

(p0.1) The outer shell membrane represents the outmost layer of the ESM and facilitates the close attachment to the eggshell. Fibers in the outer shell membrane present bud-like structures on top of the mammillary knob, allowing a strong binding between the ESM and the eggshell [8]. The outer shell layer is also the thickest of the three layers, with a thickness of approximately 50-70 µm [1,10]. The fibers in the inner shell layer intertwine with fibers in the outer shell membrane, except in the air cell region [11]. The limiting layer is a slender structure that directly covers the egg white [7]. Due to the presence of a great number of fiber knobs, the outer shell membrane is rougher than the inner shell membrane [12]. In addition, the fibers in the three layers of the ESM vary in diameter, decreasing from the outermost to the limiting membrane [13].

In addition, the fibers in the three layers of the ESM vary in diameter, decreasing from the outermost to the limiting membrane [13].

(p0.2) The ESM is rich in protein-based fibers, comprising of about 80-85% proteins [14]. It was reported that the ESM contains over 500 different types of proteins [15]. Collagens are the major structural basis of the fibers, making up 10% of the ESM [16]. The ratio of collagen I and V is about 100:1, with their contents in the outer and inner layers of the ESM significantly different [17]. While the inner ESM contains both collagen I and collagen V, the outer ESM presents only collagen I [18]. Another type of collagen, collagen X, is found in both the outer and inner layers of the ESM. Collagen X is believed to inhibit the mineralization process, preventing both the egg white and yolk from mineralization [7,19]. However, such a hypothesis is in contradiction with the fact that collagen X is located in the core of the fibers [6]. Fibronectin, a dimeric form glycoprotein with the function of activating or binding proteins, is another type of protein present in the ESM [20]. Osteopontin, which contains numerous binding sites for cell and calcium as well as various serine/threonine phosphorylation sites is also present in the ESM [21]. In addition to these various proteins, CaCO3 minerals are also present in the ESM, along with sialic acid, uronic acid, and small amounts of saccharides [3,22]. The main chemical components of the eggshell membrane and their functions are summarized in Table 1. The ESM is rich in protein-based fibers, comprising of about 80-85% proteins [14].

## (s3) ESM for Joint Health
(p3.0) Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disease, affecting significantly the patients' ability to function and quality of life. Very often, patients rely on dietary supplements for pain relief. The eggshell membrane has been tested as a natural therapeutic for joint and connective tissue disorders and was reported to exert some beneficial effects on joint pain, stiffness, and cartilage turnover induced by overexercise [69]. In a randomized study, postmenopausal women were assigned to a placebo and intervention group, with thirty women taking orally a commercial product, Natural Eggshell Membrane (NEM ® ), 500 mg once per day for 2 weeks while conducting regular exercise on alternate days. The results showed that the cartilage turnover was significantly reduced in the intervention group. The consumption of the eggshell membrane product rapidly improved the recovery from exercise-induced joint pain and stiffness as well as reduced the discomfort immediately after exercise [69].
## (s4) ESM for Wound Healing
(p4.0) ESM has been used as a biomaterial to promote the healing of skin wounds. Solubilized ESM may facilitate the synthesis of type III collagen in the skin of hairless mice as well as significantly improved the elasticity of human skin and reduced facial wrinkles [74].

(p4.1) Non-healing skin wounds are regarded as a major health problem globally, causing high morbidity and mortality. Processed eggshell membrane powder (PEP) offers great potential as a cost-effective wound-healing product. Using the mouse excisional woundsplinting model, researchers showed that PEP facilitated wound closure faster in the treated group than in the untreated groups [23,75]. Furthermore, sPEP stimulated matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) activities in both dermal fibroblasts and mouse skin during a 10-day incubation period. PEP also enhanced the MMP-2 protein levels and promoted the production of alpha-smooth muscle actin [76].

(p4.2) ESM patching may also offer a potential treatment for tympanic membrane (TM) perforation [77]. Researchers randomized traumatic TM perforation patients into two groups: the perforation edge approximation group and the eggshell membrane (ESM) patch group. The results showed that ESM patching significantly shortened the healing time, particularly in patients who were suffering from moderate to severe traumatic TM perforations [78].

(p4.3) Physicochemical properties of the ESM such as hydrophilicity and hardness can be modified using inorganic compounds. For instance, depositing copper (Cu)-containing bioactive glass nano-coatings (Cu-BG) on the ESM produced Cu-BG/ESM films that were able to significantly enhance angiogenesis in vivo, allowing the construction of constant and uniform epidermis layer, leading to higher healing quality. In addition, a substantial amount of Cu 2+ ions released from these Cu-BG/ESM films significantly reduced bactericides and therefore prevented wound infection [79]. Researchers found that combining EMS with silver nanoparticles improved re-epithelialization, granulation tissue construction, and wound healing by facilitating cell proliferation and inhibiting inflammation [80].
## (s6) ESM for Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Activity
(p6.0) The anti-inflammatory effects of ESM have been also investigated in several studies. After being processed by cryo-grinding and homogenization into particles approaching submicron dimensions, ESM powder exerted some anti-inflammatory activity, while its antimicrobial activity against skin-associated pathogens was also enhanced [84]. The aqueous extract of ESM can also affect signaling events during responses to the T cell-specific mitogen phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen. This influence may be mediated through a decrease in the level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, providing some insights into the use of ESM as an anti-inflammatory product [85]. Vuong et al. also confirmed that both processed ESM power and EMS-derived soluble fractions demonstrated antiinflammation and immunomodulation properties in lipopolysaccharide-triggered human monocytes and macrophage-like cells through the intervention of NF-κB [86]. Yoo et al. treated ESM with acetic acid and divided hydrolysate into fractions of different molecular weights. They found that the whole ESM hydrolysate and the fractions with more than 10 kDa presented some anti-lipopolysaccharide and anti-IFN-γ-induced inflammation activities as well as an outstanding effect on suppressing skin inflammation [87]. Ovocalyxin-36 is a protein from ESM with immuno-modulating effects. In vivo, peptides derived from ovocalyxin-36 are more effective at reducing LPS-induced inflammatory symptoms and inhibiting the local production of pro-inflammatory mediators in the small intestine [42]. Hence, ESM hydrolysates offer some promising leads as an oral anti-inflammatory product.
## (s8) ESM for Biomineralization
(p8.0) Biomineralization is a process in which specialized cells secrete and deliver inorganic ions into confined spaces within organic matrices or scaffolds. Calcitic biomineralization is essential in humans for the formation of otoconia, which is required to perceive linear acceleration and the effects of gravity. ESM can be applied as a biomineralization substitution of CaCO 3 nano-crystals [95], with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins from the ESM influencing the process of biomineralization. There are 46 proteins associated with the membrane fibers, and most of them are candidates for regulating calcitic biomineralization [26]. As a major component of the non-mineralized ESM, type X collagen has a controversial role in the biomineralization process. Some scientists reported that type X collagen suppresses cellular mineralization and limits the deposition of minerals [19], while others considered that it facilitates the regulation of calcification [96].

(p8.1) Recently, more studies focused on modifying ESM to serve as a biotemplate for crystal growth or as a biomineralization model. For example, ESM was a suitable biotemplate allowing hydroxyapatite crystals to form flower-like agglomerates [97]. ESM can also influence the type of CaCO 3 polymorph during the initial stages of the repair process of the shell of the land snail Helix aspersa after an injury [98]. After treatment with sodium trimetaphosphate, phosphate groups were introduced onto the surface of type I collagen and strengthen the mineralization of ESM by forming calcium phosphate crystals [99]. In addition, it was shown that polycarboxylated ESM contained more surface nucleation sites for CaCO 3 mineralization [100].
## (s11) ESM for Food Packaging
(p11.0) The edible films are safe and eco-friendly packaging materials to protect foods against oxygen, carbon dioxide, lipids, aroma, flavors, and moisture [108]. ESM as a food byproduct contains abundant proteins, which has huge potential to be used in food packaging. The ESM-derived gelatin has been applied to produce edible films with chitosan. The addition of ESM in edible films showed that it could be an excellent material to improve the mechanical and barrier properties of films [109]. The SEP has been proved to interact with soybean protein isolate due to the hydrogen bonds. The protein-based composite film containing SEP, soy protein isolate, and eugenol showed the satisfying mechanical, barrier, water resistance, and hydrophobic features [110].
## (s12) ESM for Biosorbent Activities
(p12.0) Due to its potential for chemical modifications, ESM is also an excellent biosorbent and is used to absorb various inorganic substances [111,112], dye [113][114][115][116][117], and other substances in aqueous solution.
## (s13) Safety Evaluation of Eggshell Membrane
(p13.0) ESM as a novel dietary ingredient has been evaluated for safety in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. ESM-derived products have shown no cytotoxic effects at a dose of 100 µg in human cell viability assay after incubation for up to 20 h. ESM shows no genotoxic effects in a mutagenicity evaluation using histidine-dependent Salmonella typhimurium and tryptophan-dependent Escherichia coli at a dose of up to 5000 µg/plate. In animal studies, ESM did not exhibit any signs of acute toxicity after a single oral dose of up to 2000 mg/kg body weight. After the administration of repeated oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg body weight per day for 90 days, ESM did not cause any sign of toxicity as evaluated by urinalysis, hematology, clinical chemistry, or histopathological examinations [129]. The safety profile of ESM strengthens its potential as a candidate for various applications with the medical and food sectors.
