## (s4) Outcome.
(p4.0) To be included in an NMA, trials must include the outcome of nasal symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and nasal obstruction) [11], and the criteria for outcome evaluation must be clear. e outcome evaluation is also recommended for the standardization of clinical outcomes used in AR [11]. Outcomes on symptom improvements are reported on short 3-point Likert scales. On the basis of clinical observations, these short ordinal outcomes were dichotomized as "improvement" or "no improvement" in accordance with guidelines of the Cochrane handbook. In this study, the outcomes "markedly effective" and "effective" were grouped as "improvement," and the outcome "no improvement" classified as "nonbeneficial." Likewise, a binary assessment of global symptoms was used in the recently published systematic review of Fu et al. [10].
