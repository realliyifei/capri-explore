## (s5) Descriptive analysis and qualitative synthesis
(p5.0) We identified 98 cases of concomitant EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement in NSCLC patients from a literature search. In this paper we will describe a total of 100 cases, including our 2 patients ( Table 1). The main patient characteristics are consistent with previous findings about patients with the sole EGFR mutation or EML4-ALK translocation [52]. There is a prevalence of women (51 female, 31 male, 18 not reported), Asian (53 Asian, 30 Caucasian, 17 not reported) and never smoker patients (58 never smokers, 15 smokers, 27 not reported). We are here considering all patients treated with at least one TKI (EGFR or ALK-TKIs) and since some patients had more than one treatment with the same class of TKI we are analyzing together all treatments administered for each class (lines of therapy). Fifty one patients received at least one EGFR-TKI, with a total of 56 EGFR-TKI lines administered. Considering only the 53 EGFR-TKI lines evaluable for response, independently from the setting, disease control (CR or PR or SD) was achieved in 37 cases (69.8%) with 23 objective responses reported (43.4%). Thirty-seven patients were treated with at least one ALK-TKI (39 evaluable lines of treatment). In these patients disease control was achieved in 31 cases (79.5%)
