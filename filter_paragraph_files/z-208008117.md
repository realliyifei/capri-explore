## (s2) LITERATURE REVIEW:
(p2.0) Copper (Cu), is an essential trace element.Along with lead arsenic, mercury, cadmium etc. it is classified as a member of heavy metal group.Deficiency of copper and conversely presence of excessive amounts in the body both situations are detrimental for human health.Acute toxicity of copper predisposes to various pathological conditions and can cause death in severe cases.Chronic exposure to copper produces hepatotoxicity and neurological problems.Most of the copper compounds vividly bind to dust particles or they may be embedded in mineral component of rocks and soil.Copper gains entrance into the human body through drinking water or through respiratory tract upon inhaling dust particles that contains copper.Copper can also affect human beings in an indirect manner by dissolving in water.This soluble form of copper in water may be used in cultivation of plants or for rearing cattle and other animals and is really threatening our health.Upon release into lakes and rivers soluble copper compounds becomes attached to particles in water, approximately in one day and remain suspended for prolonged periods of time.The concentration of copper in air ranges from a few nanograms in a cubic meter of air (ng/m³) to about 200 ng/m³.This concentration may reach upto 5,000 ng/m³ in the vicinity of copper smelter industries.People residing or working near mines of copper or industries that use copper metal are exposed to increased amounts of copper in the form of copper dust.The average concentration of copper in tap water ranges from 20 to 75 ppb.However, many households have copper concentrations of over 1,000 ppb.When water sits in the pipes overnight the copper present in pipes dissolves in water and thus makes this drinking water polluted for use.We can reduce the concentration of copper by letting water flow for about fifteen to thirty seconds from the tap before using it for any purpose.Copper concentration in lake water and river water varies from 0.5 to 1,000.Copper present in gardening products for treating diseases in plants is still another source of predisposition for humans.They may come in contact with skin and may be swallowed accidentally.Soil generally contains 2 to 250 ppm copper however up to 17,000 ppm have been found near copper and brass industries.Copper dust and waste from copper smelters, grinding, welding and mining industries as well as sludge from sewage treatment plants accounts for high concentrations of copper in the soil around the industrial areas thereby affecting people living in the locality.Workers in these industries are exposed to copper by either inhaling dust contaminated with copper or by absorption of copper from epidermal layer of skin.Air borne exposure to copper at workplace must be regulated to reduce harmful effects to humans 7 .
## (s4) Pharmacodynamics of Copper
(p4.0) Copper play an important role in many oxidative processes in the human body such as produced by oxidases, cytochrome oxidase, metalloenzymes etc.In case of copper deficiency the function of these enzymes becomes erratic and thus may cause various diseases specially anemia 15,16 .Copper may also produce glucose -6-phosphate deficiency and hence a high risk of hematologic diseases 17 .Copper forms metalloprotein that is metallothionein and cytosolic copper chaperons.It activates copper-binding proteins in small peptides like albumin, ceruloplasmin, glutathione 18 .Copper undergoes entero-hepatic circulation and is excreted primarily in bile.It acts as catalyst in metabolic reactions and predisposes to mutations 19,20,21 .The copper/ zinc superoxide dismutase enzyme found in the brain, blood,, liver, lung, and thyroid is responsible for provision of protection against oxygen toxicity 22,23 .
## (s5) In born errors of Copper metabolism
(p5.0) (1) Menkes Disease: John Menkes a physician in 1962 described this disorder for the first time.It is an X-linked syndrome that has a frequency of about 1/200,000 live births.Boys are affected primarily by this disease but few girls have also been documented to be affected 28 .There is severe deficiency of copper which causes death in early years of childhood.Development and growth of brain requires certain enzymes which need copper for proper functioning and deficiency of copper is hence accompanied by severe neurological abnormalities.There is hypo-pigmentation of hairs due to lack of melanin being caused by deficiency of enzyme tyrosinase.Deficiency of cuproenzyme is also present so cross-linking of keratin does not occurs and the hair appear steely, brittle and kinky therefore also named as "kinky hair disease."The activity of cytochrome c oxidase enzyme is suppressed which causes severe neurological defects including mental retardation.Death commonly occurs in children before they reach the age of ten years.Diagnosis at an initial stage and prompt management of these individuals usually fails to defer or delay death.Absorption of copper does occurs from small intestine but there is fault in pumping out of absorbed copper into the vascular tree, liver and to other parts and organs 29,30 .
## (s6) Biological effects of copper
(p6.0) It is reported that ingestion of copper salts 20-70 gm intent-ionally or accidentally produces features as headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increased heart rate, difficulties in respiratory process, hemolytic type of anemia, presence of blood in urine, moderate to severe GIT bleeding, hepatic and renal failure and death.Acute Exposure can occur after single or repeated intake of drinking water containing copper usually above 3-6 mg/L.It produces predominantly features of acute gastrointestinal upset such as nausea, vomiting stomach irritation.Allergic features may develop in sensitive individuals upon dermal exposure.High copper level in air produces elevated serum copper levels and hepatomegaly in workers of mining and smelting industries.Copper -T and multiload are used as intrauterine devices to prevent conception.It act by producing metal toxicity to sperm and inhibits implantation of blastocyst in the uterine endometrium as well as by inhibiting embryonic development.It has been documented that chances of spontaneous abortions are quite high in untreated females having Wilson disease. 37Chronic deficiency of copper in infants and children produces features related to low RBC and WBC count.It also produces abnormalities of bone-marrow which subsides with supplements of copper.
