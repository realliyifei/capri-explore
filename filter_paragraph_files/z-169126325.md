## (s1) Background to CSR Legislation in Mauritius
(p1.0) Mauritius is a former British and French colony.Even more than three decades after independence descendants of European settlers still control private business ownership and hold the bulk of economic power (Maisenhender [6]).An inequality in income and wealth distribution is visible in Mauritius (Mahadeo et al. [7]).CSR activities of Mauritian firms can be traced back to the days where sugar production used to be the main economic activity.Sugar estates and factories were the main employer in the country and used to provide support to activities in their "factory-area".These support activities ranged from helping schools to religious donations.These were made on an ad-hoc basis and could be termed as philanthropic CSR (Soobaroyen and Mahadeo [8]).A survey by the MEF in 2007 found that the majority of businesses are of the view that pursuing their narrow economic interests should be balanced with social and environmental responsibilities.The survey also found that firms were involved in CSR activities on an ad-hoc basis which were not linked to their business operations.
## (s6) Conclusions
(p6.0) While CSR originates from developed countries, mandatory CSR has been driven by developing countries.The Mauritian CSR levy applies to all companies indistinctively, which means that companies are equally affected by the CSR levy.As such, companies can neither use CSR as a competitive edge nor can they take the public for a "free ride" by reporting CSR without actually practicing it.

(p6.1) Perhaps, one innovative way to create a competitive edge through the use of CSR is to go beyond the mandatory threshold.Internal CSR activities are no longer allowed by CSR guidelines, firms willing to carry internal CSR will have to spend more than 2% of their profit on CSR.

(p6.2) Public interest theory concludes that the CSR levy is appropriate in the Mauritian context due to "market failure".The prevailing local conditions where family businesses dominate the business scene offer no incentives for firms to engage in CSR.Pre-legislation CSR practices provide evidence of a preference for internal CSR which did not benefit society as a whole.Managers did not have to show their managerial talents by engaging in CSR to improve the firm's rating as it happens in developed countries.All elements combined, the Mauritian business environment was not conducive towards voluntary CSR.Thus legislation was warranted in the interests of the community.The CSR levy acts in the public interest to change the focus of CSR activities from internal to external.

(p6.3) Rashid and Lodh [65] showed that regulation was necessary in developing countries for firms to practise CSR.The Mauritian CSR levy has set a precedent which other countries can follow to institutionalise CSR.For instance, the Indian and Mauritian CSR levy and guidelines have many similarities.While CSR practices originated from developed countries and were quickly adopted by less developed countries (LDC), the trend on mandatory CSR has been set by LDCs.
