## (s4) Graphene-Based Electrode Materials
(p4.0) Fuel cells are a type of energy conversion device that can generate electricity as long as fuel is available. Because the chemical energy of fuels is directly transformed into electricity, fuel cells have far better system efficiency than combustion engines, as well as lower pollution emissions. As a result, fuel cells are one of the most appealing technologies for addressing global energy and environmental concerns while also making our lives cleaner and more sustainable. An electrolyte is layered between two electrodes in an atypical fuel cell [80]. On the anode surface, the fuel is oxidized, and the liberated electrons pass through an external circuit to decrease O2 at the cathode. To complete the circuit, the mobile charge carriers (H + , OH − , CO2 3− , or O 2− ) pass via electrolytes at the same time. Among various nanomaterials, GR and its derivatives have strong chemical, electrical, and mechanical capabilities, allowing them to be used as mass alternative materials in fuel cell applications. In recent years, many kinds of research have been focused on maximizing the potential usage of graphene-based materials in fuel cells. GR-based materials are
