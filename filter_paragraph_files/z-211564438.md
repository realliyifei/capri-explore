## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Sensitizing cancer cells to lower levels of NAD and NADPH pool without affecting normal cells is a novel anti-cancer strategy. The interdependence of different pathways of the pool is a difficult challenge to target them separately. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of NAD salvage pathway, is the greatest contributor in generating NAD in mammals [1,2]. Overexpression of NAMPT has been implicated in several cancers [3][4][5]. On the other hand, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) also produces NAD through the nicotinic acid pathway [1,6]. However, recent studies have shown that isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations may result in downregulation of NAPRT [7][8][9].

(p0.1) CpG islands or loss of exon 1 expression in NAPRT [7][8][9]39,40]. As a consequence, inhibition of NAPRT enzyme activity forces these cells to mainly depend on the NAD salvage pathway to generate NAD ( Figure 1) [7]. Furthermore, NAMPT is frequently amplified in some cancers which may also affect the NAD pool [3,7,42,43]. Conversely, NAMPT-specific inhibitors significantly deplete NAD levels and subsequently suppress cancer cell proliferation [7,[44][45][46]. The association between IDH1/2 mutation and NAD Production in Cancer. Mutant IDH1/2 converts α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) into D-2 hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), an oncometabolite that causes hypermethylation at CpG islands of NAPRT promoter region, results in nicotinic acid pathway inhibition. Cancer cells maintain the adequate level of NAD pool through NAD salvage pathway and NADPH generation. NADPH is used as a substrate to generate D-2HG to promote oncogenesis. One of the possible mechanisms for cancer cell survival is achieved through catalytic activity of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) that maintains folate pool and induces DNA synthesis. TCA: tricarboxylic acid; NAPRT: nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase; NAMN: nicotinic acid mononucleotide; NAAD: nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide; NADS: NAD synthase; QAPRT: quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase; NMN: nicotinamide mononucleotide; NAR: nicotinic acid riboside; NR: nicotinamide riboside; NRK1/2: nicotinamide riboside kinase 1/2; H 2 F: dihydrofolate; H 4 F: tetrahydrofolate.
## (s1) Therapeutic Role of NAMPT in Cancer
(p1.0) NAMPT, a dimeric class of type II phosphoribosyltransferases, catalyzes NMN from Nam and 5'-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) [1]. NAMPT can be found in both intracellular and extracellular environments, including cytoplasm, blood, cerebrospinal fluids, adipose tissue, hepatic tissue, pancreatic tissue and almost every organ in the human body [1,47]. Phosphorylation at His247 increases the affinity of NAMPT to Nam and NAMPT enzymatic activity for more than 1000 folds [1,48,49].

(p1.1) Increased serum concentrations of NAMPT have been linked with diseases such as obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus and in particular, cancers [35,36]. Colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, melanoma and myeloma were found to overexpress NAMPT [15,44,[50][51][52][53]. An increased NAD pool, as the consequence of NAMPT overexpression, was also associated with chemotherapeutic resistance [50,54]. Therefore, targeting NAMPT in tumors lacking NAPRT has been identified as an anti-cancer drug target. NAMPT knock-down has successfully sensitized cancer cells to increased ROS and cell death [44].
## (s2) Mutant Isocitrate Dehydrogenases Inhibit NAD Production in Cancer
(p2.0) Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) converts isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the TCA cycle with NADP + as its cofactor. IDH exists in three isozymes, namely IDH1, IDH2 and IDH3. IDH1, located in the cytosol and peroxisome, is encoded by the IDH1 gene on chromosome 2q34, while IDH2 is localized in the mitochondria and is encoded by the gene located on chromosome 15q26.1 [41]. Both enzymes are NADP-dependent, share high degree of homology and conduct a reversible reaction to maintain the isocitrate pool [12]. Unlike the other two isozymes, IDH3, localized in the mitochondria, exists as a heterocomplex enzyme consisting of α, β, and γ subunits that are encoded by IDH3A (15q25.1), IDH3B (20p13), and IDH3C (Xq28) genes, respectively [41]. IDH3 is activated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inhibited by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In order to ensure the continuity of TCA cycle, IDH3 conducts the irreversible conversion of isocitrate to maintain the α-KG pool [12,41,81].
## (s4) Therapeutic Role of NAD Kinase
(p4.0) Cancer cells depend on the availability of NADPH to provide defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) that is generated from cancer proliferating activity [86]. The formation of NADPH is catalyzed by NAD Kinase (NADK) and dehydrogenases which convert NAD to NADP and NADP to NADPH, respectively [87]. NADK was discovered by Kornberg in 1950 after Vestin, von Euler and Adler observed NADP formation in yeast [87]. Since then, NADK has been found in algae, high-level plants, and animals, including monkey, rabbit, chicken liver and ground squirrels [87][88][89]. NADK was found in almost all human organs except skeletal muscle. It is localized in the cytoplasm and recently a mitochondrial enzyme has been described [90][91][92][93]. The cytoplasmic enzyme consists of four subunit polypeptides and optimally works at temperature of 55 • C and pH 7.5 [90,91]. NADK requires NAD and ATP and a divalent metal ion such as zinc, manganese and magnesium [90]. NADK has also been observed to play a role in physiology and pathophysiology of diseases, including cancers [92,[94][95][96]. NADK generates NADPH that is important to scavenge ROS, and promote cell longevity [97,98]. Thus, targeting NADK in cancer has been recognized as another potential anti-cancer target [10].

(p4.1) NADK is inhibited by thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADS) and thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPS) [10,11,86]. The prodrug thionicotinamide, (TN) is converted into NADS and NADPS intracellularly and acts as dual inhibitor of NADK and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) that catalyzes NADPH production. Reducing intracellular NADPH results in an increase in ROS [10,11]. Reduction of NADP + by dehydrogenases produces NADPH the substrate for glutathione reductase and mediates the production 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), the substrate for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine. Depletion of NADPH puts cancer cells in higher oxidative state and limits availability of nucleic acid for DNA replication.

(p4.2) TN successfully delayed tumor growth in xenograft mouse models of colon cancer and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and in vitro synergized with other ROS-inducing chemotherapeutic agents [10]. As mutant IDH requires NADPH to produce D-2HG, thus, a NADK inhibitor might be a novel therapeutic approach for treating mutant IDH cancer cells to decrease the NADPH pool which may not be sufficient to facilitate the production of the D-2HG oncometabolite.
## (s5) NADPH Stabilizes Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR)
(p5.0) DHFR catalyzes the reduction of folic acid and dihydrofolate (H 2 F) to tetrahydrofolate (H 4 F), utilizing NADPH as a cofactor and is important enzyme for de-novo-purine and thymidine biosynthesis [99]. The discovery of methotrexate as a competitive inhibitor of DHFR opened many avenues for cancer therapeutic purposes [100]. To understand the mechanism of methotrexate resistance in cancers or up-regulation of DHFR in such cancers, it became evident that the interaction of DHFR with its co-factor NADPH plays a key role to regulate its interaction as well as its expression [11,101].

(p5.1) DHFR exists in two interconvertible conformers, one binding to its mRNA and regulates its translation and other conformer binds to NADPH to regulate its function as well [99]. The binding of methotrexate to DHFR-NADPH conformer leads to inhibition of its catalytic function, however binding to other conformer was found to shift the chemical equilibrium towards releasing the DHFR from its own mRNA and thus resulting in DHFR translation. Different studies [101,102] supported that the NADPH binding domain regulates DHFR translation. DHFR mutants (both catalytic or NADPH binding) alter its binding with its substrate or co-factors and modify its regulation [99,101]. Recently our group showed that targeting NADK by TN caused a decrease of NADPH which destabilized DHFR and caused its degradation [10,11]. Thus, lowering levels of DHFR may play a role in the anticancer activity of TN [10,11,99,103]. Targeting the NADPH pool via DHFR inhibition opens another window in cancer therapeutics.
## (s6) Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (MTHFD) Maintains NADP/NADPH Pools in Cancer
(p6.0) MTHFD2 is an enzyme that is required for tumor cell survival [104]. MTHFD2 is highly expressed in the mitochondria and nucleus of multiple types of tumor cells, but not in non-transformed cells [104]. The only non-transformed cell induction of MTHFD2 was observed in lymphocyte activation, indicating the role of MTHFD2 in normal hematopoietic cells as well as in the tumorigenesis process of hematologic malignancies [105].
## (s7) Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) Maintains NADP/NADPH Pools in Cancer
(p7.0) SHMT2 is a mitochondrial enzyme that converts serine into glycine simultaneously converting tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methylene-H 4 F [105,111]. SHMT2 plays an important role in folate metabolism as serine is a dominant source of 1C unit [111]. Increased regulation of mitochondrial 1C elevates the production of 1C unit, biosynthesis of adenosine, guanosine, thymidylate and remethylation of homocystein to support methionine cycle [111,112]. The accumulated 1C units are important to support folate metabolism which regenerates the redox cofactors NADPH, NADH and ATP [112].

(p7.1) Overexpression of SHMT2 has been found in cancers and associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients [111,113]. However, it is not sufficient to cause malignant transformation alone [114]. Increased expression in mRNA and protein of SHMT2 was found in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Downregulating SHMT2, either by shRNA knock down, SHMT2 silencing, or inhibition using L-mimosine, suppressed tumor growth and increased chemotherapeutic sensitivity [114,115]. SHMT2 knockdown leads to decreased NADPH and impaired cancer survival [116]. Impairment of folate metabolism will decrease the production of NADPH, NADH, ATP and further cause cell death [112]. Therefore, SHMT2 is a potential target in cancer therapeutics. Targeting SHMT2 disturbs the homeostasis of NADP/NADPH pool which is important in cancer survival.
## (s8) Targeting Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) Sensitizes Cancer
(p8.0) Aldehyde dehydrogenases are groups of NAD-dependent enzymes in the ALDH superfamily that consists of 19 different NADP-dependent ALDH enzymes. ALDHs are localized in both cytosol and mitochondria [117]. Crystallographic analysis has shown that ALDH has a specific coenzyme NAD binding domain. This implies that NAD is a significant component required by ALDH to execute its functions in retinoic acid biosynthesis, GABA neurotransmitter metabolism and alcohol metabolism [117].

(p8.1) ALDH1A3, a member of ALDH1A subfamily, is associated with cancer incidence, progression, prognosis and chemotherapeutic resistance [117][118][119]. The gene encoding ALDH1A3 consists of 16 exons and is located on chromosome 15q26.3. It is localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondria [119,120]. This enzyme converts all-trans-retinal into retinoic acid [119,121,122]. ALDH catalytic reactions produce vast amount of cytosolic NADH as the source of ATP generation in cancers [123]. ALDH1A3 also plays a role in generating acetic acid from acetaldehyde in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis as well as metabolizing amino acids, exogenous chemical substances via cytochrome P450 and lipid peroxidase product [119,121]. ALDH1A3 catalyzes peroxidation, a process that produces fatty aldehyde, an intermediate compound in producing fatty acid and NADPH [119,124]. ALDH1A3 indirectly regulates apoptosis through retinoic acid pathway by increasing expression of caspase-7 and caspase-9 [119,125].
## (s9) Conclusions
(p9.0) Exploring NAD biogenesis for cancer therapeutics had been studied for decades [24,25,35,91,92,94]. The NAD pool in cells is contributed by the simultaneous functioning of various pathways as mentioned in this review, viz-a-viz, NA pathway, de novo pathway and NAD salvage pathway. The malfunctioning of the enzymes in any of these pathways may alter the NAD pool of cells. Cancer cells attempt to maintain the NAD pool. In some cancers, the rate limiting enzyme of one of the NAD biogenesis pathways may be over expressed or a mutation in one pathway may alter the turn-over of the other pathway to sustain the NAD pool. Different metabolic enzymes including NAMPT, NAPRT, IDH, NADK, DHFR, MTHFD, SHMT and ALDH, are dysregulated in various cancer types, making them potential anti-cancer targets. Mutations in some NAD and NADPH metabolic enzymes cause epigenetic regulation and affect expression of different genes involved in different cellular processes. Thus, targeting different rate limiting enzymes alone or in combination opens many therapeutic opportunities to treat cancers.
