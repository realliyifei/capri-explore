## (s1) MATERIALS AND METHODS
(p1.0) PHEV charging strategies: Charging profiles is a major factor that affects distribution networks prior to vehicle charging.Charging EVs by using the supply grid significantly affects the levels of voltage.Thus, approach and control methods of charging EVs must be studied.Different charging strategies could be considered to manage the time and frequency of EV charging:

(p1.1) In studying PHEV charging, no single impact study can represent or be applicable to any utility grid or country because of unpredictable PHEV charging patterns and diversity of PHEV circuit characteristics from one circuit to another.Moreover, lack of indispensable data, such as charging patterns and penetration levels, may increase the uncertainty.Table 1 shows the different penetration levels of uncoordinated charging indifferent countries.Two main perspectives can represent the initiation and worsening of impacts on the distribution grid.

(p1.2) From the consumer perspective, vehicle batteries should be charged to allow driver to use the vehicle with a full battery.PHEV batteries could be recharged at home, public car park, or work place.Regardless of the optimal recharging location, the main issue is the  uncoordinated power consumption, which may exist as a consequence of uncertain charging behavior and may result in grid deficiency.The impacts of these vehicles to the distribution grid could be mainly attributed to the large-scale consumption of electrical energy and this demand could possibly result in extra-large and undesirable peaks in energy consumption.The main impact of these extra single-phase electrical loads can be analyzed in terms of power losses and voltage unbalances.From the point of view of the distribution system operator, power losses during charging is an economic concern and transformer and feeder overloads are reliability and safety concerns (Farmer et al., 2010).

(p1.3) Power quality (e.g., voltage profile, unbalance and harmonics) is essential to the distribution grid operator and grid customers.Voltage deviations are regarded as a definite power quality concern (Geth et al., 2012).In this regard, measuring these voltage imbalances over a distribution grid caused by wide electricity consumption for charging PEVs is the central procedure in developing solutions, such as "smart" or "coordinated charging".
## (s5) Renewable modeling
(p5.0) Trip modeling Findings Bashash and Fathy (2014) Provided further elaboration of the PHEVs possible constraints such as existing idle battery capacity, energy price and remaining charging time.In addition, the proposed framework was implemented to show the impacts of bidirectional V2G power flow as well as the updated hourly prices due to the PHEV battery's resistance during optimal charging.
## (s7) Fazelpour et al. (2014)
(p7.0) Proposed optimization to assess integrating PHEVs with renewable energy resource (RES).He performed that by using the genetic algorithms (Gas).Centralized charging control architectures: These architectures were built based on scheduling procedures, which also consider the requirements of individual charging jobs.These paradigms often rely on planned schedules, which are communicated through a central scheduling instance or assume a Direct Load Control (DLC) scheme to organize the overall charging process, thereby obtaining particular technical constraints (Gonzalez Vaya and Andersson, 2012).
## (s12) Impact of PHEV on Electrical Power System (EPS):
(p12.0) An electric grid consists of generation, transmission and distribution systems.The generation system is composed of power plants that generate electricity from a variety of sources, such as coal, gas, solar and wind.The impact of PEV charging on the electric grid as a whole is mainly influenced by two aspects:

(p12.1) • Level of PEV penetration • Point in time and duration of PEV charging Many studies have been performed to analyze the potential impact of large-scale integration of EVs into the existing power system.Study on integration of EVs into the grid was first started in the1980s.In Heydt (1983) found that the charging demand of EVs coincides with the overall peak load.This study mainly focused on estimating the possible impacts on loads in different regions when the penetration growth rate of EVs changes.Results showed that uncoordinated charging scenarios of EVs occur along with the peak load on the grid, thereby affecting the performance of the grid.

(p12.2) Several papers reported the potential impacts of PHEVs without coordination on the charging behavior.A prominent and detailed study was conducted in Portugal; according to Camus et al. (2009), the power capacity of the Portuguese EPS may be inadequate if uncontrolled charging were conducted even at low penetration levels.
## (s13) Power loss:
(p13.0) The portuguese DS analyzed by Lopes et al. (2011) would experience problems with voltage drops and power loss at penetration levels below 10% if no controls were applied.Simulations were conducted in PSS/E by considering the average drive distance; the charge time would be calculated according to the electricity consumed/day instead of according to the size of the battery, which is also important to obtain reliable results.Instead of charging daily, charging was performed when the battery was assumed empty.Impact assessment of EVs was extensively presented by Torquato et al. (2014) by using two operation methods.Voltage drop, increase losses and cable overload were the main core impacts of PHEV connection on the distribution network.A privileged and prominent study of PHEV impacts on power quality in electrical distribution system was conducted by Gray and Morsi (2015).Saberbari et al. (2014) also evaluated PHEV impacts on the distribution grid in Iran with regard to power loss and voltage drop.Results emphasized the importance of having a coordinated plan for PHEVs, particularly during peak time; otherwise, PHEVs would disrupt grid strategies, decrease voltage and increase power losses.Another study conducted by Baharin and Abdullah (2013) revealed the potential impact of largescale adoption of PHEV in Malaysia residential area.Geographic information system simulation software was used to identify and investigate the impact of different penetration levels of PHEVs on selected residential network.Cable size upgrading would significantly improve power losses.
## (s16) Transformer overloading:
(p16.0) The possible impact of charging PHEVs on a typical distribution feeder in Blacksburg, VA was studied by Shao et al. (2009); two PHEVs (Chevrolet) and five homes were examined using two strategies: charging PHEVs at 6 p.m. and charging PHEVs at off-peak hours.The first scenario was the worst and the test concluded that the transformer load increased to 68%/52%.The second one resulted in increasing the transformer load to a slightly lesser percentage than the first case with 58%/52%.Farmer et al. (2010) discussed PHEV effects on transformer; three different scenarios could possibly occur upon adoption of PHEV on a power grid.Introduction of power electronics increased the harmonics because the load increased, followed by an increase in the transformer temperature.This phenomenon will lead to wear and tear on the transformer bushings because of the flattened load efforts.Other researchers, such as Khamphanchai et al. (2014), proposed a decentralized voltage control algorithm to identify the possible EV penetration impact on load and voltage profiles in a distribution transformer.In this study, the nodal voltage was stabilized in a distribution transformer within the acceptable limit to prevent load profile and transformer overload.The results illustrated that EV penetration enhanced transformer load and decreased voltage beyond the acceptable limit.
## (s17) Challenges of PHEV battery charger topologies:
(p17.0) As operation of EV battery charger is dependent on electronic components and control strategy, it must be emphasized.Over the last years, many studies proposed a variety of circuit topologies and control strategies associated with their designs.The two types of EV charging are:

(p17.1) The first topology is considered the conventional type, with a diode rectifier as its first stage.In this topology, the local reactive power can reduce the complexity of managing and controlling heavy loads.A bidirectional charger can also operate in two different modes: G2Vreferred to as charging mode and Vehicle to Grid (V2G) referred to as discharging mode.Many researchers extensively studied the possible charging impact on the distribution network.Niazazari et al. (2014) improved the power factor and voltage profile during PHEV charging and proposed a probabilistic model, including specific parameters, such as daily travelled distance and battery size or capacity.Frequency deviation during PHEV charging and discharging on the grid system was extensively elaborated by Pahasa and Ngamroo (2015); they presented the model predictive control to effectively stabilize the frequency on grid system and produce the desired value of the state of charge.
## (s19) Renewable Energy Source (RES):
(p19.0) Several studies mainly focused on the integration of RES and how far it could provide power and energy balancing and flattening the daily load profile.Rotering and Ilic (2011) and Ma et al. (2012) used intelligent charging and discharging methods to emphasize previously discussed issues.Other researchers, such as Khodayar et al. (2012), integrated EVs and wind energy in a power system by using a specific model called Stochastic SCUC.Nevertheless, challenges and hindrance sexist when integrating V2G concept by determining benefits and other issues, such as profits.All of these aspects were revealed and elaborated by Mullan et al. (2012) and Yilmaz and Krein (2013).Some studies mainly focused on exposing the most optimal techniques for allocating power to each of PHEV that go to the charging station (Rahman et al., 2014).Shaaban and El-Saadany (2014) proposed a multi-objective planning algorithm that confers the capability of adapting scenarios of high penetration of EVs, along with the injection of renewable distributed generation.The main contributions of the study were developing a probabilistic annual model of energy consumption for a fleet of EVs based on the Monte Carlo simulation and investigation of renewable distributed interaction units along with the requirements of EV load.Another research study presented the expected impact of EVs by considering probability of occurrence (Elnozahy et al., 2014).Fazelpour et al. (2014) also proposed an optimization method to assess integrating PHEV RES by using genetic algorithms.The result indicated a noticeable alleviation in real power losses and improvement of voltage profile in the distribution lines.
