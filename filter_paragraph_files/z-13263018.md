## (s2) Structure of various congeners of pyrazolopyridine with PDE4B inhibitory activity
(p2.0) The structure-activity relationship is further exemplified by varying the substituent at first position of the pyrazolopyridine ring 2. However, the simple alkyl and aryl substituent on first position did not yield selective PDE4B inhibitors, except for the hydroxyethyl substituent in the pyrazolopyridine derivative 2e, which exhibited a similar pIC 50 of 6.8 as that of the lead molecule. Introduction of the amide function at fifth position retained PDE4B selectivity and secondary amides were well-tolerated because of their lipophilic nature, while benzyl amide derivative 3a and saturated analogues such as 3b showed enhanced inhibitory activity on PDE4B with pIC 50 values of 8.5 and 8.1, respectively. Primary amide 3c showed significant inhibition (pIC 50
