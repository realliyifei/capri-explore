## (s3) MRI Safety During Pregnancy
(p3.0) MRI is generally considered safe for pregnant women. However, there are some important considerations. The main concern regarding MRI during pregnancy is the potential risk to the developing foetus associated with the strong magnetic fields used in the procedure. There is no evidence to suggest that MRI poses any direct risk to the foetus [8].
## (s6) Gadolinium and the Periconception Period
(p6.0) The periconception period, which includes the time before conception and the first few weeks of pregnancy, is a critical window for foetal development. Therefore, understanding the effects of gadolinium exposure during this time is crucial to ensuring the health and safety of both the mother and the foetus. De Santis et al. [24] examined the impact of GBCA exposure during the periconceptional period and found no major adverse effects on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, particularly during the first trimester. However, the sample size in this study was small at only 26 pregnant women, which limits the generalisability of the results. Therefore, further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these findings.

(p6.1) In a larger study, Ray et al. [2] investigated the risk of congenital anomalies and other adverse pregnancy outcomes following gadolinium exposure in the periconception period. They analysed data from 397 pregnancies and found no significant association between GBCA exposure and the risk of major congenital anomalies. However, they observed a small increased risk of stillbirth or neonatal death. These findings suggest that while gadolinium exposure during the periconception period may not be associated with a high risk of congenital anomalies, there may be other potential risks that warrant further investigation.
