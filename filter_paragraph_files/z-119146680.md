## (s7) Evolution systems of invariant measures
(p7.0) Evolution systems of invariant measures (also called entrance laws at −∞ in [22]) are the nonautonomous counterpart of invariant measure. By definition an evolution system of invariant measures is a one parameter family of probability measures {µ s : s ∈ I} such that

(p7.1) for any s, t ∈ I, with s < t and any f ∈ C b (R N ). A sufficient condition ensuring the existence of an evolution system of invariant systems is a variant of the Has'minskii criterion of the autonomous case. More precisely, 

(p7.2) Then, there exists an evolution system of invariant measure of (P (t, s)).  (c) ∇ x b(t, x)ξ, ξ ≤ C(t)|ξ| 2 for any t ∈ I, and x, ξ ∈ R N .

(p7.3) A straightforward computation reveals that, for any m ∈ N, the function ϕ : R N → R, defined by ϕ(x) = 1 + |x| 2m for any x ∈ R N , satisfies Condition (4.2) for some s 0 ∈ I.

(p7.4) The main difference with the classical Has'minskii criterion is that this latter just requires that the function A ϕ tends to −∞ as |x| → +∞ without any condition on the way it diverges to −∞.

(p7.5) It is worth noting that Condition (4.2) is assumed only in a neighborhood of +∞ and not in the whole of I. Indeed, if the family {µ s : s ∈ I} satisfies (4.1), then µ s = P (t, s) * µ t for any s < t, s ∈ I, where P (t, s) * denotes the adjoint to the operator P (t, s). Hence, the measures µ s are uniquely determined by µ t through the evolution operator. The main issue is, thus, the proof of the existence of µ t for t large.

(p7.6) We mention that the existence of an evolution system of invariant measures has been proved also in [10], under different assumptions on the coefficients of the operator A , and in [20], for a class of nonautonomous elliptic operators, obtained by perturbing the drift coefficients of an autonomous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator by a function F : R 1+N → R, which is, roughly speaking, Lipschitz continuous in x uniformly with respect to s and of dissipative type.

(p7.7) As a matter of fact, the evolution systems of invariant measures are infinitely many in general, this being in contrast to the autonomous case where the invariant measure is unique whenever the semigroup (T (t)) associated with the autonomous operator A is strong Feller and irreducible (properties that (T (t)) fulfills under very weak assumptions on the coefficients of the operator A ).
