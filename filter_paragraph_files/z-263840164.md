## (s2) Samples with Differences
(p2.0) Through the analysis of the published literature, it is found that single herbs have attracted much attention as the research hotspot, accounting for more than 70% of the research objects of the spectrum-effect relationships (Figure 2).At present, in the research on the spectrum-effect relationships of TCM, the samples are mostly from different batches, different cultivating regions or different manufacturers, and the samples from the same source can also be used to facilitate the follow-up difference treatment.For the samples with different sources, due to the differences in composition and efficacy, it is usually enough to use the same method to treat each sample separately.For example, different batches of Artemisia frigida Willd.[11] and Saposhnikoviae Radix [12] of different origins are pre-treated with the same method.In the process of sample pretreatment, it is the ultimate goal to select the effective parts and retain the effective components to the maximum extent [13].Furthermore, for samples from a single source, sample pretreatment is mainly for purposeful manufacturing of component differences.For example, samples with differences are prepared by different extraction methods or processing methods, and the active component screening is completed by looking for differences in the spectral effect relationship between them [14,15].the active component screening is completed by looking for differences in the spectral effect relationship between them [14,15].For the spectrum-effect relationships of formulas and preparations of TCM, one or a group of drugs can be gradually removed from the formula, and then the efficacy of the remaining drugs can be investigated to obtain the efficacy of the removed drugs on the whole formula, through which the interaction of a single drug in the formula and preparation can be explored, as well as the best combination of multiple drugs can be found.For instance, Lan et al. revealed the qualitative and quantitative contributions of eight kinds of herbs in Zhizi Jinhua pills by prescription and decomposition analysis [16].In addition, through the research of the spectrum-effect relationships of the formula and preparation from different batches, the main active components can also be discussed.Similar studies have been used in Banxia Baizhu Tianma decoction [17], compound licorice tablets [18] and Tianmeng oral liquid [19].
## (s4) Evaluation Based on Pharmacodynamics
(p4.0) The effects and mechanisms of TCM on the body are complex, and the synergistic effects of multi-components, multi-targets and multi-pathways determine that it is not a small challenge to find an appropriate pharmacodynamic evaluation method.How to establish an appropriate pharmacodynamic evaluation method can be summarized as follows: select an appropriate, rapid, and recognized pharmacodynamic evaluation model and pharmacodynamic indicators with high stability and good reproducibility for follow-up experiments.Animal models or in vitro organs are often used to observe the intuitive efficacy of drugs.Cell culture and biochemical experiments are usually used to study the mechanism of action.Herein, we summarize the application of different types of pharmacological models and different pharmacodynamic indexes in the study of spectrum-effect relationships in the past 20 years (Figure 3).

(p4.1) Current pharmacodynamic studies are mainly based on animal, organ, cell, molecular and other pharmacological models.Compared with the animal integrity level, the other three studies do not take into account the overall regulation of TCM on the body, nor the complex process of TCM absorption, metabolism, and distribution in the body.In addition, animals at the holistic level were more representative when responding to traditional efficacy such as "reinforce kidney to strengthening Yang" [24], "invigorating blood and dissolving stasis" [45], and "spleen-invigorating and anti-swelling" [46].Therefore, at present, a large number of studies on spectrum-effect relationships have adopted the whole animal model, including rats, mice, zebrafish, etc.This model's advantage is that it ensures the integrity of the body and the normal contact environment with the outside world.At the same time, this model aligns well with the subsequent clinical research.In the research of spectrum-effect relationships, as shown in Figure 3, the proportion of animal models was about 38.41%, higher than 1.96% for organ models, 27.22% for cell models, and 24.58% for molecular models respectively.However, the disadvantages of in vivo models are their high cost, long consumption time, and difficulty in establishing animal models with all the characteristics of human disease prototypes when the diseases under study have complex pathogenic mechanisms.
## (s5) Evaluation Based on Pharmacodynamics
(p5.0) The effects and mechanisms of TCM on the body are complex, and the synergistic effects of multi-components, multi-targets and multi-pathways determine that it is not a small challenge to find an appropriate pharmacodynamic evaluation method.How to establish an appropriate pharmacodynamic evaluation method can be summarized as follows: select an appropriate, rapid, and recognized pharmacodynamic evaluation model and pharmacodynamic indicators with high stability and good reproducibility for followup experiments.Animal models or in vitro organs are often used to observe the intuitive efficacy of drugs.Cell culture and biochemical experiments are usually used to study the mechanism of action.Herein, we summarize the application of different types of pharmacological models and different pharmacodynamic indexes in the study of spectrum-effect relationships in the past 20 years (Figure 3).In vitro experiments at the organ, cell and molecular levels can directly reflect the pharmacodynamic activity of TCM because the target part can be separated from the complex in vivo environment.In addition, it can also alleviate the low-throughput problem of pharmacodynamic detection.These in vitro pharmacodynamic methods have been applied in many scenarios because of their low cost, short consumption time, good repeatability and easier to obtain perfect experimental data, such as nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory assays for measuring anti-inflammatory activity [37]; 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-thiazolyl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay for determining anti-bacterial activities [47]; and 1,1-diphenyl-2-trinitrophenylhydrazine (DPPH), 2,2'-diazide-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay for evaluating antioxidant activity [48].Therefore, this may also be one of the reasons why the application of antioxidant effects in the research of spectrum-effect relationships accounted for as high as 18.28% (Figure 3).Nevertheless, these single models also separate the overall role of the body, and there are still some limitations in many pathological models.
## (s7) Methods to Clarify the Contribution of Each Component to Efficacy
(p7.0) It is difficult for the above four chemometric methods to describe the contribution rate of each component in the fingerprints to efficacy.The regression model of each peak and pharmacodynamic data can be established by the regression analysis method to measure the contribution rate of active components to the pharmacodynamic data, among which MLR and PLSR are the two commonly used methods.

(p7.1) By establishing regression models with multiple independent variables and a single variable, MLR performs a parameter evaluation on the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, which is a useful method to quantify the relationship between spectrum and bioactivities [33].When establishing the linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable, stepwise regression is often adopted to complete the screening of the independent variable to simplify the computational complexity; however, the pharmacodynamic relationship of chromatographic peaks not selected into the model will be ignored.However, when there are multiple linear relationships between the independent variables or the number of samples is small, MLR cannot guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the established spectral effect model, in which case PLSR can be used [56].

(p7.2) When the internal variables are highly linearly correlated, PLSR is more effective and can better solve the problem that the number of samples is less than the number of variables.It not only makes maximum use of data information but also has the advantages of small computation, high prediction accuracy, and easy qualitative interpretation [57].Moreover, in orthogonal projections to latent structure (OPLS), the first latent variable is calculated using a linear combination of manifest variables defined in the direction of the highest co-variance with the response.The following latent variables are defined in the direction of the remaining variance (not co-variance) around the first, the plain between the first and second.The discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model between the chemical composition expression and the sample class is used to realize the prediction of the sample class, which is suitable for the separation between the two groups of samples and the mining of differential variables.The contribution of variables to the model can be explored through the variable importance in projection (VIP) value.The larger the VIP value (generally more than 1.0), the greater the contribution [58,59].By screening the VIP values of different compounds, it is easy to find active compounds with high correlation coefficients with pharmacological indexes.
## (s12) Exploration of Drug-Containing Serum of TCM
(p12.0) The direct analysis method of serum fingerprints can exclude the influence of body metabolism on TCM, which could better reflect the pharmacodynamic material basis of preparations and is a more effective means to determine the pharmacodynamic material basis (Table 5).Black ginseng is a processed product of ginseng.Rats were administered intragastrically with black ginseng extract to obtain the drug-containing serum.The antiproliferation effect of prostate cancer cells has been detected by MMT assay, and the effective components of anti-prostate cancer in black ginseng have been confirmed by spectrum-effect relationships [102].Zhang et al. determined the plasma fingerprints of rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion dosed with Yangyin Tongnao Granules at different time points by HPLC.They detected the changes in the levels of inflammatory factors under medicated plasma at different time points [103].Six components correlate with the inflammation index by studying spectrum-effect relationships.The strategy based on the spectrum-effect relationships of the drug-containing serum is also used to screen the effective components of the protective effect on the glomerulus of Fangji Huangqi Tang [21] and the anti-hepatoma effect of Dahuang Zhechong Pill [104].In addition, the spectrum-effect relationships can also be applied to the research of toxic or side-effectrelated components of TCM to control the quality it from the perspective of drug safety.Shuang Huang Lian injection is an effective Chinese medicine in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection, but it causes many severe anaphylactic reactions.By injecting the preparation into the caudal vein of rats, serum samples were obtained in vivo, and the spectrum-effect relationship was studied [105].Chlorogenic and other components were identified as anaphylactoid components in the preparation, which guided the screening of allergic components in other TCM preparations.
## (s14) Efficacy Verification by Monomeric Compound and Component Knock-Out
(p14.0) In the study of spectrum-effect relationships, some chromatographic peaks with pharmacodynamic activity are screened by stoichiometric methods, and researchers often complete the qualitative analysis of compounds by the retention time of standard substances, mass spectrometry identification and other technologies to verify the accuracy of the results.However, there are still some cases where the chromatographic peaks fail to achieve structural identification, which is defective for the results of spectrum-effect relationships.For active ingredients whose structures have been determined, efficacy tests can be conducted again by recombining single or multiple selected ingredients to verify whether there is bioactive equivalence between the candidate active ingredients and the original TCM, which can be referred to existing reports [106,107].In recent years, another efficacy verification strategy based on the "knock-out" method has been applied to study spectrum-effect relationships.After determining the pharmacodynamic substances of TCM, the active substances are removed from the TCM by component "knock-out", and the pharmacodynamic changes of TCM after the removal of the pharmacodynamic substances are investigated [108,109].In this way, the pharmacodynamic role of the compounds have pharmacodynamic characteristics in TCM is further clarified, which is also a supplement to the validation of the active ingredient in the study of the spectrum-effect relationships.
## (s15) Mechanism Exploration Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking
(p15.0) Network pharmacology based on the "multi-component, multi-target, multi-pathway" paradigm is a new pattern of drug research to analyze the relationship between drugs, targets, and metabolic pathways by building a network model [110].The combination of network pharmacology and spectrum-effect relationship studies can establish drug-targetpathway networks of active ingredients and predict the effects of these active ingredients on some key targets and their pathways to explore the pharmacodynamic mechanism.For example, to explore the pharmacodynamic material basis of the Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen et C. Ling rhizome for removing blood stasis, the target sites and metabolic pathways of the 10 components in plasma were predicted by network pharmacology [111].The networks predicted that 80 targets were closely related to 10 components, among which 48 targets were related to 159 metabolic pathways such as arachidonic acid metabolism, sphingolipid signaling pathway and linoleic acid metabolism.However, although network pharmacology illustrates the association between "component-target-pathway", it mostly lacks experimental correlation verification.
