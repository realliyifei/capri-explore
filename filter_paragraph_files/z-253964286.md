## (s8) Exercise Training and Activation of mTOR Protein
(p8.0) Rehabilitation exercise training, including resistance training, endurance training, functional training, and stretching training, can significantly increase the synthesis of skeletal muscle protein in the recovery phase after training [22,32]. Relevant studies have shown that skeletal muscle protein synthesis is mainly achieved by activating the PI3K/PKB/mTOR (physiologically linositide 3-kinase/PKB/mTOR) pathway [27,28]. After the old rats were given weight bearing exercise or used electric stimulation to cause muscle contraction, the activation level of PKB and the phosphorylation level of mTOR protein could be significantly improved, and the phosphorylation of GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) could also be promoted [24,33]. It is found that GSK3 is another protein that can regulate muscle hypertrophy. GSK3 protein will be phosphorylated by PKB protein, which will inhibit its own activity, thus activating eIF2B (eucaryotic translation initiation factor 2B) and, finally, increasing muscle protein synthesis. After rehabilitation exercise training, the activity of eIF2B will be significantly improved, so the effect of improving activity is consistent with that of increasing muscle protein synthesis [29,42]. In conclusion, at present, more and more evidence points out that exercise training can increase the protein synthesis of muscle cells and improve muscle quality, mainly by activating the mammalian rapamycin target protein (mTOR) information system in muscle cells so that the ribosome can improve the protein translation efficiency and further increase the skeletal muscle protein synthesis ability [31]. Moreover, the phenomenon of muscle protein synthesis caused by a single exercise can last for several hours [43]. Although the rate of muscle protein synthesis will increase within 1-2 h after exercise, long-term exercise will also cause the oxidation of amino acids in the body, thereby antagonizing the benefits of exercise stimulating protein synthesis.
## (s11) Rehabilitation Effect of "Amino Acid and Protein Nutrition" Supplement on CVA Patients
(p11.0) Rabadi et al. [13] found that, during the clinical rehabilitation period of malnourished patients with acute CVA, three times of daily nutrition supplement (5 g protein/time) will help to promote the recovery of action function. Esmarck et al. used progressive resistance exercise (3 times/week, 12 weeks in total) with nutritional supplement (10 g of milk/bean protein) to compare the efficacy of immediate supplement after exercise with that of 2 h supplement after exercise. The results showed that the cross-sectional area of quadriceps femoris, in the immediate supplement group after exercise, increased by 6.77%, and the average muscle fiber range increased by 24.01% [60,65]. In terms of the difference in the effects of supplementing different protein types, the relevant research found that [66], compared with the equal calorie formula containing casein, the enteral nutrition formula containing whey protein can more effectively reduce the systemic inflammatory reaction of elderly patients with acute stroke and increase the antioxidant capacity, which proves that the ability of whey protein in anti-inflammation is significantly better than that of casein. However, soy protein supplementation can accelerate the muscle protein synthesis rate, which is close to whey protein supplementation and is even better than casein supplementation [67,68]. On the other hand, Scherbakov et al. [56] studied that, during hospitalization, patients with acute CVA were given essential amino acid supplements three times a day (4 g essential amino acid/time). After 8 weeks, they did not find that this nutritional supplement strategy could significantly improve the muscle atrophy of CVA patients. Carlsson et al. [59] also found that the elderly did not significantly promote the increase in muscle strength or functional recovery when adding protein.

(p11.1) Based on the above results, the effect of exercise rehabilitation combined with "amino acid plus protein nutrition" for CVA patients is still controversial at present. The reason may be that different researchers use different nutritional supplement doses, time nodes, etc., and it may also be related to the difference in resistance strength. However, most of the empirical results for patients with acute CVA seem to be inclined to exercise rehabilitation combined with "soy protein or whey protein", which seems to be more helpful to improve their muscle mass, muscle strength, reduce inflammatory reaction, as well as improve antioxidant capacity and rehabilitation exercise adaptation benefits. However, at present, there are few studies on this aspect, and more clinical rehabilitation experiments need to be carried out by future scholars.
## (s13) Analysis of Negative Effect of Exercise Training Combined with Nutrition Supplement on CVA Patients' Rehabilitation
(p13.0) Walking is one of the most commonly used rehabilitation methods for CVA patients. However, even the simplest walking exercise may bring negative benefits to some CVA patients if the prescription intensity is not appropriate [77]. The lower limb muscles are in continuous stretching/shortening (eccentric centripetal, that is, SSC contraction) contraction during walking, so this rapid muscle contraction mode will lead to muscle damage, but long-term SSC training will significantly improve the performance and muscle hypertrophy of young adult rats [78]. However, when carrying out the same SSC training for aging rats, it will lead to decreased exercise performance and inflammatory reaction of cells. If the duration is longer, it may lead to inadaptable effects such as muscle function loss and muscle mass loss [79]. The latest research shows that [80], the older the subjects are, the more systemic inflammatory reaction and higher oxidative pressure will occur during a long period of moderate intensity muscle contraction speed and intermittent SSC training, which will lead to poor recovery ability of muscle injury and discomfort in muscle strength training. Sanchez Moreno et al. [73] discussed the relationship between the basic antioxidant capacity and the inflammatory response of CVA patients. The results showed that the plasma vitamin C concentration of CVA patients decreased significantly, accompanied by a significant increase in serum inflammatory indicators (C-reactive protein, etc.) and the concentration of oxidative pressure markers, indicating that there was a significant correlation between the decline of systemic antioxidant capacity of CVA patients and stroke related inflammatory response. Although a large number of studies have shown that exercise combined with nutrition supplement is beneficial to promote muscle growth or increase muscle strength, in the face of CVA patients, it may be affected by factors such as muscle degradation or muscle disuse, resulting in passivation reaction [29,80,81] (also known as "anabolic impedance phenomenon"), which makes muscles unable to maintain their muscle protein content by properly stimulating protein synthesis and leads to sarcopenia in the process of degeneration. It is also pointed out that, even though CVA patients receive rehabilitation treatment, there are still about 30-60% of patients whose motor function has not improved significantly, indicating that conventional rehabilitation training may have shortcomings. The reasons can be summarized as follows: (1) during the recovery of CVA prognosis, the regular rehabilitation exercise cannot obtain sufficient motor stimulation; (2) the increase in oxidative stress and inflammation caused by aging may affect the effect of muscle strength training; (3) aging factors cause the phenomenon of anabolic impedance.

(p13.1) In a word, in view of the fact that CVA patients generally suffer from muscle fiber shrinkage, reduced muscle starting speed, type II muscle fiber atrophy, fatigue, and reduced number of action units, they often feel muscle weakness during exercise training, which further affects action control, walking speed and endurance, plus the interaction of aging factors. Therefore, when CVA patients receive rehabilitation exercise training, Muscle tissue will bear more physiological pressure, which may lead to the phenomenon that the training effect will not rise but fall. Based on the possible negative effects of sports rehabilitation, it may be necessary to start with a mild and gradual training mode for special groups such as CVA and adjust the degree of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, so they can get a better training adaptation environment first and, then, start to adjust the intensity of sports rehabilitation as to avoid poor adaptation of muscle strength training. At the same time, in addition to effective and highly monitored exercise training intervention, it may still be necessary to integrate other non-drug active intervention methods (nutrition supplement strategy) to help reduce oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory reaction of the system, slow down anabolic impedance reaction, etc., which is extremely important for CVA patients to maintain their daily independent living ability by increasing muscle volume and strength.
