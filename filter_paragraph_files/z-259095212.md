## (s4) Screening and diagnosis
(p4.0) As substance use among older adults continues to rise, effective screening and diagnosis will become increasingly critical. The benefits of early detection and treatment of SUDs can have dramatic implications for overall physical and mental wellbeing in older adults. When examining SUD treatment admissions, patients were mostly referred by an individual (patient or other non-provider) or the criminal justice system. Healthcare providers accounted for only 12.8% of referrals for older adults to substance abuse treatment programs, perhaps suggesting that there is room for improvement in the screening and discussion of SUDs in older adults [6]. While office assessment through history taking might elicit discussion of substance use, this is limited by patient discomfort with reporting stigmatized behavior; however, barriers to more formal screening include lack of time and challenges integrating screening into clinic workflow [7].

(p4.1) While the bulk of screening modalities have been formulated for the general population, there are important considerations regarding their use in older adults. Based on extensive literature review, Kuerbis et al. compiled a comprehensive list of potential indicators of substance misuse and abuse among older adults, organized indicators into four categories: physical symptoms (ex: falls, poor hygiene, poor nutrition, incontinence), cognitive symptoms (ex: disorientation, memory loss), psychiatric symptoms (ex: sleep disturbance, excessive mood swings), and social symptoms (ex: family, financial, or legal problems, social isolation, running out of medication early) [5]. These indicators can be observed in a wide range of medical and psychiatric problems, highlighting the clinical complexity particular to older patients (Table 1).
## (s7) Special considerations in older adults
(p7.0) Compared to their younger counterparts, older adults are more vulnerable to the impacts of alcohol. The etiology is multifactorial, likely related to changes in neurocircuitry, neurovasculature, hepatic function, and adiposity that occur as a function of normal aging [5]. For example, increased permeability of the blood brain barrier, decreased liver metabolism, and increased body fat predispose older adults to alcohol toxicity [16,17]. As adults age, there are changes in body composition that lead to decreased lean muscle mass and decreased total volume of body water available for alcohol to distribute [17,18]. As a result, a given amount of alcohol results in a higher blood alcohol level in older adults and ultimately puts older adults at risk for intoxication and harm at a lower intake of alcohol [16].

(p7.1) Problematic drinking can lead to a host of medical consequences in this population. However, there are different types of problematic drinking, of which binge drinking is the most concerning in older adults. As mentioned before, prevalence of binge drinking has increased in older adults, specifically in males. Binge drinking is associated with injuries and can negatively affect comorbid conditions in older adults by worsening disease and complicating disease management, thus lowering quality of life [19].
## (s8) Treatment
(p8.0) In general, pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatments developed for SUDs in the general population have been shown to be safe and effective in older adults, with psychotherapeutic interventions being of particular use. In the treatment of AUD, naltrexone has consistently been shown to be highly effective for older adults, often superior to its effectiveness in younger populations [28]. On the other hand, disulfiram should generally be avoided in older adults due to its contraindications with cerebrovascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, etc., that are more common in older adults [29]. Aside from pharmacologic treatments, AUD is often treated with interventions such as twelve-step facilitation (TSF); in fact, there is high quality evidence that TSF interventions are more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for increasing abstinence in those with AUD [30].
## (s14) Special considerations in older adults
(p14.0) The adverse effects of cocaine use have been well documented in the general population, and while there are limited data on the adverse effects specifically seen in older adults, the assumption can be made that adverse effects are likely the same or even more devastating in older adults. Cocaine use has been associated with cardiovascular (left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemic heart disease, aortic or cerebrovascular atherosclerosis, arrhythmias, and vasospasm), pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular (stroke, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, aneurysm rupture, and cerebral ischemia), hematologic (prothrombotic properties), and psychiatric complications [1]. A recent study by Soder et al. found that cocaine use disorder could further increase inflammatory burden in older adults [51]. Older adults are likely at an increased risk of adverse effects of cocaine use, and cocaine should be avoided in this population, especially considering that there are no cited medical benefits for cocaine use outside of surgical procedures.

(p14.1) The treatments of choice for cocaine use disorder in older adults are CBT and CM programs, similar to that of the general population [52]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of treatments for cocaine use in the general population found that CM programs were consistently associated with decreased cocaine use, measured with urinalysis, while other treatment options such as psychotherapy, placebo, opioids, psychostimulants, anticonvulsants, dopamine agonists, antidepressants, and antipsychotics were not associated with decreased use [53].
## (s16) Epidemiology
(p16.0) The prevalence of opioid prescriptions in older adults continues to increase [54]. As the population ages, there are increasing indications-whether appropriate or not-for opioids in older adults. Older adults have higher rates of chronic pain, and opioid prescription fill rates were disproportionately higher among adults aged 65 years or older from 2008-2018 [55]. Han et al. found that, among adults 65 years and older, an estimated 1.2% reported past-year prescription opioid misuse in 2015-2016 [56].

(p16.1) The number of adults 55 years and older in the U.S. who entered treatment for opioid use disorder with heroin tripled between 2007 and 2017 [57]. Lynch et al. found that, among adult heroin users 65 years and older, 69% began using heroin before the age of 30 (typical onset) while 31% began using heroin after the age 30 (late onset) [57]. Those with late-onset heroin use were more likely to use heroin more frequently and less likely to receive medication for opioid use disorder or residential treatment [57]. There has also been an increasing death rate among older adults due to opioid overdose [58]. In 1999, the annual death rate due to opioid overdose per 100,000 persons 55 years or older was 0.90 compared to 10.70 in 2019 [58]. The fatality rate was highest among non-Hispanic Black men 55 years or older, with a rate of 40.03 per 100,000 persons [58].
## (s17) Special considerations in older adults
(p17.0) The prescribing of opioids to older adults should be done with caution. Older adults have impairments in drug metabolism and elimination, causing opioids to be more potent and have longer duration of action than predicted in older adults compared to younger adults [59]. In fact, a recent study demonstrated that baby boomers have an increased risk of death from prescription opioid and heroin overdose compared to younger cohorts, suggesting more dramatic consequences of opioid misuse in older adults [60]. In older adults who were prescribed opioids after a medical hospitalization, there was a 7.0% rate of adverse drug events occurring within 30 days of hospital discharge; the most notable risk factors for adverse drug events included dementia, delirium, red flags for opioid misuse, musculoskeletal and nervous system, and prescription of long-acting [61]. Adverse drug events included slowed colonic motility, delirium, nausea/vomiting, fall/fracture, urinary retention, and opioid-related adverse effects [61].
## (s18) Treatment
(p18.0) Opioid use disorder has discrete pharmacologic treatments such as methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Methadone has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of opioid use disorder in older adults [62]. There is less known about the safety of buprenorphine in older adults compared to methadone although it may be preferable because it is less likely to cause withdrawal symptoms, erectile dysfunction, constipation, or respiratory depression [63]. Buprenorphine can also be prescribed by primary care physicians whereas methadone must be administered at qualified opioid treatment centers.
## (s19) Benzodiazepines
(p19.0) Epidemiology Similar to opioid use, benzodiazepine use has also increased in the past few years, with estimates among older adults being as high as 30%, and, between 2003 and 2015, the number of primary care visits associated with prescribing benzodiazepines nearly doubled (3.8% to 7.4%) [64]. Many factors could account for the increased prevalence of benzodiazepine use in older adults, such as overprescription, misdiagnosis, and polypharmacy. Benzodiazepines have been used to treat insomnia, anxiety disorders, and behavioral disturbances in dementia in older adults; the high prevalence of these disorders in older adults makes older adults particularly vulnerable to benzodiazepine misuse [65,66]. A review of studies evaluating the treatment of these diagnoses found inappropriate over-prescribing of benzodiazepines in older adults [67].
## (s20) Special considerations in older adults
(p20.0) Benzodiazepines should be carefully monitored in older adults. Studies have shown conflicting results on whether benzodiazepines are associated with cognitive decline or dementia [68,69], and if so, whether there is a dosedependent response pattern [70]. Conflicting results are likely due to large heterogeneity in demographics across and within different studies. More research must be conducted to clarify the relationship between benzodiazepine use and cognitive function in older adults; although this relationship remains unclear, there are many other well studied reasons to avoid benzodiazepine use in older adults, including sedation, drowsiness, ataxia, and dizziness [71]. In addition to this, long-term benzodiazepine use is well known to be associated with dependence and withdrawal-induced delirium, seizures, and death [72].

(p20.1) Another special consideration in older adults is that past-year misuse of opioids or benzodiazepines in adults 50 years or older has been significantly associated with past-year suicidal ideation, with 25.4% of older adults who misused both opioids and benzodiazepines reporting past-year suicidal ideation compared to only 2.2% of adults not engaged in either medication class misuse [73]. Thus, physicians should screen for suicidality in older adults who are either at-risk for or engaged in misusing opioids and/or benzodiazepines.
## (s21) Treatment
(p21.0) CBT has been shown to aid in discontinuing benzodiazepines; randomized controlled trials showed that the proportion of discontinuing benzodiazepines was significantly higher when patients participated in CBT plus gradual tapering than in gradual tapering alone both in the short and long term [74]. More research should be done to evaluate the efficacy of such therapeutic modalities specifically in older adults.
## (s22) The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
(p22.0) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 13% of Americans reported increasing or starting substance use to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in June 2020 [75]. The existing literature suggests that there was an overall trend towards increased alcohol consumption and a clear trend towards increased use of other substances use in the general population during COVID-19 [76]. While the COVID-19 pandemic has caused psychosocial stressors and economic strain for all adults with SUDs, older adults are disproportionately affected, as they are already at increased risk for social isolation, which can be detrimental when patients rely on interactions with both formal and informal supports to maintain sobriety [77]. To counteract this, there has been a dramatic increase in telehealth availability, particularly in the treatment of SUDs [78]. Studies have shown virtual outpatient care for the treatment of SUD to be a feasible alternative to in-person-only programming [79]. However, access to these virtual programs can be limited by advanced age as older adults might have limited computer literacy, limited access to internet and technology, or hearing loss. Older adults also might prefer inperson visits, as suggested in a qualitative study of older adults in treatment for AUD during COVID-19, where they considered face-to-face provision to be essential [80]. As the popularity of telehealth continues to increase, it will be of utmost importance to address the structural barriers for accessing telehealth treatment for older adults and to adapt such services to increase engagement in older people, their caregivers, and healthcare providers.
## (s24) Barriers to treatment in the older population
(p24.0) Despite increasing rates of substance use in older adults, the number of referrals made by healthcare providers for substance use treatment has been declining [6]. In addition to this, only 18% of substance abuse treatment programs are specifically designed for the geriatric population. Older adults face unique barriers to treatment such as social isolation, limited mobility, financial problems, transportation issues, and shame regarding substance use [5]. Choi et al. found that lack of readiness and cost/limited insurance were the most frequently mentioned barriers to treatment among older adults [85]. The abundance of missed opportunities for screening and treating older adults with substance use problems will have devastating consequences if they are not appropriately addressed moving forward.
