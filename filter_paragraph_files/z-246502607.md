## (s3) Transformational Leadership
(p3.0) Transformational leadership can create something new from something old. According to Avolio & Bruce in Susiawan & Muhid (2015), the practice of transformational leadership style is able to bring about more fundamental changes such as changes in the values, goals, and needs of subordinates. Transformational leadership in the organizational context by Bernard Bass is the ability of leaders to change the work environment, work motivation, and work patterns, and work values perceived by subordinates so that they are better able to optimize performance to achieve organizational goals. Transformational leaders seek to transform visionary into a shared vision so that they (subordinates and leaders) work to make the vision a reality (Adinata, 2015).
