## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is an infection characterized by the accumulation of purulent material in the space between the dura mater and the osseoligamentous confines of the spinal canal [1,2]. It is an unusual disorder, and in a review carried out by Darouiche et al., the prevalence rate varied from 0.18 to 1.96 per 10,000 admissions in hospitals [3]. Despite recent improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of SEA, the mortality rate is still high, ranging from 4.6% to 31% [4].
