## (s1) STXM, µ-XRF and µ-XANES
(p1.0) In scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), monochromatic X-rays are focused on the sample by using an X-rays lens such as a zone plate. An absorption image is generated by raster scanning the sample in the focal plane of the zone plate whilst measuring transmitted X-ray intensity for each point. When the transmitted X-ray photons are collected by a two-dimensional detector, simultaneous differential phase contrast images can be generated, complementing the absorption ones [39][40][41]. An important feature of X-ray microscopy is the possibility to integrate spectroscopic analyses at multiple length scales, till sub-micron or even nanometer range.
