## (s2) Influential Factors of the Healthcare System's Response
(p2.0) MG risks are directly related to the current threats, degree of exposure, and vulnerability of the population and environment [2,60]. Demographics of MG event attendees might influence the degree of potential risk at an MG event, such as age (elderly participants are more vulnerable to health-related risks), participants with a history of comorbidities, and co-existing physiological health conditions such as pregnancy. Influential factors must be taken into consideration while planning for an event, including location, altitude, weather conditions, duration of the event, crowd behavior, the nature of the event (whether it is considered a local or national or international event), staff qualification, level of preparedness, gathering size, population density, amount of health facilities, and concurrent epidemics or pandemics. Equally important is the nature of the event-local, national, or international attendees. Moreover, the risk of communicable infectious diseases rises with increasing population density. Increasing expansion of MG events and the number of people involved would also increase risks, with mobile populations having been shown to produce more emergency service workloads than seated populations [27,[61][62][63].
## (s5) Preparation and Planning for Football MG Events
(p5.0) Inappropriate management of public and environmental health in football MGs threatens the health and welfare of both participants and staff [8]. A 2017 Saudi study presented at the 3rd International Conference on Mass Gatherings Medicine, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia explored the risk, risk mitigation, and health responses at MGs. The event addressed risk assessment at MGs, risk mitigation, and the concept of resilience in the context of MGs. Health services planning and responses, including during emergencies, were further discussed drawing from experiences in various MGs such as the Hajj, sporting events, and music festivals.
## (s6) SALEM Tool: A Mass Gatherings Risk Assessment Framework
(p6.0) It is widely acknowledged that risk assessment is a critical step during the planning for MG events; such an assessment can help in planning and response activities specific to the event. Risk assessment for a MG includes the evaluation of the potential public health impacts, such as the risk of infectious disease outbreak and injury, thereby determining the systems and processes required to successfully and safely deliver the MG event [1]. Several evidence-based tools were developed over recent years and exhibited fair validity and reliability in properly planning MG events [84].
