## (s10) Ordered Measures
(p10.0) Ordered measures can be calculated for inequality dimension with subgroups that have a natural ordering, such as wealth quintiles. They can be grouped into two categories: disproportionality measures, which express inequality as a function of shares of the health indicator compared to shares of the population, and regression-based measures, which make use of an appropriate regression model to estimate the association between the rank of subgroups and the health indicator [10,24].
