## (s4) Cross-Linked UHMWPE Using Gamma Irradiation
(p4.0) Radiation crosslinking in UHMWPE was developed using high-dose radiation to reduce the ductility of the polymer, to increase the hardness and to improve the wear resistance of UHMWPE [27,28].Gamma radiation and electron beam (e-beam) radiation are commonly used as an ionizing radiation source to generate free radicals on the polymer.The recombination of some free radicals form the crosslinks, which reduce the chain stretch of the material, and consequently, the plastic deformation is significantly reduced.The wear resistance is increased with the radiation dose, as can be seen in Figure 2.However, a high radiation dose accelerates the oxidation, which increases the failure of the material [29].This is because excessive free radicals migrate to the interface (crystalline/amorphous) and react with diffused oxygen, causing oxidation and brittleness.The oxidation increases the wear rate, and consequently, the rate of particulate wear of the orthopaedic component [20].Green et al. [30] stated that even though crosslinking can reduce the wear volume, particles released from an irradiated UHMWPE can be more biologically active and smaller than the particles from a non-irradiated one.These small particles increase the probability of osteolysis.
## (s6) Methods of Vitamin E Blending
(p6.0) Vitamin E can be incorporated into UHMWPE using two methods.The first method is diffusing vitamin E into UHMWPE after radiation crosslinking [44,45].This method incorporates vitamin E into UHMWPE using a two-step process.The first step is post-radiation doping with vitamin E, and the second step is a further homogenization into inert atmosphere [44,45].The homogenization step is necessary since it can achieve an adequate antioxidant concentration throughout the implants.Using this method, the crosslinking efficiency of UHMWPE is not limited because vitamin E is not incorporated during irradiation.Furthermore, the amount of incorporated vitamin E is not affected by the crosslink density.Due to the saturation limit of the vitamin E blended UHMWPE at body temperature, the vitamin E concentration is approximately 0.7 wt% [46].However, the UHMWPE has a risk of oxidation during irradiation and in storage until vitamin E is incorporated.The vitamin E-stabilised cross-linked UHMWPE, which is produced using this method, has been clinically used since 2007 [44,45,[47][48][49].

(p6.1) The second method is blending a liquid antioxidant into the UHMWPE resin powder before the mixture consolidates into a near-implant form and radiation crosslinking is performed [39,[50][51][52].This method is easier and takes shorter time to obtain uniform vitamin E concentration throughout the implant compared with the first method [53].However, the presence of vitamin E during the irradiation process reduces the efficiency of UHMWPE crosslinking, because vitamin E itself can act as a free radical scavenger [52].Therefore, the concentration of vitamin E and the radiation dose must be optimized to achieve a good wear and oxidation resistance.The vitamin E concentration in the blend is limited to less than 0.3 wt% [54], and the radiation dose of the commercialized vitamin E-containing acetabular cup is normally less than 100 kGy.

(p6.2) More recently, some studies showed that the mechanical strength and fatigue resistance of vitamin E-stabilised UHMWPE can be further improved by some additional treatments.The further improvement of the wear resistance of vitamin E-stabilised irradiated UHMWPE was achieved by spatially manipulating the vitamin E concentration throughout the implant and limiting cross-linking to the surface [54][55][56].Furthermore, the vitamin E-stabilised UHMWPE showed improved tensile and impact toughness and a good wear and oxidation resistance by high temperature melting after the introduction of vitamin E into UHMWPE [53].
## (s7) Effect of Vitamin E on Tribological and Mechanical Properties of UHMWPE
(p7.0) Compared with conventional UHWMPE, vitamin E-stabilised UHMWPE has the ability to provide an improved tribological property [28].Wear test results indicated that the wear rates of vitamin E-stabilised UHMWPE in clean serum and in serum with third-body particles had a 4-fold to 10-fold decrease from that of conventional UHMWPE [25].The wear behaviour between vitamin E-stabilised UHMWPE and conventional UHMWPE using a knee joint simulator was compared, and the results indicated that vitamin E-stabilised UHMWPE had a consistently lower wear volume than that of the non-treated material [57].It was believed vitamin E addition could prevent delamination caused by oxidation and fatigue, and therefore, significantly influence the life-span of the UHMWPE component.

(p7.1) The mechanical properties of vitamin E-stabilised UHMWPE are affected by vitamin E concentrations.The mechanical properties of vitamin E-stabilised UHMWPE are insensitive to the introduction of vitamin E up to the concentration of 0.4 wt% [51,52].When vitamin E concentration is in a range of 0.01-0.05wt%, vitamin E has a negligible effect on the mechanical properties of unsterilized and gamma sterilized UHMWPE [51].Furthermore, for vitamin E concentration of 0 wt%, 0.1 wt%, 0.2 wt% and 0.4 wt%, the elastic modulus, elongation, tensile, and impact strength have no significant difference for both virgin and gamma sterilized UHMWPE [58].However, for the 0.8 wt% vitamin E stabilised material, the elastic modulus and tensile strength were 20% lower than that of the virgin and gamma sterilized UHMWPE, while the elongation and impact strength remained at the baseline values [58].To sum up, the previous studies [51,52,58] showed that vitamin E alone with up to 0.4 wt% concentration have a marginal effect on the mechanical properties of UHMWPE.However, some studies [44,57,59] suggested that vitamin E-stabilised UHMWPE has a significantly higher tensile strength, yield strength, elongation at break and fatigue resistance, especially at concentrations exceeding 0.1 wt% [59].More detailed information on the mechanical properties of vitamin E-stabilised UHMWPE is shown in Table 2. Further studies on an optimal dose or an optimal dose range and better understanding of the mechanisms of the property improvement are needed.
## (s8) Limitations and Challenges
(p8.0) Although vitamin E is an effective free radical scavenger, it impacts the crosslinking efficiency.Crosslinking radiation dose is an essential factor to the wear resistance.The introduction of vitamin E-stabilised material without any other changes in radiation exposure could result in a lower crosslinking density and has a potential trade off in wear resistance [40].Therefore, it is a challenging work for orthopaedic implant researchers and manufacturers to optimise and determine an appropriate vitamin E concentration and radiation dose to achieve a good wear resistance.
## (s9) Fillers (CNFs, CNTs, Graphene and Hard Particles)
(p9.0) A wide range of fillers are used to enhance the mechanical and lubrication properties of UHMWPE.Table 3 gives an overview of the commonly used filler materials and their effects on the mechanical properties and the wear performance.Details of the filler materials and their existing studies will be presented in the following sub-sections.Owing to the intrinsic properties and cytocompatibility of carbon nanofibres (CNF), incorporation of CNF to improve the mechanical and wear properties of UHMWPE receives increasing attention [61].Studies on the mechanical properties of CNF reinforced polyethylene revealed that the material's yield stress, tensile modulus and hardness increased by the addition of a certain amount of CNFs.For example, it was reported that incorporation of 5 wt% CNFs resulted in an approximately 25% increase in the tensile modulus, while increasing the CNF content to 10 wt% led to a slightly additional benefit [62].Similar trends were also observed for the hardness of CNF reinforced UHMWPE material [62].The addition of the carbon nano-fibres results in an approximately linear increase in hardness.In addition, presence of the nano-fibre in the 10 wt% samples leads to an additional benefit in terms of a further increase in the hardness.The mechanical properties of CNF reinforced polyethylene are sensitive to the CNF concentration.In Sui's work [26], 0.5 wt%, 1.0 wt%, and 3.0 wt% CNF were added into UHMWPE.The tensile strength and tensile modulus of the UHMWPEs increased with the addition of CNFs, while a decrease appeared at 3 wt% content.
## (s10) Graphene
(p10.0) The outstanding mechanical and physical properties of graphene make this material a candidate to be used in UHMWPE composite as a component of AJs.This two-dimensional (2D) material has excellent mechanical properties, such as the Young modulus (0.5-1 Tpa), tensile strength (~130 Gpa) and high thermal and electrical conductivity (~4.84 × 10 3 W/mk and 7600 S/m, respectively) [70,74].These outstanding properties made this material suitable for different applications, including computing, nano and micro-electronical systems, and biomedical fields.

(p10.1) Graphene is produced using different methods.The graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) is obtained by the electrostatic spraying technique.The graphene oxide (GO) is obtained by treating the graphite with a strong oxidazer [71], resulting in a compound of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen.The reduced oxide graphene (RGO) is a result from chemical exfoliation of graphene [75].The properties of graphene are affected by the employed method of acquisition.
## (s12) Limitations and Challenges
(p12.0) The effective use of carbon nanofillers in UHMWPE depends upon its homogeneous dispersion throughout the polymer matrix.Due to the complexity of UHMWPE material, the incorporation of CNF or CNT into UHMWPE is greatly complicated by the extremely high viscosity of the polymer matrix.The agglomerations of carbon nanofillers with a size of several tens of microns could act as localized stress concentration points [62].These weak points could be removed from the bulk material in a wear process, resulting in wear particles.The wear debris could act as a third body between the interfaces and accelerate the material degradation process.

(p12.1) The mechanical properties of hard particles, such as hardness, size and concentration, are essential factors to the wear performance of particle-reinforced UHMWPE.Further study is necessary to determine an optimal particle type, particle size and concentration to minimise or eliminate the side effects of the incorporated particles on the wear performance of UHMWPE material.It is also important to study the interaction of wear debris generated from the particle reinforced UHMWPE with surrounding tissues to evaluate and eliminate possible inflammatory reactions, which may cause osteolysis.

(p12.2) In summary, the key challenges of carbon nanofiller reinforced UHMNWPE for tribological application is the determination of type of carbon nanofiller, the optimisation of carbon nanofiller concentration, and the improvement of blending techniques.Furthermore, knowledge in the public domain about carbon nanofillers reinforced UHMWPE for orthopaedic prostheses remains in its infancy.Additional research is needed to comprehensively study the tribological properties and to warrant its biocompatibility.
## (s16) Photolithography and Nanoimprint Lithography
(p16.0) Photolithgraphy makes surface patterns with a mask.The process involves coating, etching and transferring a photo-resist layer to the surface of a bulk material whose surface properties need to be improved [103].In the study conducted in [107], photolithograpy was used to generate dimples with a diameter of 50 μm, a depth of 15 μm and the area density in a range of 5% to 40% on both stainless steel and UHMWPE surfaces.The study found that having dimples on the UHMWPE surface was more effective for friction reduction than on a stainless steel surface.At high load (700 N), only the patterned UHMWPE surface could effectively reduce friction.

(p16.1) With advances in 3D and nano technology, nanoimprint lithograph (NIL) has become a versatile technique to produce nano-patterns on the surface of UHMWPE.The technique has many attractive features including nano-scale resolution, high throughput, high controllability of 3D nanostructures, low cost, and ability of generating patterns over a large area [100].NIL can generate features with a few nano-metre resolution on either flat or nonflat surfaces.It is used to improve the tribological properties of the surface of UHMWPE.In the study conducted in [108], the patterned UHMWPE surface had a reduction in the friction coefficient between 8% and 35% in comparison to the non-patterned surface when tested under a dry sliding condition and with normal load in a range of 60 to 200 mN.
## (s17) Laser Surface Texturing
(p17.0) Texturing or surface engineering refers to the physical modification of the surface morphology, and is now accepted as an effective and feasible technique for friction reduction and improvement of wear resistance.Due to the interaction of two moving surfaces occurring at various scales from macro to nano scale [109], research on surface texturing at the micro-and nano-metre scale has recently been carried out with the majority of existing studies being in the micron scale.

(p17.1) Commonly used surface texturing techniques for UHMWPE are electrical discharge etching [110] and laser surface engineering [111].Laser micro-machining is now widely used to modify the 3D surface textures of UHMWPE at both micro-and submicro-metre scales.This technique becomes a good alternative to a standard photolithographic process because it is rapid and clean [111].Using experimental and/or simulation methods existing studies investigated the effects of dimple size, depth and area density on the friction and wear properties of UHMWPE and its counterpart.
## (s18) Limitations and Challenges
(p18.0) Possibly due to the capability of current laser technology, only micro-sized dimples were fabricated on UHMWPE surfaces and their effects were investigated in existing studies.Other patterns, such as square, ellipse, need to be fabricated and examined to find an optimal surface texture for friction and wear reduction.Furthermore, nano-scale surface textures were reported to provide low friction and wear properties [108] and need to be studied further.

(p18.1) Modifying surface texture to improve the wear performance and life span of the material is a challenging and debatable topic.Although some encouraging outcomes have been achieved in the past as reviewed above, its long term effect needs further investigations.For example, Kelly et al. [116] evaluated the wear damage of the tibiofemoral articular surface and the mobile-bearing surface (refer to Figure 2A-D of [116]).It was reported that the UHMWPE components became degraded in a relative short time (three years) and the most predominant damages modes were scratching, burnishing and pitting.The scratches, in particular, were believed to be made by a third body wear caused by particles from surgery or particles of the bone cement.Due to the presence of wear debris generated in the wear process and other particles, the wear process and mechanism are often evolved with the surface texture.The initially designed surface morphologies can be modified in the wear process.The long term, practical effect of the surface modification approaches requires further studies.
