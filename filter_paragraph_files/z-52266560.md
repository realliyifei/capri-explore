## (s1) Mathematical background
(p1.0) In this section we review the basic properties of ionospheric electrodynamics, especially at high magnetic latitudes (i.e., the auroral oval).We employ the commonly used thinsheet approximation (see e.g.Glassmeier, 1987;Untiedt and Baumjohann, 1993), where the ionosphere is assumed to be a thin, 2-dimensional spherical shell of radius R I at a constant altitude above the Earth.This approximation is justified by the fact that the largest horizontal currents flow at about 100-125 km altitude, in a layer that is much thinner than the horizontal extents typically considered.However, in some cases 3-dimensional modeling is required (Amm et al., 2008).Another occasionally used approximation is to neglect the curvature of the ionosphere on areas less than ∼1000 km across and to use Cartesian instead of spherical geometry (e.g.Sect.2.1 of Untiedt and Baumjohann, 1993).

(p1.1) The main electrodynamic variables are: horizontal sheet current density J , field-aligned current j , horizontal electric field E, magnetic field B and height integrated Hall and Pedersen conductances H and P .These variables are related through Maxwell's equations, Ohm's law and current continuity,
## (s3) The concept of equivalent current
(p3.0) The ground magnetic data B G is often most conveniently used in the form of an equivalent current.By definition, ionospheric equivalent current J eq,ion is a 2-dimensional, divergence-free sheet current that produces the same ground magnetic field as the real 3-dimensional system consisting of ionospheric currents and FAC.According to potential theory, this kind of equivalent current solution always exists and is uniquely defined in global scale (see discussion in Haines and Torta, 1994).Using field continuation and, if necessary, field separation techniques (see Sect. 3), the ionospheric equivalent current J eq,ion can be derived from measured B G .

(p3.1) In addition to external ionospheric and magnetospheric currents, there are also internal sources of magnetic variations.Changes in external currents create an induced electric field, according to Faraday's law.The induced field drives currents in the ground, depending on the conductivity of the local bedrock.This process of geomagnetic induction distorts the original magnetic signal from external sources, and makes analysis more difficult (e.g.Untiedt and Baumjohann, 1993).The magnetic variations that are caused by the internal induced sources can be separately represented using internal equivalent currents J eq,int , analogous to J eq,ion .

(p3.2) An important question about the ionospheric equivalent currents is their relation to the real currents.The true sheet current density J can be divided into 3 parts, curl-free (potential), divergence-free (rotational) and Laplacian, so that
## (s8) Electric field as the primary output
(p8.0) In Table 1 we have included two methods that give the ionospheric electric field as the primary output.The KRMmethod (named after Kamide, Richmond and Matsushita) was introduced by Kamide et al. (1981) and takes ground magnetic field B G (or equivalent current) and ionospheric conductances as input data.In the 4th method1 the field aligned current j is used instead of B G .

(p8.1) In a sense, also the AMIE-method (Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics, introduced by Richmond and Kamide, 1988) falls into this category, as it gives the ionospheric electric potential as the main output.AMIE is a data assimilation procedure, essentially based on Optimal Interpolation theory (e.g.Matsuo et al., 2005).It assimilates measured electric fields, ionospheric currents, and magnetic field perturbations into a statistical model of the electric potential, assuming that the the ionospheric conductances are given as input data.However, AMIE is not really suitable for mesoscale event studies, as it is designed for global-scale analysis, and relies quite heavily on statistical models of the electric potential and conductances.For further discussion about AMIE and examples of application see e.g.Knipp et al. (1993) or Richmond et al. (1998), and references therein.
## (s12) Conductances as the primary output
(p12.0) A weak point of the techniques discussed in the previous section is that both ionospheric conductances need to be input quantities.Direct conductance measurements are difficult to obtain, and on a mesoscale area with a time resolution of the order of seconds such measurements are unavailable with the present day instrumentation.As discussed before, the use of statistical conductance models, or the estimation of conductances from ground-based or satellite optical data both involve a substantial number of intrinsic approximations.In case of statistical models, smaller scale variations in the actual conductance distribution may not be well represented by the statistical prediction, or it even might not represent the actual conductance distribution very well at all.

(p12.1) For the methods discussed in this section, only the Hall to Pedersen conductance ratio α = H / P is needed as an input parameter, and the individual conductance distributions are the primary output of the techniques.Not only does this remove one degree of freedom from the total amount of assumptions needed (cf.Table 1), but it also has the advantage that α is more accessible for an estimation by ground-based data sets than the individual conductances themselves.This has been shown by Lester et al. (1996), and recently Juusola et al. ( 2007) obtained well-defined statistical relations between α and the magnitude of the zonal component of the ionospheric equivalent currents.
## (s13) 1-dimensional methods
(p13.0) The techniques presented in the previous chapters all operate in two horizontal dimensions.However, several types of situations exist in which data are only available along a single line, and not on a two-dimensional area.Among the most frequent of such situations are data from the pass of a single satellite, or from chains of magnetometers.In such cases, if the analysis of a single event is considered, two-dimensional analysis techniques naturally cannot be applied.Still, several of the 2-D techniques can be reduced to 1-dimensional variants (cf.Table 1) and thus be applied with data along a single line, provided that a horizontal direction exists in which the derivative of the measured data is, to a reasonable approximation, vanishing.This section presents 1-dimensional variants of several of the techniques that were reviewed in the previous section, and also discusses how to validate the 1-D assumption, and how to find an optimal coordinate system for the 1-D approach.

(p13.1) Before a 1-D analysis approach is applied to a data set, it is necessary to verify how well the 1-D assumption is realized in the case under study.While in theory, the term "1-D situation" is unambiguously defined as a situation with vanishing derivative of all measurements in one horizontal direction, in reality such a strict definition is hardly ever realized.For the practical application, the term "1-D situation" therefore refers to an approximation of the theoretical situation, which is defined by certain conditions that the measured data must fulfill.As examples, we discuss these conditions here for two typical cases in which 1-D methods are used: Magnetic field data from the overpass of a single low-orbiting satellite, and a from a magnetometer chain on the ground.Below, the www.ann-geophys.net/29/467/2011/Ann.Geophys., 29, 467-491, 2011 term "null gradient direction" corresponds to the direction in which the derivatives are (approximately) vanishing, and the term "1-D direction" to the direction perpendicular to this.

(p13.2) Using the assumption that the magnetic field disturbance that a low-orbiting satellite measures stems from the ionospheric currents and the FAC only, it is easy to see from an expansion of the current into 1-D SECS (Sect.2.3) that the B r and B θ components of the magnetic field disturbance are not independent of each other for a 1-D situation, since both are solely generated by the J φ current component.(Here the coordinate system (r ,θ ,φ ) refer to the spherical coordinates with respect to the pole of the 1-D SECS.)Juusola et al. (2007) have used this fact to apply the following procedure: For a given pole position of the 1-D SECS systems, the J φ component of the current is computed only from the B r component of the measured magnetic field disturbance.The resulting J φ currents create a B θ ,calc magnetic field disturbance, which in a perfect 1-D situation would be equal to the measured B θ .The magnetic data of an overpass is defined as 1-D if a position of the 1-D SECS pole can be found for which the error between B θ ,calc and B θ is smaller than a certain limit.The position of the 1-D SECS pole for which this error is smallest, which is found by an optimization technique, defines the optimum 1-D coordinate system for that particular overpass.Figure 8 illustrates the error in B θ as a function of the location of the 1-D SECS pole position, and the path how the optimization technique finds the 1-D SECS pole location with the lowest B θ error.

(p13.3) For the magnetic field disturbance data of a ground magnetometer chain, a similar approach is less suitable due to the more significant effect of magnetic field disturbances caused by currents induced into the Earth.Although it is possible to separate the internal and external contributions of the disturbance, the separation approach itself would already need the assumption of a 1-D situation (e.g.Untiedt and Baumjohann, 1993).Therefore, in order to check for a 1-D situation, in this case it is best to analyze data of some magnetometer stations which are aligned perpendicular to the main chain direction, if available.If the direction of the main chain is called u, and the horizontal direction perpendicular to it v, then a line of magnetometer stations in v direction can be used to calculate the derivative of the magnetic field disturbance components in that direction.A good criterion for a 1-D situation is that the changing length l Z of each magnetic field component in v direction is larger than the extent l v of the magnetometer line in v direction, i.e.,
## (s16) 1-D method of characteristics
(p16.0) As already shown by Inhester et al. (1992), in a 1-D case the integral Eqs. ( 44) and ( 45) for the method of characteristics reduce to the simple algebraic relation

(p16.1) where J eq,ion,u is the ionospheric equivalent current in the 1-D direction, as determined with the technique presented in Sect.7.1.As Inhester et al. (1992) pointed out, if there is a location u 0 along the profile where V u = 0, then this sets the unknown constant in Eq. ( 51) to const= −J eq,ion,u (u 0 ).Moreover, the constant is also defined along the whole profile if at one single point of the profile a measurement of the Hall conductance exists.If such a measurement is not available, another suitable approach to estimate the constant is to assume a low background conductance in an area of the profile that is located outside of any electrojet activity, as determined by the ionospheric equivalent currents.
## (s17) 1-D ionospheric currents and FAC determination from low-orbiting satellite magnetic data
(p17.0) Magnetic data of a low-orbiting satellite can be used to determine both ionospheric currents and FAC if the situation can well be approximated as 1-D (see above), by expanding the magnetic disturbance recorded by the satellite into 1-D SECS.Similar to the techniques presented in Sects.3.3 and 7.1, the data is used to calculate optimum scaling factors of the 1-D SECS, which in turn determine both the ionospheric currents and FAC.This approach has first been presented by Juusola et al. (2006), and shown to be superior to previously used techniques to calculate ionospheric currents from satellite data (e.g.Olsen, 1996).One major advantage of using 1-D SECS for this type of analysis is that by placing SECS poles at certain distances, a spatial scale is selected naturally, which is the same for both components of the resulting ionospheric currents and for the FAC.Therefore, it makes sense to combine the results for the different current components for further analysis, even though the magnetic field caused by the FAC is local to the satellite while the one caused by the ionospheric currents is remote.It should be noted that the 1-D SECS technique also makes it possible to analyze low-orbiting satellite and ground-based magnetometer data simultaneously, by combining the techniques of Sect.7.1 and of this section into a single 1-D SECS expansion.This technique has been extensively used with data of the CHAMP satellite (e.g.Ritter et al., 2004), which passes over the auroral ionosphere at about 400 km altitude.Juusola et al. (2007) have analyzed more than 6000 passes between 55 • and 76.5 • northern geomagnetic latitude during 2001 and 2002 which satisfy their 1-D condition.In order to crosscheck the resulting ionospheric currents with results from ground-based magnetometer analysis, the authors selected passes of CHAMP over the MIRACLE network (Fig. 1), and used the technique presented in Sect.3.3 to determine the 2-D ionospheric equivalent currents from the MIRACLE data.They then compared 1-D profiles of these results along each CHAMP overpass with the results of ionospheric currents from the 1-D SECS analysis of the CHAMP data.As can be seen from Fig. 9, the correspondence between the two is very good with a correlation coefficient of 0.9, especially when taking into account that the ground-based technique provides equivalent currents and the satellite-based technique real ones.In practice, the results of Juusola et al. (2007) show that the ground-based and satellite results are interchangeable when the satellite passes over a ground magnetometer array.Juusola et al. (2007) combined the results of all CHAMP passes into a statistical study of the dependence of ionospheric currents and FAC of the general geomagnetic activity level, of season, and of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).As an example, Fig. 10 shows the dependence of J r (FAC), J θ and J φ of the IMF, in addition to the data coverage for each IMF bin, as a function of geomagnetic latitude and MLT.Further, in a 1-D case it is possible to calculate the value of the Hall-to-Pedersen conductance ratio α from the magnetic data alone, simply as
## (s18) Induction in ionospheric electrodynamics
(p18.0) It is usually assumed that inductive phenomena in the ionosphere are negligible.This is a central assumption in many of the analysis methods reviewed in Table 1, because it allows us to present the ionospheric electric field in terms of a potential, as in Eq. ( 30).However, in certain very dynamical situations this assumption is not valid, and the electric field may have a considerable induced rotational part.

(p18.1) Those methods where the electric field is an input parameter (e.g. the method of characteristics) can in principle handle inductive electric fields.However, in practice the input E field is often preprocessed in such a way that the inductive rotational part of the measured field may be lost in the process.For example, the SuperDARN potential mapping technique (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998) is based on the assumption ∇ × E = 0, although recently Amm et al. (2010) presented a technique that allows to pertain the curl when E is calculated from line-of-sight radar data.
## (s25) 3-D modeling and data-analysis
(p25.0) All the methods listed in Table 1 use one common approximation that is not explicitly mentioned in the table: They all assume a thin sheet ionosphere, where all vertical structure is integrated into an infinitely thin layer.This approximation originally stems from the analysis of ground-based magnetometers that alone, due to basic physical reasons (Sect.2.2), can only measure altitude integrated effects.In present day science, it is partly used in order to simplify the analysis, but also because lack of 3-dimensional input data.However, new radar systems such as AMISR (Nicolls and Heinselman, 2007) can already now provide some 3-D measurements, and the amount of available data will increase in the near future with upcoming missions like the Swarm ionospheric multisatellite project, or the EISCAT 3-D radar system.Consequently, also data-analysis methods have to be formulated in 3-D, so that the new observations can be fully utilized.This line of future development has been discussed by Amm et al. (2008) in a recent review article.
## (s26) Summary
(p26.0) We have reviewed selected data-analysis methods suitable to be used with data from a mesoscale ionospheric observation network (some hundred or a few thousand km across), such as MIRACLE illustrated in Fig. 1, possibly in combination with satellite measurements.Table 1 gives an overview of the reviewed methods, including input and output data as well as assumption used in the method (if any).

(p26.1) As discussed in Sect.2, we need 3 separate (scalar) input parameters in order to solve the full electrodynamic state of the ionosphere.In some cases a smaller number may be sufficient for a partial solution, like in the elementary sys-tem method, where ground magnetic field and FAC are used to determine the horizontal current system, but the electric field remains unknown unless conductance data are available.Looking at Table 1, and including the extensions of the method of characteristics as discussed in Sect.9.1, it would appear that an analysis method has been developed for most, if not all of those input data sets that allow for a full solution.However, there may be several undeveloped methods that give a partial, but still useful solution of ionospheric electrodynamics.

(p26.2) Several methods listed in Table 1 use ground magnetic measurements as the input data.Typically B G is first converted to ionospheric equivalent current, as discussed in Sect.3. In principle the ground magnetic disturbance should be separated into internal and external parts, but in practice performing the separation with a too sparse magnetometer array may cause larger errors than simply neglecting the often small and fairly uniform internal part (Pulkkinen et al., 2003b).
