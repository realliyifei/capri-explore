## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Due to escalating demand, the prevalent usage of natural coarse and fine aggregate in concrete production is facing depletion.Alleviating the strain on this crucial resource and ensuring its preservation have become imperative.The construction industry necessitates sustainable alternatives to natural aggregates [1,2].Kasyar et al. [3] conducted an investigation into the utilization of waste crumb rubber to replace natural aggregates in Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC).Waste materials are employed to modify the mechanical and durability properties of SCC, adapting it for diverse applications.The adoption of lightweight materials, like crumb rubber concrete, simplifies the use of SCC in tall building construction and facilitates ease of pumping to greater construction heights.These outcomes not only lead to cost reduction and energy savings but also promote ecological equilibrium and conserve natural resources [4].The sources of these natural resources encompass agricultural, industrial, and municipal waste, as illustrated in Figure 1.
## (s6) Impact of CCW on concrete setting time
(p6.0) Gora et al. [55] found that CCW replacement decreased concrete's initial and final setting time and was mainly reduced at 5% replacement, indicating that early strength gain was initiated due to CCW addition to the concrete mix.Morla et al. [56] observed that the geopolymer paste with the lowest CCW level exhibited a lower initial and final setting time.The results from the comprehensive strength of Geopolymer Concrete (GPC) and Regular Portland Concrete (OPC) on the 7th and 28th days are shown in Figure 3. Barreto et al. [57] researched concrete properties at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20% replacement of OPC with CCW after 28 days of curing, showing that both the initial and final setting time decreased with CCW.Results of the 0 alongside 20% formulations' SEM fractographic analysis are shown in Figure 4.The existence of C-S-H, illogical and CH crystals was confirmed in subgraphs (a) and (b) of Figure 4, corresponding to the reference concrete.Figures 4c and 4d show that the existence of CH was not confirmed, indicating that the CH content in this C20% concrete had decreased.This early strength development was attributed to the vast CaO content of CCW in reaction with water.

(p6.1) Manasseh [49] examined the properties of RHA and CCW on concrete, the author varied RHA from 0 to 30% at 10% intervals, and CCW from 0 to 40% varied at 10% level observed a decrease in the setting time of concrete at 10% CCW replacement but increased above 10% CCW for all samples.This the studyImages attributed to low heat liberation due to reactivity loss associated with CCW compared to cement.According to Abdurra'uf et al. [50], the mortar's initial and final setting time increased with CCW to investigate the properties of calcium carbide-modified mortar.[42] to partially replace cement with CCW, the compressive strength decreased as the replacement level increased.However, the 5% replacement CCW presented an exception.The strength value (25.26 N/mm2) increased over the conventional concrete (23.26 N/mm2) before decreasing the other higher replacement levels.Optimum compressive strength is achieved at a 5% replacement level.Makaratat et al. [58] mixed CCW with fly ash for cement substitution and obtained an excellent compressive strength rating of 28.4 N/mm2 in a report of a similar nature.They concluded that, except for masonry construction, substituting cement with over ten per cent CCW will not provide the necessary strength for durable concrete carrying a significant load.

(p6.2) Hassan et al. [59] used a proportion of water to the cement of 0.4 to assess the fresh and toughened characteristics of a self-compacted cement comprising CCW and sorghum peeling ash (SHA) in the proportions of 30:70 and 1.5-3.75%,respectively, as binders.They found that the Mortar met the ASTM C270 type N requirements and had a maximum compressive strength of 14.08 MPa [60].According to Lotfy [61] research, compressive strength is adequate for concrete at 10% cement replacement.However, with over 10% cement replacement, the condition becomes unsatisfactory after 14 and 28 days of curing.Gora et al. [55] examined the impact of CCW (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5%) on the compressive strength of Mortar at ages 7, 28, and 56 days after relieving.The CCW mortar's compressive strength increased by 8% at 2% concrete replacement after 56 days of relieving age, representing the most improvement above the control case.Portland cement and CCW underwent secondary soaking in this manner.The Ugwu et al. [62] study examined Self-Compacting Concrete's flow and mechanical characteristics containing quarry dust, calcium carbide, and pulverised fuel ash.At intervals of 5%, the cement content was replaced by 5-20%.The anticipated increase in compressive strength was attained at 15% of quarry dust and pulverised fuel ash and 20% cement replacement with pulverised fuel ash but declined at 20% CCW.According to Liang et al. [63], as the percentage of CCW in the paste decreases, so does the compressive strength of geopolymer paste.Therefore, using CCW as a filler geopolymer paste is advised.

(p6.3) A comparative study conducted by Tuleun and Jimoh [47] to evaluate the performance of concrete at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20% substitution of OPC with CCW reveals a maximum improvement in compressive strength of 19.9% at 5% replacement.Additionally, they saw that the compressive strength reduced after 5% and then increased as the curing age grew.The features of Self-Compacting Concrete using rice husk ash (RHA) and calcium carbide waste (CCW) were studied.10% RHA was added to the cement content as an additive, and 0-20% CCW was substituted for cement at intervals of 5%.Also, the author discovered a slightly different trend; the author observed 10% RHA and 10% CCW peak compressive strength values of 35Mpa and 39.53 Mpa, similar to the compressive strength values of 37.11N/ and 40N.However, the conventional concrete at 28 and 56 days reduced after that beyond 10%.
## (s8) Impact of CCW on the concrete flexural strength
(p8.0) The excellent engineering and physical qualities of calcium carbonate whisker (CCW) and its affordable price and straightforward manufacturing method have made it a widely used material.In this research, Xing et al. [65] created modified asphalt by mixing CCW with the asphalt binder.Using various experimental techniques, the morphological features, thermal performance, and rheological qualities of CCW and the modified asphalts were investigated.The surface of CCW was treated with the silane coupling agent (2 wt%, KH-570) to improve the compatibility of bitumen and CCW.
## (s12) Passing ability
(p12.0) The ability of new material to pass through barred openings, such as scattered steel reinforcing bars, without halting up or isolating itself is known as passing skill.According to the European Rules from 2005, the "L-Box" and the "J-Ring" tests should be used to determine the Self-Compacting Concrete's passing skill.Instead of macroaggregates by volume, Bignozzi et al. [84] used 0, 22.2, and 33.3% pulverised elastic powder (0.05-0.7 mm), and 22.2% of the powdered elastic affected the j-ring test values.However, adding 33.3% granulated rubber increased the ring test value.Amran et al. [85] tested clam rubber SCC samples (up to 2 mm) with different volume substitution rates of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% sand.The L box test verifies the passing ability.They concluded that adding 40% rubber content to the SCC reduced the passing ability of the SCC by 13.1% compared to that of the SCC without rubber content.Rahman et al. [90] investigated rubber-modified Self-Compacting Concrete's basic properties with different rubber contents.The L-box test results concluded that the rubber-modified SCC had a considerably lower passing ability ratio (0.28 to 0.4) than the average SCC and that increasing the super-plasticizer did not improve the passing ability.The study replaced the sand with 15% and 20% shredded rubber and a volume fraction of steel fibres.Based on their L-box test data, it is clear that there is no significant difference in the passing ability of conventional SCC and rubberised SCC containing viscosity modifiers.
## (s23) Mix design approach by the European guidelines for SCC
(p23.0) Laboratory studies are necessary for this design strategy to confirm that the initial mixed composition's characteristics match the desired characteristics and classifications.The blended composition should be modified as needed [113].The mix should be tested at full scale in a concrete factory and, if required, on-site to guarantee fresh and hardened qualities after all requirements have been met.The methodology outlined here serves as the foundation for mixed design.
## (s24) Mix design according to BS EN 206:2013
(p24.0) While planning a blend, it is more helpful to consider the general extent of critical parts by volume instead of mass.More changes are expected to meet strength and other execution prerequisites [114].Below is the typical range of ratios and quantities to obtain self-compaction.
## (s26) COMPOSITION OF RUBBER TIRE AND CLASSIFICATION OF RUBBER AGGREGATES
(p26.0) Flexible/elastomers, Carbon gloomy, Metal, Material, Zinc Oxide, Sulfur, Added Substances, and Carbon-based Substances are only a few materials used to make elastic tires.Rubber aggregate can be obtained in many forms and sizes, as shown in Figure 6  Kelechi et al. [122] In this work, the durability characteristics of SCC with CR changed with fly ash and CCW are examined.Water absorption, acid attack, salt resistance, and increased mix temperatures are considered while determining durability.The mixtures with no-fly ash content and their replica mixtures with fly ash replacing 40% of the cement were used in the experiment.In the mixes, CCW was used as a partial substitute for cement at 0%, 5%, and 10% by volume, and CR was used to partially replace fine aggregate in proportions of 0%, 10%, and 20% by volume.The findings show that mixes with fly ash exhibited stronger resistance to salt (MgSO4) and acid (H2SO4), with up to 23% more resistance than mixes without fly ash, as shown in subgraphs (a) and (b) of Figure 7.The application of CCW increases the temperature rise, higher internal stresses, oxidation of exposed reinforcement, reduced ability to withstand freeze/thaw, and an upsurge in the sulfuric acid attack.And a rise in the rate of drying shrinkage from 10 to 50 % can all be a consequence of the characteristics of self-compacting rubber-concrete [123].Also, Poor-quality fly ash can make the concrete more susceptible to water and harm the structure.The outcome revealed that the weight of substantial volume dropped by 3% for every 10% addition of crumb rubber.With more crumb rubber quantity, the strength in compression and splitting also diminished.The disadvantages of the waste materials produced by expired tires, excess CCW and fly ash in the environment can further damage and affects the cultivable lands, contaminate water, courses air pollution, affect the waste management system, endanger lives and properties whereby cause a dearth of useful land, as presented in Figure 8.Therefore, these disadvantages can be appropriately managed to obtain the benefit of utilising natural properties.Implementing it will guarantee that all of this industrial waste is consumed.Including calcium carbide waste changed the consistency of cement paste while reducing drying shrinkage and setting times [124].It might be employed as an accelerator.The workability of concrete was also somewhat improved by CCW addition.The compressive strength of concrete was enhanced by adding up to 0.5% CCW.Applying the polyvinyl acetate enhancer increased compressive strength from 11 to 17% for various crumb rubber materials, with the 30% crumb rubber substitution yielding a maximum strength improvement of 17% [125].Crumb rubber concrete has outstanding freeze-thaw features.Currently, the development of Self-Compacting Concrete involves substituting up to 50% of the cement with high-volume fly ash.A good slump flow of the SCC is made feasible by the considerable amount of fly ash. Figure 9 depicts the overview of the implementation of these waste materials in developing SCC.
