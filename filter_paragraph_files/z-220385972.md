## (s0) The Environmental Resistome
(p0.0) The environmental resistome provides a clear understanding of the origins of antibiotic resistance. Compiling evidence has shown that the environment is at the same time the source and the reservoir for resistant genes [23][24][25]. The genetic and functional diversity in the resistome is the reflection of the evolutionary process of billions of years of bacterial co-existence with organic and inorganic compounds [25]. Resistant determinants found in environmental bacteria are genetically and mechanistically diverse [25,26]. These elements were long encoded in the bacteria genomes and has evolved in response to their exposure to organic and inorganic toxic substances [25] It is the continuous attempt to indiscriminately sterilize the environment through the use of antimicrobials agents, heavy metals and disinfectants [27,28] that has mainly contributed to the disruption of the ecosystem. The selective pressure and mobilization of resistance elements has led to the emergence 
## (s16) Rapid Diagnostic Tests
(p16.0) Today, antibiotics are prescribed either empirically or "just in case." They are very rarely based on definitive diagnosis because the laboratory tests still rely on the processes developed in the 1860s. The lapse of time exceeding 36 h fosters diagnostic uncertainty and leads to over-prescribing of antibiotics to eliminate risk perceptions. Promoting new rapid diagnostic tests can be considered critical for a drastic shift in the practice [57,73,178] and a substantial decrease in unnecessary prescribing. However, it may not represent an incentive to pharmaceutical companies to invest in R&D especially generic companies because of the financial implication on sales may be huge. In LMICs, where affordability and easy access to diagnostics are the main barriers, using a Diagnostic Market Stimulus (DMS) is estimated at an average yearly cost of US $0.5 to $1 billion based on the cost of current available diagnostic tests. Recent developments include the access to and use of biomarkers, such as procalcitonin, to reduce antibiotic duration and for early cessation of therapy [178].
