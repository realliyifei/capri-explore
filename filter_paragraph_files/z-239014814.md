## (s5) Frugality Discourse Post 1970: Re-Imagination and Application of the Concept of Frugality
(p5.0) Post 1970 the world economy again saw a downturn in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.The oil prices were rising, and an economic crisis was looming large.Under these circumstances frugality came to be debated again and publications started reappearing.Alongside, a movement for appropriate technology was on the rise following Schumacher's legacy of the 'small is beautiful' -today considered to be one of the origins of the current thoughts on 'frugal innovation'. [48,66] central point of the discourse was the ecological and environmental concerns, underlining the impending threats of resource depletion.In this era frugal and frugality received enough emphases to eventually find a place in the first ever National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-282) of the United States of America.This policy emphasized on the frugal use of resources as one for developing future technologies and emphasized on policies encouraging "the use of science and technology to foster frugal use of materials, energy, and appropriated funds".The relevance of frugality in technology and innovation discourse thus makes its first appearance.
