## (s3) Methods
(p3.0) The following criteria were used in the review: (1) studies written in English and published in international peer-reviewed journals between 1990 and 2008, (2) harm reduction intervention studies among drug users in mainland China and (3) related government policies on illicit drug abuse and HIV intervention programs.

(p3.1) Relevant intervention studies were obtained using the following databases: Pubmed, Medline, EBSCO and Google Scholar. The combinations of key words used to identify relevant articles included: China, HIV, AIDS, drug use, narcotic control, incarceration, voluntary counseling and testing and harm reduction intervention.
## (s6) Results of harm reduction interventions and HIV prevention among drug users in China
(p6.0) The results of the empirical studies [5,[35][36][37][38][39][40][41] in China revealed that most of the interventions on harm reduction (e.g. MMT and NEP) and HIV prevention (e.g. VCT) were successful and had positive effects in reducing drug related risk behaviors among drug users in both institution-based and community-based programs. For example, two MMT intervention studies showed that the use of MMT decreased the frequency of IDU and criminal behaviors [37]. Three needle related studies revealed a significant reduction of needle-sharing among drug users [40,41] and a decline of new drug injectors in the follow-survey [39]. Results of VCT studies documented that participants increased their HIV/AIDS knowledge [35], increased condom use with regular and casual sex partners, and decreased needle-sharing [36]. Two HIV knowledge-oriented studies have shown that participants, after receiving the intervention, increased their HIV-related knowledge, their understanding of HIV prevention methods, and indicated positive attitudes toward those with HIV/AIDS [38,42]. These positive results are consistent with the large body of empirical evidence on effectiveness of harm reduction programs in other countries [43][44][45][46][47][48][49].
## (s7) Discussion
(p7.0) China has made substantial progress in the development and implementation of policies on the management of drug use and on effective intervention strategies for HIV/AIDS in the past few years [27]. The newly-enacted Narcotic Control Law is a milestone in harm reduction and HIV prevention initiative. With the hierarchical authority system in China, the new law would be quickly enacted at different administration levels, ushering in a new era of drug management and HIV intervention in both community level and incarceration sites in the world's most populous nation.
## (s8) Conclusions
(p8.0) The Chinese government has made significant progress in evolving the policy on drug abuse. Policies on harm reduction and HIV intervention have been improved and enhanced based on the findings from research and practices. This review demonstrates that harm reduction programs have been successfully implemented in most cases and yielded positive effects in reducing drug related risk behaviors among drug users in China. This evidence serves as an important resource for advocating the further development of harm reduction programs among this population. Despite the fact that there remain challenges, China is increasingly adopting scientific evidence-based approaches and has encouraged the pilot testing of methods of risk reduction [27]. This increasing use of scientifically validated evidence together with supportive policy on harm reduction programs, demonstrates not only the Chinese government's continuing commitment and determination in the fight against HIV, but also the importance of future intervention research in China.
