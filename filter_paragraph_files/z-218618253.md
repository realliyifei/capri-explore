## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Periodontal diseases are infectious diseases characterized by progressive destruction of the periodontium (tooth-supporting tissue), which includes the periodontal ligament (PDL), cementum, alveolar bone, and gingiva [1] . Tooth loss mainly results from periodontal diseases in adults, which adds a substantial burden to public health worldwide [2,3] . Periodontal treatment is not as easy as only controlling inflammation and preventing disease development; the reconstruction of a healthy periodontium destroyed by diseases deserves equal attention [4,5] . Current therapies for periodontal diseases in the clinic, including conservative approaches, radicular conditioning, bioactive bone grafting/substitution, and guided tissue regeneration (GTR), encounter difficulty in regenerating the periodontium completely [6] . Therefore, the stem cell-based tissue regeneration approach involving transplantation of stem cells to enhance periodontal tissue regeneration has gradually taken the place of guided bone/tissue regeneration [7][8][9] .
