## (s8) 
(p8.0) With calculated mean and variance, many methods have been developed to derive route TTDs including Central Limit Theorem, cupula, convolution, Markov chain, etc., to be reviewed in detail in Section 6.2. Taking the Central Limit Theorem as an example, the route travel time would follow a Normal distribution regardless of the link TTDs (e.g., Lo and Tung, 2003;Lo et al., 2006;Shao et al., 2006aShao et al., , 2006b. Consequently, the route TTD can be expressed as

## (s10) Capturing the heterogeneous TTDs based on different modeling rationales
(p10.0) As verified by Plötz et al. (2017) and Zang et al. (2018a), the performance of the same TTD model in fitting different travel time datasets may be different. Consequently, many different TTD models, based on different modeling rationales, have been developed to fit heterogeneous TTDs. As can be seen from Table 1, the TTD models based on single distribution and mixture modeling rationales have been widely studied for decades. In particular, the single distribution model is suitable for fitting a TTD with a typical right-skewed distribution and a long/fat tail,

(p10.1) whereas the mixture distribution model can deal with the multimodality that arises from interrupted flow at intersections or congested traffic conditions in the urban transportation systems. Although relatively less attention has been paid to TTD models based on the momentbased modeling rationale, the performance of TTD models based on this modeling rationale are promising because they do not need assumptions about the distribution of travel time and can adaptively fit heterogeneous TTDs using the actual travel time data. The fourth set of methods to derive TTD models, based on the source-based derivation modeling rationale, is mainly used in network-wide theoretical studies.

## (s18) (4) Statistical methods: distribution tail
(p18.0) Empirical studies (Odgaard et al., 2005;van Lint et al., 2008;Franklin and Karlström, 2009;Sikka and Hanley, 2013) show that the unexpected delays resulting from the distribution tail of travel time can lead to serious consequences. Tail-based reliability measures have been developed to consider the effects of distribution tails in TTR evaluation. Tail-based measures are also referred to as tardy trip indicators, and are used to answer the question "How often will a traveler be unacceptably late?" The key for these measures is modeling the distribution tail, which has the following general formula:

## (s21) Obtaining the characterized TTDs and then developing reliability measures
(p21.0) We briefly review how to obtain the characterized TTDs based on an assumed distribution of uncertainty from the supply side (Lo and Tung, 2003;Lo et al., 2006), the demand side (Shao et al., 2006a(Shao et al., , 2006b, and both the demand and supply sides .

## (s23) Directly developing reliability measures
(p23.0) Game theory is a representative methodology for directly developing reliability measures based on assumed sources of uncertainty. The source of uncertainty in game theory is the stochastic traffic supplies that are the result of link failures. In particular, compared to the route choice criterion used in traditional user equilibrium or stochastic user equilibrium, the route choice criterion in game theory assumes that the demons select links that will cause the maximum damage to travelers, while travelers accordingly seek the best routes to avoid link failures (e.g., Bell, 2000;Bell and Cassir, 2002;Szeto et al., 2006;Szeto, 2011). The resulting trip cost obtained by the game theory model is used as the measure to evaluate the network performance reliability. Please refer to Section 5.2.1 for the general formula of game theory model.

## (s31) Dimensions of Valuing Travel Time Reliability
(p31.0) Based on the well-established schedule delay model, Bates et al. (2001) develops a general model of the VOR for personal travel, which brought on huge empirical and theoretical studies of the VOR. Building on this work, Fosgerau and Karlström (2010) derives the simple expression of the optimal expected utility shown in Eq. (33), providing a foundation for subsequent VOR research. In addition to the standard dimension of VOR (e.g., Bates et al., 2001;Fosgerau and Karlström, 2010;Fosgerau and Engelson, 2011), there are a variety of dimensions of VOR. Below, we briefly introduce these valuation dimensions.

Other Issues:
- The content heavily relies on references to other studies without providing a clear summary or explanation of the actual valuation dimensions of VOR. Additional explanation or a more detailed summary of the dimensions would be needed for it to be a good answer in a question answering dataset.

## (s35) TRAVEL TIME RELIABILITY-BASED TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT
(p35.0) This section summarizes the methodologies for modeling traffic assignment with consideration of TTR, which will be referred to as TTR-based assignment for short. The general framework of TTR-based assignment is presented in Figure 7. Before introducing how to capture travelers' attitudes to TTR in the route choice criterion, it is worthwhile to point out that in the TTR-based traffic assignment, the route choice criterion is used to determine the optimal reliable path for loading the travel demand onto the network.

(p35.1) The procedure of determining the optimal reliable path corresponds to the reliable path finding problem in the literature, which is an active research problem conducted by many researchers from different aspects. For example, Miller-Hooks and her colleagues propose several efficient procedures for finding the reliable paths with the least expected time as reliability measure in stochastic and time-varying networks (Miller-Hooks and Mahmassani, 1998, 2000Miller-Hooks, 2001;Opasanon and Miller-Hooks, 2006). Shahabi et al. (2013Shahabi et al. ( , 2015 discuss the robustness of the reliable path finding problem and design solution algorithms for this problem.

## (s37) Dimension 1: objective quantification of travel time reliability
(p37.0) To account for TTR in traffic assignment, various risk or utility measures are used to capture the role of travelers' attitudes toward TTR in route choice criterion. Table 6 summarizes the representative types and the corresponding measure. The first type is based on utility and mainly consists of expected utility-based and non-expected utility-based measures. Expected utility-based measures assume that decision-making under uncertainty aims to maximize the expected utility, e.g., mean-variance (Jackson and Jucker, 1982), late arrival penalty (Watling, 2006), quadratic utility function (Mirchandani and Soroush, 1987), and exponential utility function (Tatineni et al., 1997;Chen et al., 2002a). In the above utility measures, travelers' different risk attitudes toward TTR can be determined with different parameters. In contrast, the non-expected utility-based measures are based on the idea that decision-making under uncertainty may not be made according to the expected utility maximization, as demonstrated in the cumulative prospect theory (e.g., Avineri, 2006;Connors and Sumalee, 2009;Xu et al., 2011), regret theory (Chorus, 2012;Li and Huang, 2017), and fuzzy set theory (Miralinaghi et al., 2016). Cumulative prospect theory assumes that travelers compare a summary statistic of the perceived utility (instead of the expected utility) of each route before choosing one. Regret theory uses the modified utility function to calculate route utility and assumes that a traveler can anticipate the possibility that the chosen route may be slower or faster than a non-chosen route, causing regret or satisfaction, respectively. Finally, fuzzy set theory uses the membership value function to calculate route utility, where the mode of the random travel time of each link has the highest membership value and, accordingly, the highest route utility.

## (s51) Uncertainty Propagation from Source to Link TTD
(p51.0) In early studies on TTR-based traffic assignment, TTD is assumed to be exogenous (i.e., provided explicitly) and flow-independent. Thus, these studies do not make any assumptions about the source and there is no propagation consideration of uncertainty (Mirchandani and Soroush, 1987;Uchida and Iida, 1993). Recent studies on TTR-based traffic assignment assume that TTDs are flow-dependent and that travel time variability originates from the uncertainty in certain sources, such as the supply side (Lo and Tung, 2003;Lo et al., 2006), the demand side (Shao et al., 2006a(Shao et al., , 2006b, or both . Figure 9 summarizes the three common paradigms for understanding the uncertainty propagation processes in TTRbased traffic assignment problems.

(p51.1) • In Paradigm 1, supply side uncertainty is the sole uncertainty source and includes two cases: link capacity variation (Lo and Tung 2003;Lo et al., 2006) and free-flow travel time variation (Chen et al., 2010). Under this paradigm, the uncertainty would directly propagate from the source to the link travel time through a link cost function.

LLM judge: YES

## (s60) 2) Considering the correlations between link TTDs with TTD assumptions
(p60.0) To alleviate the loss of accuracy caused by neglecting the correlations between link TTDs, some researchers concentrate on modeling the correlations in TTD aggregation with assumed distribution type of link travel time.

(p60.1) Lognormal distribution is a typically assumed distribution type for link TTD for capturing the correlations between link TTDs. Then, the Fenton-Wilkinson approximation is used for obtaining route TTD (Srinivasan et al., 2014;Chen et al., 2018). This approximation method is first proposed by Fenton (1960)  Lognormal (i.e., shifted Lognormal) distributions (Srinivasan et al., 2014). This new shift parameter of route TTD can also be expressed by the shift parameters of the link TTDs.
