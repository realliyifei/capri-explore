## (s3) Proximate Comparisons of Camel Milk with Other Species
(p3.0) Camel milk is unlike other ruminants milk, with low cholesterol, low sugar, high minerals, (sodium, potassium, iron, zinc, and magnesium), high vitamin C, low protein, and a large concentration of insulin [18]. Furthermore, the milk composition of the dromedary camel is great from a dietary perspective. Different authors are argued that composition of camel milk varies due to difference of geographical origin and year of publication of the published data's but other factors such as the physiological stage, feeding conditions, seasonal or physiological variations, genetic or health status of the camel have also paramount importance [19]. The most minimal substance of fat was recorded in the fifth month of lactation, which compared with the lactation top [20]. According to [21], It is likewise found that the normal fat% and SNF% between two age bunch are 3.35±0.07 and 4.37±0.70, 8.34±0.24 and 9.17±0.49, individually and the distinctions were found exceptionally critical. Camel milk is made out of lactose, fat, and protein is generally a similar extent as cow milk [6].
## (s4) Health Benefits and Curative Properties of Camel Milk
(p4.0) Camel milk likewise has vital curative properties as it contains a high degree of antibacterial substances and a higher immune defense mechanism in correlation with cow milk [14]. It contains approximately 52 units of insulin in each liter of camel milk, making it a great treatment option for Type 1 or Type 2 diabetics as well as Gestational Diabetes [16]. The number of scholars has been argued that one of the unique characteristics of camel milk such as its therapeutic potential and absence β-LG has made it a focus area of research in the fields of health science and nutrition as an antimicrobial, anti-diabetic and antihypertensive supplement [6].
## (s5) Probiotic Property and Nutritive Value
(p5.0) Camel milk is a significant segment of the human diet routine in numerous parts of the world [14]. Whereas the commitments rendered by dromedary camels are milk production and transportation [24]. However, the contribution of camel milk to family unit nourishment admission is critical during the dry season [16]. The camel milk is a profoundly nutritious item giving a perfect situation to the development of various and complex microbial populations. These bacterial populaces are principally gathered into two significant classifications: (i) advantageous and innovatively pertinent microscopic organisms and (ii) pathogenic and waste microorganisms. Nowadays, a couple of studies depend on the way of life subordinate methodologies have been led on the recognizable proof of the bacterial populaces of camel milk [15,25].
## (s6) The Role Camel Milk for Domestic Food Diet
(p6.0) Camel milk is an imperative part of food consumption routine for families in a domain that might be correct named as unfavorable as far as temperature, and its contribution to a solid healthful status, particularly during the dry spell where others domestic dairy animals ceased production and absence of field, is without a reservation [2]. The extent of families  [15,26]. The camel milk is directly consumed about 60.9% while remained is used for selling and calve feeding.
