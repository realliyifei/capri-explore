## (s5) Using a variety of coping strategies to improve MTB
(p5.0) According to this literature review, there is a strong need for effective support strategies for female breast cancer survivors to improve MTB and help survivors with poor MTB overcome various barriers to AET use.This requires not only medication self-administration strategies, but also a supportive social network to help and support their continued use of AET.The following are specific interventions:

(p5.1) At first, when prescribing AET, survivors need comprehensive information about the side-effects associated with the prescribed medication and the likelihood of these side-effects occurring.For example, joint pain may arise with the use of AET and could prevent them from doing housework, driving, cooking, etc.One survivor described the benefits of knowing the side-effects, which allowed her to organize her day more rationally. [18]Strategies to deal with side-effects are available through formal resources (e.g., brochures, online resources, components of group education sessions) or reach out to through tumor survival programs, primary care providers, and peer support groups.Interventions such as exercise plans, [24] hypnosis, yoga, and relaxation strategies may help women better cope with long-term AET use.
## (s6) Methodology critique
(p6.0) As we all know, when planning a study, researchers must consider the philosophical worldview assumptions that they bring to the study, the strategy of inquiry related to this worldview, and the specific methods or procedures of research that translate the approach into practice. [26]Regarding the experience of AET in female breast cancer survivors, the worldviews included post-positivism, positivism, and interpretivism in 15 studies.Positivism is considered a scientific method based on rationalism, only when researchers systematically and dispassionately observe the data of the empirical world can researchers discover legitimate patterns with evidence, for example, Wickersham, Happ and Bender [7] and Hurtado-de-Mendoza et al [9] Postpositivism reflects the need to identify and assess the causes of impact from research questions and allows for complexity and personalization of patient care, builds on knowledge as evidence-based practices change, and helps develop usable and transferable knowledge for those providing care, [27] like Graetz et al [25] and Paulo et al [24] The individual perception of social reality in the process of interaction between consciousness and object, according to Interpretivism, was socially constructed, for instance, Lambert et al [22] Fifteen studies (eleven qualitative and 4 quantitative) were included in this review.On the one hand, 4 quantitative studies included different designs.Paulo et al [24] used a randomized controlled trial study.Through simple random sampling, control and intervention groups were identified, providing exercise plan intervention for female breast cancer survivors.While this approach was better at preventing the effects of human factors and validating the findings, the study lacked physical function tests, small sample sizes, and self-reported assessments of questionnaires that were often inferior to objective measurements.Moon et al [15] used a longitudinal study which was also known as follow-up study and observed the dynamics of the variables over a 1-year follow-up period, showing the chronological order between the independent and dependent variables.Its results were more convincing than the results of the cross-section study, but the racial differences in the study sample were small.Liu et al [14] used an observational study that assessed the effect of doctor-patient communication on adherence 3 years after diagnosis by non-randomizing comparisons of specific low-income breast cancer women who used initiated AET.However, the study sample did not represent more racial differences and measured results by patient selfreporting, so the reported high adherence rate may be affected by bias in social expectation responses.Graetz et al [25] used a randomized controlled feasibility trial, since it was a small pilot trial, statistically, significant differences in the findings could not be detected, and the samples came from a single clinic, which limited the generalizability of the results.Nevertheless, using this approach, the necessary revisions and refinements of the intervention programme can be made based on the results of the study.
