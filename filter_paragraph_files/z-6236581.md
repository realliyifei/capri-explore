## (s1) Chromosomal
(p1.0) Three tests have been used to detect chromosomal damage to genetic material in the fetus: assays for chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei, and sister chromatid exchanges in cord blood lymphocytes. Although not all studies are consistent, the majority of studies have found that in adults, smokers have increased frequencies of chromosomal aberrations (24) and sister chromatid exchanges (24)(25)(26). Studies of the effect of smoking on frequencies of micronuclei in lymphocytes have given confficting results (24,25). One study reported small increases in frequencies of SCEs induced by mitomycin C among passive smokers (27).

(p1.1) Although karyotypes are often obtained from infants for diagnosis of genetic diseases, few studies have investigated somatic cell damage by analyses of such specimens for chromosomal aberrations. Two brief reports found no evidence ofincreased chromosomal aberrations among cord blood lymphocytes of smokers (24,28). These studies analyzed cord blood specimens from the offspring of a total of 56 smokers and 42 nonsmokers. In addition, a study of low birth weight infants found no association between birth weight and frequencies of chromosomal aberrations, but did not study the independent effect of smoking (29). Smoking was also not considered in a study that measured the frequency of micronuclei in 28 cord blood specimens (30).

(p1.2) Data from four studies (31-34) evaluating the frequencies of sister chromatid exchanges among women who smoked during pregnancy and cord blood specimens from their offspring are presented in Figure 1. Each of these studies found appreciably lower rates of sister chromatid exchanges in cord blood lymphocytes than in maternal blood lymphocytes. In two studies (33,34) smoking was associated with increased SCE values in maternal blood. Lack of a smoking effect on maternal cells in the other studies may have been due to the small numbers of subjects studied, concentration of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine used, the relatively low numbers of cigarettes smoked or relatively brief duration of smoking for most women studied (33,34). None of the studies, including that by Lundgren et al. (34), which showed a clear smoking effect in maternal cells and used several assay conditions designed to enhance smoking effects (Fig. 1), found a statistically significant association between smoking and SCE frequencies in cord blood. A total of 134 subjects were included in these studies, with subjects about equally divided between smokers and nonsmokers. Unlike chromosomal aber- and cord blood, by smoking status ofthe mother during pregnancy.
## (s2) Gene or Specific Locus Effects
(p2.0) Although there currently is no well-established method for detecting genetic damage occurring in vivo at the level of the gene or specific locus in human somatic cells, two laboratory approaches are in advanced stages of development. One of these assays, developed by Strauss and Albertini (39), analyzes peripheral blood lymphocytes for resistance to 6-thioguanine. Resistant cells have lost activity of the enzyme hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), presumably due to mutational loss of gene function, making them unable to activate the 6-thioguanine to metabolites that interfere with lymphocyte activation or proliferation. In the initial versions of this assay, resistant cells are scored autoradiographically by their ability to take up tritiated thymidine (39). Recent technical developments provide an alternative means for scoring: the ability of lymphocytes to make clones (40)(41)(42)(43). Genetic material from clones obtained by the latter approach can then be analyzed further, allowing demonstration of the molecular basis of changes at the HGPRT locus. Using this approach, in early studies, restriction-fragment analysis using Southern blots showed substantial gene alterations not visible cytogenetically in about 50% of 6-thioguanine-resistant lymphocyte clones. Changes included apparent deletions, new bands, and exon amplifications (44,45).

(p2.1) A second technique for direct measurement of putative mutations in somatic cells is the detection of gene loss by quantitating erythrocytes that have lost expression of glycophorin-A membrane antigens. Individuals heterozygous at the glycophorin locus should have two glycophorin antigens on the surface of their red cells.

(p2.2) This assay quantitates the frequency at which red cells from heterozygous individuals do not react with monoclonal antibodies against one of the antigens. Advantages of the glycophorin-A assay are that it requires fewer in vitro manipulations than the lymphocyte assays, it uses a more homogeneous target tissue, and it has a more automated scoring system (46,47).
