## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Atmospheric fine particles are linked to adverse health effects, visibility reduction and climate change.Particulate organic matter (POM) makes up a large, and often dominant, fraction of fine particulate mass in the atmosphere, typically 20-60% in the continental mid-latitudes (Kanakidou et al., 2005;Yu et al., 2007a;Zhang et al., 2007a;Docherty et al., 2008) and up to 90% in tropical forested areas (Kanakidou et al., 2005).Despite the abundance of atmospheric POM, the ambient composition remains poorly understood due to large measurement uncertainties (Turpin et al., 2000) and chemical complexity (Goldstein and Galbally, 2007).Atmospheric POM has both primary (directly emitted) and secondary (formed in the atmosphere from precursor gases) sources, which can be natural (e.g.vegetation) or anthropogenic (e.g.fossil-based motor vehicle exhaust).Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) contributions to POM vary with season and location but are typically substantial, 20-80% of measured mass (Dechapanya et al., 2004;deGouw et al., 2005;Yu et al., 2007a;Lanz et al., 2007Lanz et al., , 2008)).

(p0.1) Recently it has been noted that current atmospheric models underpredict organic aerosol mass in both the boundary layer and aloft (Heald et al., 2005;Morris et al., 2005;Volkamer et al., 2006;Morris et al., 2006;Goldstein and Galbally, 2007;Yu et al., 2008).Without proper representation of organic aerosol in atmospheric models, development of effective air quality management plans designed to mitigate adverse POM health, visibility, and climate effects is hindered.The reason for the widespread negative bias in model predictions of POM may result from a number of potential causes, Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.
## (s4) Studies of formation of low-volatility species from aqueous oxidation
(p4.0) In recent years it has been demonstrated that aqueous-phase processing of organics in clouds and aerosols may contribute an additional source of SOA to the atmosphere.Aqueous aerosol formation pathways are well known for inorganic secondary species, for example, particulate sulfate derived from the oxidation of SO 2 and dimethylsulfide (DMS).By analogy, water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC's), even if highly volatile, can partition into cloud droplets and oxidize further, affecting the chemistry of radical, metal, and oxidant species (Aumont et al., 2000), and generating lower volatility products that may remain in the particle phase upon cloud droplet evaporation (Ervens et al., 2004;Lim et al., 2005).
## (s5) Mechanism of SOA formation from isoprene oxidation
(p5.0) Results from both field and laboratory studies indicate that the oxidation of isoprene contributes to atmospheric SOA via the formation of low-volatility species.As is the case with all SOA precursors, the detailed chemical mechanism of SOA production from isoprene remains highly uncertain, due to the complexity of the reaction pathways and large number of difficult-to-measure molecular products.However, recent studies of the gas-phase oxidation pathways and the chemical composition of isoprene SOA have yielded substantial insight into many of the general features of the SOA formation mechanism.A highly simplified general mechanism of the OH-initiated oxidation of isoprene is shown in Fig. 1.Not shown are the reaction pathways arising from reactions with other oxidants (O 3 , NO 3 , Cl), which in general have received less study.NO 3 and Cl pathways are expected to be similar to those formed via OH (Fan and Zhang, 2004); ozonolysis proceeds by a very different channel, but was shown to form SOA in relatively low yields (Kleindienst et al., 2007b).
## (s11) Relative humidity (RH)
(p11.0) RH also varied from study to study (Table 1).Dommen et al. (2006) found that SOA yields did not change when RH was varied over a range of 2% to 85%, suggesting RH has little effect on the gas-phase production or partitioning of semivolatiles.However, RH might affect aerosol formation by controlling the liquid water content of the aerosol, which, in turn, may promote gas-particle partitioning and/or heterogeneous reactions of WSOC (Volkamer et al., 2009).The effect of liquid water content on SOA yields has not been explored for isoprene SOA and is an important area of future research, as recent process-level modeling predicts isoprene SOA yields should be RH dependent (Pankow and Chang, 2008).However, since all experiments so far have been carried out at relatively low RH and/or in the absence of organic seed, this potential effect probably cannot explain the large variability in measured SOA yields (Fig. 3).
## (s15) Rate of semivolatile formation
(p15.0) Alternately, OH levels may impact SOA yields by controlling the rate of production of semivolatile organics.Such a "rate effect" is expected, as fast production of semivolatiles will lead to more partitioning into the aerosol phase, where they will be less susceptible to loss processes (Camredon et al., 2007;Kroll et al., 2007;Chan et al., 2007).As the NO x concentration is a major determinant of OH concentration, the overall NO x dependence of SOA formation can be complex (Kroll et al., 2006); this effect has been described in detail by Camredon et al. (2007).
## (s16) Other parameters
(p16.0) In summary, the high degree of variability in measured SOA yields from isoprene photooxidation can largely be attributed to: organic aerosol loading M o (which controls gas-particle partitioning of semivolatiles), NO x level (which controls RO 2 chemistry), and OH concentration (which controls extent and rate of reactions).Temperature and relative humidity seem to play a minor role in comparison.Still, the role of other reaction conditions or experimental parameters cannot be ruled out.Composition of seed particles may affect yields: aerosol growth is highly correlated with aerosol acidity, due to the importance of particle-phase reactions (Edney et al., 2005;Kleindienst et al., 2006;Surratt et al., 2007b); however, it should be noted that chamber measurements involving acidic seed (Kleindienst et al., 2006) exhibit a dependence on M o that is in line with those carried out under neutral conditions (Fig. 3).There is also recent evidence that oxidative processing of WSOC within aqueous aerosol may also promote aerosol growth (Volkamer et al., 2009).Other effects include the intensity and wavelength of irradiation (Presto and Donahue, 2006;Warren et al., 2008) that may photolyze intermediates, the role of high concentrations of radical precursors (H 2 O 2 , NO 2 , etc.), and the loss of semivolatiles and particles to chamber walls.The effects of these parameters on isoprene SOA yields (as a function of M o )
## (s21) Future directions
(p21.0) Based on evidence collected through laboratory, field, and modeling studies, we conclude that isoprene SOA is indeed an important contributor to the atmospheric organic aerosol burden, though substantial uncertainties remain.Estimates for current production rates are ∼6-30 Tg yr −1 , with aqueous processes potentially providing an additional 2 Tg yr −1 (Lim et al., 2005).For comparison, the global estimate of fossil fuel contribution to the atmospheric POM burden is approximately 2 Tg (Ito and Penner, 2005).Therefore, isoprenederived SOA mass represents an important component of atmospheric organic aerosol, roughly up to 30% of the global annual POM budget (Heald et al., 2008).Parameters used in CMAQ simulations (Fig. 4).Note: molecular weights and enthalpy of vaporization ( H vap ) values are from Henze and Seinfeld (2008) and listed in Table 2.

(p21.1) The large range in estimates of the contribution of isoprene SOA to the total particulate burden derives in part from uncertainties in the parameterization of SOA yields from laboratory studies.We have tried to show that much of the apparent discrepancies in laboratory measurements of isoprene SOA yields (Fig. 3) can be explained in terms of differences in reaction conditions (M o , NO x , etc.).The suggested yield parameterizations provided here (Table 3), based on all available laboratory data (where M o =0-50 µg m −3 ), allows for the calculation of SOA yields as a function of both M o and NO x and provides a means for models to include SOA formation from isoprene in a way that is broadly consistent with chamber results.

(p21.2) It is hoped that this new parameterization will shrink the range in estimates of the importance of isoprene to the total atmospheric particulate burden; however there are still substantial uncertainties that need to be addressed.Examples include the temperature dependence of SOA formation (at present, there is only one measurement of H vap,eff for isoprene SOA) and the role of particle composition (e.g.acidity) in the formation of low-volatility organics.The importance of oxidative processes within clouds and aerosols is also poorly constrained, in part because there are few laboratory measurements and simple parameterizations of SOA yields from such reactions, needed for atmospheric models, are dependent not only on the chemistry but on meteorology as well (Ervens et al., 2008).Finally, standard frameworks for representing SOA formation within atmospheric models assume SOA formation is a single-step process, and do not reflect the multistep nature of isoprene oxidation.This shortcoming may be addressed by modeling SOA formation from individual first-generation products (methacrolein, etc.), rather than collectively as isoprene SOA.However, this will require the laboratory study of SOA formation from a larger number of species, and also an improved understanding of the chemical mechanisms underlying multistep isoprene oxidation (in particular the distribution of 2nd-and later-generation products).Alternatively, recently-suggested approaches for modeling SOA, such as the "volatility basis set" approach (Donahue et al., 2006) or the "carbon number-polarity grid" (Pankow and Barsanti, 2009) are well-suited for including the effects of multiple generations of oxidation.However, these too require further experimental constraints on the changes of organics upon atmospheric oxidation.We note that most of these uncertainties are not limited only to isoprene SOA, and instead apply to SOA formation in general.
