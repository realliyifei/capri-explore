Fields: Medicine

## (s6) Bronchoscopy in Obesity
(p6.0) A study in 2016 looked at the percentages of complications according to various indices of obesity. (11) Early termination of the procedure is seen more in obese patients than in non-obese, 6.41 vs 2.78
## (s7) Premedication in Bronchoscopy
(p7.0) Routine use of anticholinergics like atropine and glycopyrrolate is not recommended anymore. (12) They may reduce secretions but no reduction in cough, discomfort, desaturation, and procedure time. They have even been shown to be harmful and may contribute to hemodynamic instability.

(p7.1) Topical lidocaine may decrease the cough and the total dose of sedation. Either 1% or 2% should be used. Both have similar efficacy. A 4% concentration is not recommended as it may get absorbed and cause toxicity, including methemoglobinemia. ACCP and Thorax guidelines recommend 7mg/kg body weight to minimize the risk of complications. (13,14,15) Nebulized lidocaine, in addition to topical lidocaine, has no benefit. (16,17,18) Discontinue clopidogrel (Plavix) 5-7 days before the procedure, especially if a transbronchial biopsy is planned.
