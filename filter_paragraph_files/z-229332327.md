## (s5) Study selection
(p5.0) During the electronic database research process, about 80 articles were identified as potentially relevant. Forty-two (42) papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria (i.e. relation between COVID-19 pandemic and violence against women) and were included in the review, as reported in Table 1.

(p5.1) The remaining articles were excluded because they dealt with psychiatric outcomes after the COVID-19 outbreak or with the maltreatment of children and the related consequences in the COVID-era, and consequently they were not pertinent to the purpose of the study.
## (s8) Raising awareness on the problem of VAW during the current COVID-19 pandemic
(p8.0) Many studies provided warnings about the risk of higher domestic violence rates, as a direct consequence of the restrictions established by most of the countries all over the world to manage the pandemic [38,44,50,35,40,36,46].
## (s9) Trend of calls denouncing VAW during the current COVID-19 pandemic
(p9.0) In many countries all over the world a huge increase has been reported in the number of calls (comparing with the same period in 2019) from women subjected to violence by their intimate partner from the COVID-19 pandemic declaration in March 2020, when the recommendation for social distancing first issued in many countries [24]. The World Health Organization reported that, comparing April 2020 with the same month last year, the online inquiries to violence prevention support hotlines had also increased as much as fivefold [24].
## (s12) Summary of key findings
(p12.0) The current rapid critical review of the literature revealed that there is a higher risk of domestic violence, as a direct consequence of the restrictions established by most of the countries all over the world to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Several studies reported a huge increase in the number of calls (comparing with the same period in 2019) from women victims of IPV from March 2020. However, rigorous studies estimating increases in reporting of VAW during COVID19 pandemic are scarce, as with earlier outbreaks such as the Ebola and Zika which also shored up serious consequences for women. In addition, among the papers included in the investigation dealing with the trend of calls denouncing VAW during COVID-19 pandemic, most of the published data derives from social media, the internet, anecdotal evidence and helplines reports and only few studies concern casuistry from police reports.

(p12.1) As the world is trying to cope with the current COVID-19 crisis by enforcing lockdown measures, many countries resorted to 'stay at home' orders. However, the 'stay home, save lives' mantra, which protects the public from COVID-19 infection, becomes a paradox in the context of domestic violence [21,6,16]. Measures to minimize the spread of the infection reinforce environments that facilitate behaviors perpetrated by one person within an intimate relationship to exert power over and inflict physical, psychological or sexual harm on another. The stress of confinement, financial uncertainty, attitudes about gender roles and a desire for control during disasters all contribute to an increased risk of IPV [30].

## (s29) Trend of calls denouncing VAW during the current COVID-19 pandemic
(p29.0) In many countries all over the world a huge increase has been reported in the number of calls (comparing with the same period in 2019) from women subjected to violence by their intimate partner from the COVID-19 pandemic declaration in March 2020, when the recommendation for social distancing first issued in many countries [24].
