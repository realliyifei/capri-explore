## (s3) Chart 1 -Frequencies of breastfeeding in the first month of life in selected cohort studies published from 2015 to 2020.
(p3.0) • Only breast milk (BM), without other liquids or solids, except for drops or syrups containing vitamins, oral rehydration salts, mineral supplements, or medications (WHO, 2008); • BM only (direct from breast or pumped), which prevents any other liquid or solid food, except syrups/drops of vitamins, medicines, or mineral supplements (WHO 1991); • Breastfeeding without the introduction of other foods or liquids (not even water), with the exception of drops or syrups consisting of vitamins, mineral supplements, or remedies (Labbok;Krasovec, 1990); • Definitions without bibliographic reference:

(p3.1) feeding only with BM, except water and juices (Oribe et al., 2015); only BM since birth (Shao et al., 2018); only BM from the breast or pumped (Noble et al., 2019). Thus, it is emphasized that 30% of the selected studies (n=5) used definitions of EBF that were incomplete, existed prior to the most recent WHO classification published in 2008, or definitions without citation of the bibliographic reference used.

(p3.2) To measure EBF, different evaluation methods were used: daily recording calendar (n=2); dietary recall from Chart 1 -Continuation birth (n=4) or from the 7 days prior to the interview (n=1); 24hR (n=2) or 24hR applied weekly combined with monthly questionnaire on infant feeding practices (n=1); and 41% of the studies (n=7) did not detail the method used or applied other surveys than those recommended by the WHO. Based on these investigations and for the purposes of this review, it was possible to obtain information on the occurrence of EBF at 30 days of life for all studies; and, less frequently, the data referring to the beginning of BF and/or EBF, commonly presented as the rate of onset on the first day or hospital discharge, was also obtained.
