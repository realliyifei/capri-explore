## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Garcinia cambogia is a native fruit of the South-East Asian region, with a diameter of approx.1.5 inches and a green-to-yellow color change in the maturation process.However, the fruits are too acidic to eat.Different parts are used as food preservatives, spices, and bulking agents for foodstuffs.It is most often used for culinary purposes, especially for fish curries and 'Asam laksa.The G. cambogia fruit extract for constipation, hemorrhoids, and intestinal parasites has been used.Edemas, rheumatism and irregular menstruation are other medicinal uses.Whilst many chemicals from cambogia have been isolated, hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is considered the weight-loss ingredient. [1]Between 20 to 60% of hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is found in garcinia supplements, and many of these products contain many active components in addition to Garcinia cambogia.When evaluating the quality, effectiveness, and safety of these items, this should also be taken into account, as have been reported for other natural products in several studies. [2,3]Additionally, it has been stated that the claimed concentration of HCA in many products is lower than the amount stated.Many clinical studies have been performed on the effectiveness of cambogia for obesity. [4]Cambogia is planted and manufactured in mass quantities and is an important economic product in India, thanks to its outstanding therapeutic value.Figure 1 shows the image of Garcinia cambogia.This study concisely reviewed the health, medicinal, and therapeutic roles of Garcinia cambogia and its bioactive constituents. [5itric acid can also be used as the starting point for the manufacture of hydroxycitric acid.Dehydration of the acid first forms aconitic acid, which then undergoes oxidation to create hydroxycitric acid.According to research, HCA inhibits the enzyme adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase, which catalyses the additional mitochondrial breakdown of citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), a precursor to the production of fatty acids.According to several research, HCA helps people lose weight without activating their central nervous system.It is obvious that there are numerous opposing opinions on the effectiveness and safety of G. cambogia.This study provides a concise summary of the scientific data on the biological activity and toxicity of Garcinia cambogia and HCA as well as phytochemical.

## (s1) Botanical description
(p1.0) In the Clusiaceae family Garcinia is the largest of 390 species.The plant is distributed primarily in tropical Asia.It has a circular crown and tilted branches up to 12 meters high and is small or medium sized.The young twigs are subtle, glabrous, reddish-brown and lenticellate.The hooks are dark-green and are brilliant on the face, with pétioles 5-16 centimeters long and 5-13 for linen 2-6 centimeters.The leaves are elliptic, oblanceolate, with the apex usually shaped acutely and rarely. [7,8]The rose polygamous flora is axilla or terminal with a sepal and petal cream.Flowers occur in summer and fruiting occurs during rainy season (June-September).The eggs have a width of about 5 cm and diameters of 6 to 8 rags.When ripe, the fruit can be yellow, orange or red.It contains 6 to 8 succulent aril seeds.Tree growth is slow.In four healthy adult volunteers, the bioavailability of HCA-SX was evaluated.These authors administered HCA-SX 2 g under quick conditions and each 30 minutes they measured HCA-SX plasma concentrations for four hours in total.HCA-SX plasma levels after administration were 0.8 μg/mL 30 minutes and 8.4 μg/mL 2 hours after intake.The peak after administration was between 4.7 and 8.4 μg/mL.Although HCA-SX plasma levels started to decline after 2.5 hours, they remained much higher than pre-administration values.The study showed that the HCA-SX absorption intake is relatively rapid after acute consumption and that the product remains in plasma for several hours. [6]
## (s10) Hypolipidaemic and antioxidant activity
(p10.0) Flavonoids can inhibit different stages in which atherosclerosis, damage to endothelia, activation of leucocytes, adhesion platelets and aggregation and secretion occur. [10,34]The plasma total cholesterol and atherogenic index have decreased by 1 to 2% by supplementing tea catechins with a rat diet.Tannic acid and Morin can cause beneficial plasma lipid changes in the heart disease-related type.[37] A study evaluated the hypolipidemic activity of the Garcinia cambogia fruit, which in Indian medicine has a high therapeutical value and is even now used in medicines for different diseases. [22]A study investigated the antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant activities of the ethanolic extract of Garcinia cambogia on high fat diet-fed rats.Male Wistar rats were fed with either standard rodent diet or 30% high-fat diet and administered with GE at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight/day for 10 weeks.At the end, lipid profile and oxidative stress parameters were estimated.Results of the study showed that administration of GE decreased food intake, plasma TC, TAG, non HDL-C, MDA, increased HDL-C and blood antioxidants GSH, GPx, catalase.GE also reduced TOS, OSI and elevated TAS in plasma and liver of fat-fed rats.Renal OSI was significantly reduced upon GE treatment.Garcinia was effective in ameliorating high-fat-diet-induced hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress. [38]An in vitro antioxidant activity in fruit rin, hydroxyl radical scavenging, thiocyanate ferrous, total peroxide radical trapping and lipid peroxidation testing were reported in aqueous extract.In vitro protective effects against lipid and protein oxidation have been shown in garcinol and guttiferone K isolated from the fruit.The growth of plasma, platelet and thiobarbituric acid-reactive species induced by peroxynitrite in both cases has reduced significantly the growth of carbonyl groups.These compounds, however, did not inhibit the plasma and platelet nitrate induced by peroxynitrite [N.H. [39] ]
## (s13) Anticholinesterase activity
(p13.0) In acetyl-cholinesterase enzymes, neuromuscular joints and cholinergic brain synapses play a crucial role for acetylcholine, a major neurotransmitter.This enzyme is responsible for the loss of cognitive capacity, the first stage of the disease of Alzheimer's. [6]Cambogia fruit rind extract produced significant activity with cholinesterase inhibition of 30% and 30% and 67%, respectively, of 500 and 1000 μg/ml.The activity is comparable to the positive neostigmine control with inhibited 5 and 10 μg/mL of 78 and 92% cholinesterase.
## (s15) Effects on fertility
(p15.0) An ethanol extract from the cambogia seeds was administered to male rats 6 days a week to examine its impact on testis histology as well as the sperm count for 6 weeks.The extract increased the sperm count and interstitial spaces considerably at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg BW/day, causing degenerating and distorting the cells of the sperm series in all experimental rats. [18]The level of testis meiosis-aktivating sterol, which may be responsible for the transmission of the spermatogenesis signal, was reduced by oral administration at 102 mmol/kg of BW to male rats, which is intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis.The serum hormone levels -follicle-stimulating hormones, luteinizing hormone, estradiol and progesterone -have not changed in female rats, shows a subsequent study by the same group that (−) HCA administered at a dose of 154 mmol kg−1 day−1 for 4 weeks.The concentrations of follicle and corpus luteum, the follicular fluid ovarienic meiosis-activating sterol and the sterol testis have not changed over the course of the treatment.After treatment, body weight and abdominal fat decreased (Shaik et al.,  2017). [44]xicity of Garcinia cambogia

(p15.1) The majority of research agrees that taking Garcinia cambogia in the recommended quantities, which is up to 2,800 mg of HCA per day, is safe for healthy persons.Garcinia cambogia has also been linked to certain negative side effects.Digestive problems, headaches, and skin rashes are the most prevalent.However, more significant adverse effects have been reported in other trials.Garcinia cambogia consumption well beyond the maximum suggested dosage has been shown in animal tests to induce testicular atrophy, or shrinkage of the testicles.It has been shown in rats that it can influence sperm production.One lady suffered serotonin poisoning as a result of taking Garcinia cambogia with her antidepressant medicines, according to one study.Furthermore, numerous case studies show that Garcinia cambogia pills may cause liver damage or even death in certain people [45]
