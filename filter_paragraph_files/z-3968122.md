(p12.0) Augmented Reality: a musical game helping patients in colors and sounds memorization tasks. Probosz et al, 2009 Stroke VR systems support cognitive rehabilitation by providing logopaedic help and reducing the somatic effects of paresis though a multi-sensorial brain stimulation approach. Koenig et al.,2009 Brain injury VR approach to assess the patient's performance in tasks of way-finding and in the training of spatial orientation skills. discharge from hospital and transfer to programs for rehabilitation at home, with improved quality of life and clinical outcome. In general, the scenario would motivate research to achieve widespread application, possibly by making home rehabilitation under remote control a realistic option and by extending VR use to the computer or technology illiterate.
