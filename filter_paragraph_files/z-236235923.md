## (s9) | Diagnostic utility
(p9.0) An important consideration for the clinical applicability of PET/MRI in dementia is the perception of clinical utility. Compared to other cerebral disorders (e.g., tumours, stroke), dementia and associated pathology is underemphasised in radiology teaching, with few radiological reports suggesting dementia diagnoses despite identification of characteristic atrophy patterns. 74 In practice, MRI and PET images are often interpreted by different subspecialist radiologists, with integration of these separate findings often left to the referring clinician. 75 Mukku et al. 43 examined the diagnostic utility of 18 FDG-PET/MRI in dementia diagnoses, finding that biomarkers of hypometabolism and structural atrophy showed 90.5% concordance with clinical diagnoses, and further assisted with diagnostic subtyping.
