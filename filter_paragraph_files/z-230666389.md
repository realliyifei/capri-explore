## (s3) Breastfeeding
(p3.0) The establishment of the microbiome in childhood is important for its microbialimmune crosstalk that is thought to be involved in the pathobiology of disease later in life [37]. A longitudinal study demonstrated that after an early developmental and transitional phase in gut microbial composition, a period of microbial stability is reached by as early as 31 months [38]. The most significant factor associated with the early microbial structure is whether or not an individual was breastfed, and it also appears that this is a significant risk factor for the development of IBD. A recent meta-analysis found that breastfeeding (BF) was protective against the development of both forms of IBD, reducing the risk of developing CD (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.85) and UC (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.91) [39]. This protective effect was accentuated if the duration of breastfeeding was greater than 12 months.
## (s4) Dietary Fibre
(p4.0) Dietary fibre provides a substrate for the bacteria that inhabit the distal gut, and these bacteria are integral to its handling. Humans produce approximately 17 enzymes to digest fibre. However, these bacteria produce thousands of complementary enzymes to depolymerise and ferment dietary polysaccharides into host absorbable SCFAs. These SCFAs include butyrate, propionate and acetate. Bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum that possess this capability are less abundant in the gut of IBD patients [26]. The IBD-altered microbiota composition results in lower production of anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory metabolites, in particular butyrate, a lack of which may contribute to increased intestinal inflammation [53].

(p4.1) SCFAs reduce the inflammatory immune response through multiple mechanisms, including reducing the permeability of the intraepithelial barrier; interacting directly with immune cells and indirectly on the production of signaling cytokines and chemokines to collectively decrease proinflammatory mediators and increase immune-tolerant responses. The proposed mechanisms of these impacts are summarised in Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 1. 
## (s5) Dietary Fibre
(p5.0) Dietary fibre provides a substrate for the bacteria that inhabit the distal gut, and these bacteria are integral to its handling. Humans produce approximately 17 enzymes to digest fibre. However, these bacteria produce thousands of complementary enzymes to depolymerise and ferment dietary polysaccharides into host absorbable short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These SCFAs include butyrate, propionate and acetate. Bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum that possess this capability are less abundant in the gut of IBD patients [26]. The IBD-altered microbiota composition results in lower production of anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory metabolites, in particular butyrate, a lack of which may contribute to increased intestinal inflammation [53].

(p5.1) SCFAs reduce the inflammatory immune response through multiple mechanisms, including reducing the permeability of the intraepithelial barrier; interacting directly with immune cells and indirectly on the production of signaling cytokines and chemokines to collectively decrease proinflammatory mediators and increase immune-tolerant responses. The proposed mechanisms of these impacts are summarised in Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 1. Animal models of colitis have shown that dietary fibre intake is protective, particularly if given before the exposure leading to the development of colitis [54]. This may be mediated through the protection from disruption of the gut mucus layer that occurs during active disease [55]. Desai and colleagues demonstrated that fed a low-fibre diet, the gut microbiota in mice resorted to mucus layer glycoproteins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the colonic mucus barrier, which serves as a primary defence against enteric pathogens [56].

## (s11) Gluten
(p11.0) Gluten is a factor contributing to intestinal inflammation in TNF-α knockout mice (a mouse model of genetic predisposition to IBD). It is postulated that amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), a family of non-gluten proteins found in gluten containing cereals can regulate the release of inflammatory cytokines, activate Toll-Like Receptors and induce a T-cell response in both coeliac and non-coeliac patients, including those with IBD [69,70].
## (s13) Gluten
(p13.0) Gluten is a factor contributing to intestinal inflammation in TNF-α knockout mice (a mouse model of genetic predisposition to IBD). It is postulated that amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), a family of non-gluten proteins found in gluten containing cereals can regulate the release of inflammatory cytokines, activate Toll-Like Receptors and induce a T-cell response in both coeliac and non-coeliac patients, including those with IBD [69,70].
## (s16) Vitamin D and Calcium
(p16.0) Osteoporosis is common in patients with IBD. Nutritional deficiencies, including low vitamin D and poor calcium intake are contributing factors, as is chronic inflammation, corticosteroid use and extensive small bowel disease or resection [86].

(p16.1) Vitamin D is synthesised by UV exposure, with smaller amounts being derived from dietary sources such as oily fish and dairy products [87]. Vitamin D preserves and restores epithelial barrier function, in particular via promoting the expression of tight junction proteins [88]. It also inhibits the maturation of dendritic cells and decreases production of co-stimulatory molecules leading to decreased effector T-cell activation [89]. Mice fed a vitamin D-deficient diet had an increased susceptibility to colitis [90]. The immune effects of vitamin D deficiency may be mediated by microbial interactions, with vitamin D and/or vitamin D receptor-deficient mice demonstrating increased bacterial counts in colonic tissue (suggesting bacterial invasion), altered relative abundance of less favourable bacteria including increased Proteobacteria and Bacteroides whilst relative quantities of favourable Firmicutes were decreased [90][91][92].

(p16.2) In a study which examined the Nurses Heath cohort, a validated prediction model of serum vitamin D which included dietary assessment as well as other lifestyle factors was utilised. It found that compared with those with a predicted vitamin D in the lowest quartile, those with predicted levels in the highest quartile had a reduced risk of developing CD but not of UC [44]. This finding was not replicated in the EPIC cohort of 359,728 participants followed for up to 15.7 years. In this study, no significant association between serum vitamin D and IBD risk was found [50].

(p16.3) In a cross-sectional study of 182 CD patients and 62 healthy controls, it was found that low serum levels of vitamin D had an inverse relationship with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), a score used to quantify patients' symptoms, with more severe symptoms attracting higher scores [93]. Another retrospective cohort study demonstrated an inverse relationship between serum vitamin D level and scores of disease activity and health-related quality of life in CD and with disease activity scores but not quality of life in UC. [94]. A large retrospective study of 3217 patients with CD and UC found that low levels of vitamin D (<20 ng/mL) were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation and surgery in both CD and UC. Those who subsequently normalized their level of vitamin D had a reduced risk of surgery compared to those who remained deficient [95]. IBD patients are also at increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis, for which low vitamin D is a significant risk factor [96]. It should be noted that studies looking exclusively at dietary vitamin D rather than serum vitamin D (which may be derived largely from UV or supplemental sources) are lacking.
## (s18) Emulsifiers and Nanoparticles
(p18.0) Emulsifiers are detergent-like molecules used in processed foods that are added to improve texture and quality [134]. However, they may interfere with gut barrier function [135]. In vitro studies have shown significantly increased translocation of E. coli through mucosal cells with the addition of emulsifying agent compared with vegetable-based fibres [111]. In mouse models, the addition of emulsifiers that are commonly used in human food have been associated with decreased mucus thickness, narrowed distance of bacteria to mucosal layer, altered compositions of bacteria, including decreased Bacteroidetes, increased proinflammatory cytokines and a higher incidence of and more extensive colitis in genetically predisposed mice [110].
## (s19) Mediterranean Style Diet
(p19.0) A recent prospective cohort study examined the relationship between consumption of a Mediterranean diet (high in fruit, vegetables, PUFA and protein predominately from fish, legumes and nuts) and the risk of developing CD in a prospective cohort study of 83,147 Swedish adults [52]. They found a dose-effect relationship, with those most adherent to the Mediterranean diet having a lower risk of developing CD. A study examined the dietary intake of 39,511 young women during high school and subsequent development of IBD over 19 year follow up. They found that compared to women who consumed <10 g/day of fish during high school, those with an intake of ≥30 g/day had a 57% lower risk of CD [46]. Fish intake did not appear to modulate UC risk.

(p19.1) In summary, while epidemiological nutritional studies are limited by many confounders, some relationships were strong and consistent across studies. Breast milk, fruit and vegetable intake and an increased ratio of n-3/n-6 fatty acids in the diet appear protective, whereas sugar containing soft drink intake is associated with a greater risk of both forms of IBD. Red meat appears to only be related to risk of UC, and an increased emulsifier and animal fat intake appears to increase the risk of CD. The strongest evidence for risk reduction in the development of CD is with fish, particularly as part of a Mediterranean diet as well as adequate zinc and vitamin D intake, whilst DHA intake may reduce UC risk.

(p19.2) Disease activity may also be modulated by diet, with evidence that dietary fibre, a high dietary n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio may decrease flare risk in both forms of IBD. Factors found to increase flare risk in UC include myristic acid and red meat. Zinc and vitamin D levels have been inversely associated with levels of disease activity and poorer health outcomes in both forms of IBD. Diets low in gluten and FODMAPs have been shown to improve residual symptoms in those with IBD in remission, specifically in those with concomitant IBS.
## (s20) Diet as Prescribed Therapy for Active Disease in IBD
(p20.0) There are several prescriptive dietary approaches that have been studied for use in routine clinical practice to manage IBD flares (Table 4). Due to the restrictive nature of these dietary regimens, they are largely reserved for the most unwell patients or those wanting to avoid the use of steroid-based medications, particularly children in whom steroids can impact upon growth trajectory [142]. 
## (s22) Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN)
(p22.0) Dietary food components may contribute to the inflammatory processes during a flare of IBD. EEN is an elemental diet, which involves the provision of 100% of a person's nutritional requirement as a liquid nutrition formula delivered enterally (either orally or via nasogastric tube) over a period of 6-8 weeks [149]. The mechanism of its efficacy is still poorly understood. However, there are changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome [150]. EEN significantly decreases the gut bacterial diversity below pretreatment levels. One theory is that the bowel rest induced by EEN facilitates mucosal healing by limiting the activity of pathogenic microbes [149]. EEN has been found to be particularly beneficial in the paediatric setting and in CD rather than UC. A randomised controlled trial that looked at both clinical remission and mucosal healing at week 10 in a paediatric CD population comparing EEN and oral corticosteroids showed equivalent rates of clinical remission and superior rates of mucosal healing in the EEN group [143]. Studies looking at the utility of EEN in the adult IBD population have yielded less dramatic benefits. Meta-analyses on the topic have suggested that there is weak evidence of the benefit of EEN for the induction and maintenance of IBD remission compared to placebo in adult patients with CD, but not compared to corticosteroids [151,152]. One of the main barriers to efficacy is patient adherence to EEN therapy [144].

(p22.1) There is marked heterogeneity in the macronutrient and additive composition of EEN formulas. An informative study was performed which compared the nutritional and additive content of 61 formulas with published efficacy in the management of active CD with equivalent rates of remission [153]. Interestingly, many dietary components that have been implicated in triggering CD, such as high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios (derived from vegetable oils), refined sugar and additives such as emulsifiers, maltodextrin and carrageenan, were contained in these formulas despite their efficacy in the treatment of active CD. This may suggest that despite epidemiological, pre-clinical and select clinical data suggesting benefits of excluding these dietary components, their impact in the context of active disease cannot be assumed to be significant without further well-designed prospective clinical studies. Of note, all formulas were lactose free and gluten free and 82% lacked fibre, suggesting that these macronutrients may be aspects of dietary management that are important considerations in the context of active disease.
## (s24) Real Food Diet
(p24.0) The CD-TREAT study evaluated the effects of an individualised food-based diet, which aimed to re-create the benefits of an EEN diet by exclusion of specific dietary components, such as gluten, lactose and alcohol. It was found to have a similar impact to EEN on the gut microbiome, inflammation and clinical response in a rat model as well as in healthy adults and children with CD. This diet was easier for patients to comply with and more acceptable than EEN [147].
