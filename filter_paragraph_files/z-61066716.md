## (s1) Previous work
(p1.0) This article updates and complements a previous attempt at surveying Swahili dictionaries using a computational method.Hurskainen (2004) considers five different dictionaries, which are converted into worsened finite-state morphological analyzers.Their generative power is consequently evaluated on three different corpora and their coverage is compared to that of SWATWOL (Hurskainen 1992), a comprehensive Swahili parser.

(p1.1) The publication, however, does not make it clear how the dictionaries were obtained or converted into digital format, nor does it provide any insight into how the morphological information contained in them is translated into a morphological analyzer.That said, it seems counter-intuitive to evaluate a dictionary as a morphological description of a language, rather than as a lexical one.

(p1.2) Our survey employs an alternative computational and corpus-based evaluation technique, one which can easily be replicated and one which addresses some of the issues apparent in Hurskainen (2004).We focus on readily available digital dictionaries, dictionaries that can easily be converted into a unified database format.As such, only one dictionary is covered by both Hurskainen ( 2004) and our survey.We add to our comparison three recently published dictionaries, including the expansive Internet Living Swahili Dictionary, which was strangely absent from Hurskainen (2004).

(p1.3) Our evaluation method uses a single, comprehensive Swahili lemmatizer, which is used to retrieve lemmas for word forms in a large Swahili corpus.The lemmatizer that was used in our experiments, allows us to simply evaluate the dictionaries in terms of how many lemmas in the corpus they cover, regardless of the morphological information they encode.Contrary to Hurskainen (2004) we also focus our evaluation of bilingual dictionaries on their potential as tools in machine translation, by comparing their coverage on a parallel corpus.
