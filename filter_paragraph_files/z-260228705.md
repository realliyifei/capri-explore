## (s4) Method
(p4.0) I identified articles for this review by searching databases, including Education Full Text, ERIC, and JSTOR.I made use of databases that include or focus on empirical education research because I wanted to determine the breadth of empirical research on postsecondary CTE and whether that evidence points to characteristics of successful programs.I searched by using multiple combinations of terms and always included the phrase community college, along with vocational, career technical education, vocational training, or occupational degree.For database searches, I limited searches to English-language articles in peer-reviewed journals published since 1998. 5I limited my search to research published within approximately the last 20 years because my central question is about how current practices can inform future program design.I completed the last searches in 2021, although additional papers were added during the publication process.Alexander (2020) wrote that the quality of the research included in a review matters because ultimately one's findings are relying on the assumption that the results reported in the underlying literature are valid.In this first stage of searching, I limited my searches to peer-reviewed articles because it is a widely accepted indicator of research quality.

(p4.1) Following Alexander (2020), Figure 1 displays my search process.The initial database searches yielded 592 unduplicated records.After reading through the titles of these sources, I discarded 107 because they described vocational education outside the United States.The system of higher education in the United States is unique, and findings in international contexts may not replicate here.Next, I read through the abstracts of all the remaining articles.At this stage, I discarded 394 articles that were not primarily about postsecondary vocational education and, as a result, did not help me answer my research questions.Examples include articles that were primarily about student athletes or study abroad.Appendix A provides a complete list of topics excluded at this stage.I read each of the remaining articles in full and excluded 57 that were not empirical (i.e., not based on transparent methods of data collection and analysis).Several of these articles were from such journals as the Community College Journal.The articles described innovative practices and were written by a journalist or practitioner.

(p4.2) Although some of these articles provided more specific details about postsecondary vocational courses and programs of study than I was able to find in the empirical literature, I chose to exclude them because they did not include methods sections or describe their research process.As a result, I could not judge the quality of the research.Moreover, these articles did not examine the effects of course or program components on student outcomes.

(p4.3) At the end of this process, 34 articles remained.After examining this list, I expanded my sources by mining the bibliographies of these articles for additional pieces that would help me answer my research questions.In this way, I added an additional 16 sources to this review, for a total of 50 articles.At this stage, I also expanded my search to include non-peer-reviewed white papers and reports published by highly respected research centers or firms that produce research on postsecondary CTE.These additional sources were the Community College Research Center, the Rand Corporation, MDRC, American Institutes for Research, Mathematica, Westat, and Abt.I searched the websites of these organizations for papers that addressed my research question about the effect of participating in postsecondary CTE on student outcomes.This search resulted in 11 additional sources, which I added to this review.

(p4.4) I grouped articles by research question and then thematically coded the results and discussion sections.Initially, themes included "vocational student characteristic," "labor market outcome," and "program design."However, additional themes, such as, "accountability," "online learning," and "transfer as outcome," emerged through the process of coding.Finally, after coding, I determined that nine sources focused on the policy context surrounding postsecondary vocational education or the mission of community colleges belonged in the background and framing sections of this paper.An additional 12 sources were discarded during the publication process, and seven were added.This left me with 47 sources for the review.
## (s11) Evidence on Program Designs or Characteristics
(p11.0) Carruthers and Sanford (2018) used administrative data from Tennessee and an individual fixed effects approach to estimate the economic returns to students at Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology (TCATs), a 27-campus network of public vocational training centers.TCATs offer certificates and diplomas similar to those of community colleges, in such fields as automotive technology, dental assisting, or machine tool technology.However, credit earned may not be transferable, and training is done in a setting more like a workplace and less like a classroom.A student chooses a program of study and whether they will attend part-or full-time; beyond that, the program is defined for them, so they do not choose individual courses.These schools offer two levels of credentials, but a certificate documents a skill, as opposed to signaling the completion of a program, as it does in other contexts.Students accumulate contact hours rather than credit hours.

(p11.1) On average, students at TCATs experience economic returns to enrolling in and completing programs.Unlike the aforementioned state data studies, which compared completers to non-completers, Carruthers and Sanford (2018) used Unemployment Insurance data to compare adults completing TCAT credentials to those who never enrolled in a TCAT and reported the returns to "some college."They found that students who left programs even without a credential earned more than did students who never enrolled in a program but had similar earnings histories.The authors found that changing industries explained one-half of the returns to these programs and three-quarters of the wage gains.These findings for students enrolling in TCATs suggest that institutions offering clear pathways through credential programs, even if combined with a limited choice of areas of study, may yield positive outcomes for students.
## (s15) Discussion and Conclusion
(p15.0) The evidence reviewed here suggests that short CTE credentials have value in the labor market and can benefit students, although there is heterogeneity across field of study, credential level, and state context.It also matters whether students seeking short credentials enroll in public or forprofit institutions (Cellini & Turner, 2019).Studies using state longitudinal data to examine average economic returns to different types of short credentials showed heterogeneity across states, but these studies cannot tell us what explains variation in returns.Program quality, local labor-market needs, and occupational licensing laws, among other things, could all contribute to variation in the economic value of short credentials across credential type, field of study, and state.More research is needed to better understand which credentials have value for students and which do not.

(p15.1) The literature on sectoral partnerships examines a relatively small number of programs and provides more details about the components of these programs.These studies did not tell us whether any one program component was the key to success, but they did describe, in detail, some programs that had positive effects on students' labor-market outcomes.These programs were characterized by administrative flexibility and robust relationships with local businesses.Establishing productive collaborations between colleges and local employers seems to be an important part of the process of developing high-quality credentials, although these partnerships may be difficult to develop and maintain (Soliz et al., 2023).Some research on sectoral partnerships suggests that having a third party facilitate the collaboration between an education agency and a local business may help the development of these relationships.Designating individuals and structures (e.g., quarterly meetings) responsible for building and maintaining collaborations may also help (Soliz et al., 2023).Having some business involvement in the development of vocational credentials is probably the most efficient way for college administrators and faculty to be sure that their programs are providing the most up-todate training.Connections with local businesses may also allow students to access internships and to find jobs after graduation.To better understand why some credentials result in better economic outcomes for students than others do, more research is needed that combines rich program descriptions with quantitative evaluations of the impact of participating in these programs.
