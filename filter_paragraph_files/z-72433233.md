## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) X-ray diffraction studies have long been used to obtain information on the short and intermediate range structure of glasses, since the pioneering work of Warren and coworkers in the 1930's [1][2][3].This is still the case, although the measurement accuracy, data analysis procedure, and sophistication of the modeling techniques today are much more rigorous.The work of Narten and colleagues in the 1970's had a large impact on the development of data analysis techniques associated with the X-ray pair distribution function method, using conventional X-ray sources mainly to study the structure of molecular liquids, for example, [4,5].Around the same time, Leadbetter and Wright combined both neutron and X-ray diffraction to study the structure of network glasses [6,7].However the main use of the pair distribution function technique in the field of glasses and liquids centered on neutron diffraction which has been described extensively by Wright [8][9][10] and others.The high-energy X-ray technique (loosely defined as energies >60 keV) is the latest generation of this popular method of determining the structure of disordered materials and has its origins with the seminal work of Egelstaff and Root in the 1980's who used γ-ray diffraction to obtain liquid structure factors [11,12].The breakthrough however came in the mid-90's by Neuefeind and Poulsen [13][14][15], when they adapted this technique to synchrotron radiation using 100 keV X-rays.The triple axis high-energy X-ray diffractometer, BW5, they used for these measurements was built based on the design of the world's best neutron diffractometer at the time, D4C at the Institute Laue Langevin in France [13].The high energy X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) technique has spread in the last decade and current synchrotron beamlines that routinely perform measurements on glasses include: SPring-8, Japan (BL04B2) [16,17], HASYLAB [18], Germany (BW5), European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, France (ID15B), and several beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source, USA; 1-ID (stress/strain, high pressure), 11-ID-B (time resolved, chemical reactions), 11-ID-C [19] (liquid, glass, levitation).In the conference summary of the 10th International conference on the Structure of Non-Crystalline Materials in 2006, X-ray diffraction was identified as the main structural technique used by the participants.

(p0.1) There are two main advantages over conventional Xray diffraction techniques when hard X-rays of ∼100 keV 2 Figure 1: Plots showing the number of papers published per year and their citations from a Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge database search using the key words "high energy X-ray diffraction" and "liquid" or "glass" cross-linked with several of the most prolific authors in the field.These articles were cited 1939 times by 1539 articles (excluding self-citations) with an average of 9.78 citations per item.

(p0.2) are used in experiments on amorphous materials: (i) the structure factors can be measured out to much higher momentum transfers, Q > 20 Å−1 at smaller scattering angles (in 2θ • ), leading to higher real space resolution, and (ii) attenuation and multiple scattering effects are negligible for small samples that is, typically ∼1 mm 3 [13].This is because the photo-electric absorption decreases as ∼E −3 and scattering typically becomes the dominant process, under conditions similar to that of a transmission neutron diffraction experiment.High energy X-ray diffraction is very much a sister technique to neutron diffraction, and as for all glass studies, whenever possible should be combined with other structural probes to maximize the information obtained.Limitations of the technique include that it is not element specific (like EXAFs) and therefore information on low dopant ions (<1%) cannot be obtained.Fluorescence energies of elements in the sample should also be avoided if possible.One of the strengths of high energy diffraction data lies in its ability to provide a rigorous test of atomistic models from computer simulation such as molecular dynamics or density functional theory.It is also often used as a model constraint in inverse computer simulation techniques, such as Reverse Monte Carlo and Empirical Potential Structure Refinement.Some current directions of high energy X-ray synchrotron radiation in glass research include high pressure studies, high and low temperature experiments combined with containerless levitation techniques, and time resolved structural measurements around the glass transition.

(p0.3) To my knowledge there have been three reviews on high energy photon scattering specifically aimed at investigations into the structure of liquids and glasses.The first two were by Dr. J. Neuefeind in 2002 [20] and Professor P. A. Egelstaff in 2003 [21] shortly after high energy X-ray diffraction at third generation synchrotrons was born and these were followed by Dr. S. Kohara et al. review in 2007 [22].During this time and since, the field has grown rapidly driven by advances in instrumentation and detectors at synchrotron sources, as illustrated in Figure 1.Here I attempt to update and rationalize these changes in the context of other current experimental and modeling methods.This paper is from my own perspective working for the past two decades in the field of liquids and glasses, and mainly describes the developments on sectors 1-ID and 11-ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source near Chicago, USA.This paper is by no means meant to be comprehensive and I apologize for those contributions to the field I have inadvertently omitted.
## (s1) γ-Ray Diffraction
(p1.0) Knowing the atomic structure of a material is the starting point for explaining many macroscopic phenomena, unusual properties, or behavior.The ability to probe the bulk local and intermediate range structure of disordered materials is a powerful tool, yet for many materials science problems, more penetration is required than can be provided by conventional X-ray instrumentation.The idea of high energy (low wavelength) radiation combined with low-angle detection came from developments in γ-ray scattering, the precursor to high energy X-ray diffraction.In particular, Egelstaff and Root designed and built a γ-ray diffractometer at the university of Guelph in Canada expressly built to measure liquid Xray structure factors [12].A very stable 60 keV, Americium-241 source was rotated in an arc around the sample with the heavier detector at a fixed position, see Figure 2. The limiting factors associated with these experiments were the low-flux, as experiments would typically take months to complete, which was compensated for by a large sample size leading to poor resolution at low angles and significant geometric, attenuation, and multiple scattering effects.
## (s2) High Energy X-Ray Instrumentation
(p2.0) In the past, spallation neutron diffraction measurements have played an important role in elucidating the bulk structure of materials over a large range of scattering vector Q, covering low scattering angles and short wavelengths, but these experiments require comparatively lengthy counting times and large samples [23].The use of "neutron-like" photons for diffraction studies at synchrotrons uses ca. 100 keV photons to compress a wide Q-range into a small angular cone in the forward scattering direction, providing high real space resolution at low-r values comparable to the best neutron sources.For example, the high energy Xray diffractometer 11-ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source was originally designed and built by Rütt and coworkers at the Basic Energy Sciences Synchrotron Radiation Center (BESSRC) in 2001 [19].It was designed as a triple axis machine using an elliptical multipole wiggler.In 2007 the wiggler was replaced by two in-line undulators in a tandem configuration, one full length undulator A (downstream) and a full length high energy undulator with a period length of 2.3 cm, providing simultaneous high brilliance flux to all three 11-ID stations (B, C, and D).The undulator A is limited to a minimum gap equivalent to k = 2.11 (minimum energy of 4.5 KeV) and the high energy undulator is used at fixed closed gap of 10.5 cm.During a 2010 upgrade the 11-ID-C energy remained fixed at 115 keV using a Laue Si(311) crystal reflection at 1.8 degrees, providing a highly penetrating beam and allowing a wide coverage of reciprocal space over a small angular scattering range.The flux is typically 10 11 photons/sec using a beam size of 1 mm × 1 mm.In 2010, the end station was redesigned to take advantage of the advances in detector technology and rebuilt around a large moveable flat-plate area detector, see Figure 3.The open design, heavy duty sample stage, and extensive range of detector motion on 11-ID-C distinguishes it from beamlines performing similar measurements at other synchrotrons, such as BL04B2 and BL08W at SPring-8 [17] and ID-15B at ESRF.The use of short wavelength X-rays are well suited to experiments that require bulky sample environments and much of the science program at beamline 11-ID-C revolves around studying the structure of phase transitions or materials characterization at nonambient conditions.
## (s3) Data Analysis and Corrections
(p3.0) In the data analysis procedure we can consider three different origins of effects which can affect the accuracy of the extracted X-ray static structure factor [16,24]: (i) effects related to the source for example, polarization, energy resolution, and relativistic effects; (ii) sample and environmental effects for example, container, attenuation, multiple scattering, florescence and (iii) detector effects, for example, geometrical arrangements, oblique incidence, detector efficiency, flat field, dark currents.Many of these have been covered in the literature and can be found here: [16,[24][25][26].These corrections and the order they are applied must be considered together with the removal of the background scattering (air or vacuum plus any windows) and the composition dependent Compton scattering.Removal of the "self scattering" (Compton plus X-ray form factor) allows the extraction of a pseudo-nuclear total X-ray structure factor, S(Q) to be obtained.Provided a wide range of reciprocal space is covered this function can be Fourier transformed into real space to provide an average probability function of all the atomic positions in the material called the radial or pair distribution function G X (r) [1].The G X (r) function can be used to extract bond distances, local coordination numbers, average bond angles, and provide a rigorous test of structural models.In addition, the first sharp diffraction peak at position Q 1 in the X-ray (or neutron) diffraction patterns is associated with the existence of intermediate or medium range order in glass with a periodicity of 2π/Q 1 (although its origin is still controversial).Medium range order has been defined as covering the region ∼5-10 Å, although longer "extended chemical ordering" up to 40 Å has also been found in network glasses.

(p3.1) The sample dependent absorption corrections to the scattered X-ray intensity I X (Q) from a liquid or glass can be reliably applied using the method of Paalman and Pings [27], by independently measuring the sample scattering in a vessel I SV 0 , the empty vessel I V 0 and the background B,

(p3.2) where the coefficient A S,SV represents the attenuation of the sample in the presence of the sample plus vessel, A V ,SV the attenuation of the vessel in the presence of the sample plus vessel, and A V ,V the presence of the vessel in the presence of the vessel.The average scattering is given by
## (s4) Advantages
(p4.0) High energy X-rays or "hard" rays typically have energies of 60 keV-150 keV, about one order of magnitude higher than conventional X-rays [39].The main advantages of conducting these experiments on liquids and glasses using high energy photons include the following.

(p4.1) (i) High-momentum transfers can be accessed, leading to high-real space resolution at short distances in the pair distribution function.This can aid in accurately distinguishing between two average bond distances which are very close together, for example.

(p4.2) (ii) The high penetration allows experiments to be conducted in air and in transmission geometry, in which the scattering is concentrated in the forward direction with minimal polarization effects.This allows the use of a variety of sophisticated sample environments and a straightforward detector arrangement.
## (s7) Data Interpretation
(p7.0) The most common way of interpreting total scattering data is to use the Faber-Ziman formalism [251] which defines element specific partial structure factors.Other formalisms are occasionally used in the literature by various groups and have been summarized by Keen [252].There are also several different variations for representing the Faber-Ziman partial structure factors and partial pair distribution functions, used by different communities to highlight different aspects of the patterns.Here we describe the Hannon-Howells-Soper  formalism [252] commonly used for liquids and glasses where for X-rays,
