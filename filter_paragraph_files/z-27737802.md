## (s5) Inhibition of Invasion and Metastasis
(p5.0) In advanced cases of breast cancer tumor cells usually metastasize to bone (commonest site), liver and lung.Bone complications include pathological fractures and spinal cord compression following vertebral body collapse.The ability of cancer to invade local tissues and metastasise to distant organs has been shown to be counteracted by statins via inhibition of the specific cell signaling pathways.

(p5.1) Denoyelle et al. [42] suggested that the statin cerivastatin inhibited invasion and metastasis in the aggressive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 by preventing the synthesis of cholesterol precursor FPP and GGPP which respectively translocate Ras and Rho to the cell membrane and thus prevent cell proliferation and migration.Also, signal transduction involved in various cellular processes is regulated by Ras and RhoA, including cell motility.Absence of RhoA from the cell membrane following its delocalization to the cytosol causes actin fibers to be disorganized and focal adhesion sites to disappear.GGPP but not FPP reversed inhibition of invasion and metastasis produced by RhoA inactivation.Moreover, the authors showed that cerivastatin inactivated NFκB in a RhoA inhibition-dependent manner, resulting in a decrease in urokinase and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expressions, which are important for cell migration.

(p5.2) Alonso et al. [43] investigated the effect of lovastatin on the F3II sarcomatoid mammary carcinoma, a highly invasive and metastatic murine tumor model.They showed that lovastatin prevented tumor cell attachment and migration in vitro while in vivo it significantly increased the time for tumors to appear and reduced tumor formation and metastatic dissemination to the lungs from established mammary tumors.Addition of mevalonate but not equivalent concentrations of FPP blocked these actions thus confirming the role of statins.

(p5.3) In the subtopic of prevention of cancer invasion and metastasis it is worth mentioning the work by Rachner et al. [44] which reveals the potential role of statins in the management of metastatic bone lesions in breast cancer.Biphosphonates like zoledronic acid are licensed to treat bone metastasis in breast cancer.The authors showed that both atorvastatin and zoledronic acid effectively inhibit the Wnt inhibitor DKK-1 in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and T47D and inhibit WNT3A induced OPG (a potent inhibitor of osteoclast activity) production in osteoblasts in vitro and inhibit osteoblast differentiation.However lower concentrations of atorvastatin than zoledronic acid was sufficient to suppress DKK-1 by the same proportion.More recently Gobel et al. [45] suggested that even lower concentration of statin and zoledronic acid significantly suppressed DKK-1 if both the drugs are used together, with simvastatin being most potent statin.In the triple negative MDA-MB-231cells each drug potentiated each other as far as their DKK-1 suppressing activity was concerned.In hormone-negative and highly osteotropic breast cancer cell lines, there is significant expression of DKK-1 which does not depend on tumor grade or stage.In triple-negative breast cancer, which is associated with an unfavourable outcome and high risk of recurrence, high levels of DKK-1 is a negative prognostic marker [46].Breast cancer patients with metastatic bone lesions usually show increased DKK-1 levels [47].Thus statins may prove to be a more effective alternative than biphosphonates when used alone or in combination in preventing bone resorption by bone metastases from breast cancer.
## (s6) Beneficial Role of Statins in Radiotherapy
(p6.0) The role of ionizing radiation (IR) in cancer treatment is to kill cancer cells at the site of the tumor and its vicinity where the probability of microscopic spread is highest.Statins may be useful in radiotherapy by exerting radiosensitizing effects [48] [49].One of the factors influencing the sensitivity of cells to ionizing radiation is the phase of the cell cycle in which they are [50] [51].Cells located in late G1 and G2-M phases of the cell cycle are most sensitive to ionizing radiation-induced cell death, whereas cells located in the S phase are the most resistant.Since HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors arrest cells in late G1 phase, they sensitize cancer cells to radiotherapy.

(p6.1) Co-administration of statins with radiation may be particularly useful to reduce local recurrence rate among patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC).Lacerda et al. [52] did both an in vitro study and a retrospective clinical study to support this association.They reported that simvastatin promoted radiosensitization of cancer stem cells of IBC and non-IBC triple-negative cell lines but it radioprotects stem cells of non-IBC cell lines.In their clinical study, among the 519 IBC patients treated with postmastectomy radiation (PMRT), 53 used a statin.In statin users there was a higher local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and thus better local control.

(p6.2) According to some studies radiation therapy effects may be paradoxical because if on one hand it kills most of the cells in the primary tumor on the other hand it increases the metastatic potential of surviving tumor cells.The mechanism involved in the pro-metastatic trans-effect of IR is likely to be its effect on endothelial cells which promote the extravasation of circulating tumor cells.Hamalukic et al. [48] thus recommended the concomittent use of statins and radiation therapy to prevent this adverse effect of ionizing radiation after showing that pre administration of lovastatin antagonized the IR stimulated extravasation and metastasis.When human endothelial cells (EC), tumor cells (TC) (MCF-7 and T47D mammary carcinoma cells) or both were exposed to IR this increased TC-EC adhesion in vitro.However IR-stimulated TC-EC adhesion was blocked by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor which decreases TC-EC interaction both in vitro by inhibiting activation of NFkB and the blocking of the Rac1-regulated and NF-kB-dependent expression of E-selectin following TNFa or IR exposure of endothelial cells [53] [54].The results were confirmed in vivo [55].Moreover, radiotherapy induces inflammation and subsequent fibrosis in normal tissue as acute or delayed side effect and statins decrease the normal tissue damage [55]- [58].Lovastatin had the same anti-metastatic effect whether it was given before or after radiation treatment.Thus we can use lovastatin before radiotherapy to prevent its pro-metastatic effect and continue its use after radiotherapy for an extended period of time to help normal tissue healing without adversely affecting metastasis.
## (s8) Statins as Effective Neoadjuvant Therapy
(p8.0) The work by Garwood et al. [27] shows promise regarding the use of statins as neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer.They tried to find whether patients with in situ and invasive breast cancer could benefit from taking lipophilic statins on a short-term basis.Women with a diagnosis of DCIS or stage 1 breast cancer who were due for surgery were treated with fluvastatin.Patients were randomly given high dose (80 mg/day) or low dose (20 mg/day) fluvastatin for 3 -6 weeks before surgery.Tissue (diagnostic core biopsy/final surgical specimen), blood, and magnetic resonance images before treatment were compared with those after treatment.Anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic actions of statins (determined by Ki-67 and CC3 respectively) was more significant in high grade tumors than in low grade tumors.On the other hand, MRI showed that the median tumor volume after treatment decreased by 12.7% which was not statistically significant.Nevertheless the results are promising because they provide clinical evidence that statins could be the answer to the treatment of resistant ER-negative high grade breast cancers.It provides solid ground for further research on the effect of other statins for different treatment times which may have better outcome on tumor shrinkage.Similarly Bjarnadottir et al. [26] investigated the effects of statins in neoadjuvant setting and tried to clarify the relationship between statins and their effects on tumor proliferation and HMGCR expression.They tried to see whether HMGCR expression could be used as a tool to predict whether a breast cancer could show beneficial response if treated with a statin as a neo adjuvant treatment.High-dose atorvastatin (80 mg/day) was prescribed to 50 patients with primary invasive breast cancer 2 weeks before surgery.Ki67 and HMGCR immunohistochemical expression was compared in paired samples before and after statin treatment.They concluded that atorvastatin treatment significantly up-regulated HMGCR in 68% of the paired samples with evaluable HMGCR expression.Anti-proliferative action of atorvastatin was not significant in the paired samples but significant in tumors expressing HMGCR in the pre-treatment sample.Furthermore, post-treatment Ki67 expression and HMGCR expression showed an inverse correlation (rs = −0.42;P = 0.03).Thus patients with breast cancers expressing HMGCR appear to be ideal candidates for statin neoadjuvant therapy in whom statins are more likely to decrease proliferation.Nevertheless it is important to point out that HMGCR expression is associated with smaller tumour diameter, lower histologic grade, ERα and ERβ expression, and lower baseline proliferation rate [66].
## (s9) Statins May Reduce Breast Cancer Mortality
(p9.0) Murtola et al. [67] conducted a cohort study in Finland involving 31,236 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry over the period 1995-2003 and followed them for a median 3.25 years after the diagnosis.They concluded that those patients who used statins were at lesser at risk to die from their disease.Neither the stage of the disease (localized or metastatic breast cancer) nor the time at which statin use was started (before or after breast cancer diagnosis) seemed to affect the beneficial role of statins.In addition the lowered risk correlated with the dose of statin use especially for pre-diagnostic usage.Differences in age, tumor characteristics and treatment selection between statin users and non-users did not alter the risk decrease.Other antilipidaemic drugs like fibrates did not possess the protective effect when given to patients of similar age, tumor and treatment characteristics.Competing causes of death or the likelihood that patient could decrease statin usage at the end of life did not seem to undermine the decreased risk observed.Major strengths of this study include the large number of patients and detailed knowledge on timing, dosage and duration of statin use.

(p9.1) Cardwell et al. [68] tried to determine the relationship between patients taking statins after they were diagnosed with breast cancer and whether this affected cancer-specific or all-cause mortality.Data was taken from a cohort of 17,880 breast cancer patients newly diagnosed between 1998 and 2009 using data from English cancer registries.Their results suggested statins decreased mortality due to breast cancer (fully adjusted HR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.68 -1.04) and all causes (HR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72 -0.97).These associations were more marked for simvastatin (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.63 -1.00) and (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.70 -0.95) respectively.Unfortunately the results may be misleading because of the weakness of the associations involved and attenuation seen in some sensitivity analyses.

(p9.2) More recently Zhong et al. [69] conducted a meta-analysis which concluded that patients who used statins both before and after their cancer was diagnosed survived longer.There was a decrease in both cancer and non-cancer specific mortality in colorectal, prostate and breast cancer.In breast cancer they concluded a HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.62 -0.86.Limitations of the study included outcome other than mortality (all-cause and cancer specific) for example cancer recurrence, low statistical power of subgroups due to smaller number of patients, failure to analyze those patients who were on statin before cancer diagnosis and who continued using statins, failure to consider unmeasured factors related to statin and immortal time bias in the included studies.
## (s11) Statins Are Cost Effective Drugs
(p11.0) Treating cancer patients involves a lot of costs.Patients not only have to pay for the drugs but also laboratory tests, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, imaging tests, radiotherapy, hospitalization and surgery.Although cancer drugs are effective the fact that they are expensive makes it a deterrent to treatment.Indeed 11 of the new cancer drugs approved in 2012 were priced above $100,000 annually and 20% -30% copayment can make them unaffordable even for well-insured patients.In many cases patients stop treatment while in some cases treatment is not started.This leads to complications in the patient, management of which may be more difficult and costlier.To make things worse health insurance companies are unwilling to reimburse a significant portion of the expenses.Statins have the potential to lower the cost of breast cancer management and allow patients to get quality cancer care at an affordable price.There is a big variation in the price of statins depending on the setting but low-intensity generic statins are now widely available from discount retailers which hence makes the drug more accessible.In one study the authors assumed universal access to statins at $4 per month in an attempt to determine the cost-effectiveness of cheap statin generics in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease [73].
## (s13) Meta-Analyses Reveal No Relationship between Statins and Breast Cancer Incidence
(p13.0) Since randomized statin trials did not have breast cancer incidence as the primary endpoint [74], epidemiologists have used observational and experimental studies to conduct meta-analyses.Unfortunately they have shown no relationship between statin use and breast cancer risk.Table 2 summarises the results of some of these studies.Among these the studies by Bonovas and Undela focused on breast cancer specifically while others focused on cancers in general including breast cancer.Randomised clinical trials are essential to determine the chemopreventive potential of statins and whether they are superior to tamoxifen which at present is the only drug licensed as a chemopreventive agent for women at high risk for breast cancer (women more than 35 years and with a 5-year predicted risk of breast cancer equal to or more than 1.67% according to the Gail model).
## (s14) Potential Carcinogenicity of Statins
(p14.0) With statins being the most commonly prescribed drug in the world, we must ensure they are safe both on short and long term bases.There are mixed opinions regarding the potential of statins to cause cancer.

(p14.1) According to the meta analysis conducted by Bjerre et al. [81], statins did not seem to increase the risk of fatal and non fatal cancers over a 5 year period.Another meta analysis by Hebert et al. [82] involved 16 individual trials with 29000 patients with an average follow up of 3.3 years concluded that neither non-CVD deaths nor cancer incidence were significantly increased.The meta-analysis by Law et al. [83] showed no evidence that a low serum cholesterol significantly increased cancer mortality but it did increase the risk of haemorrhagic stroke.The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) followed patients on a period of 8 years to see the protective role of statins in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.Again there was no decrease in overall mortality (relative risk, 0.70; P 0.00002) with no significant difference in cancer deaths (relative risk, 0.73; P 0.087).
