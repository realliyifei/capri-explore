## (s2) 2.
(p2.0) We see from (2.12) that m CUE l is independent of N for all |l| < N. Closely related to this is the fact that the distribution of |Tr U k | 2 = | ∑ N j=1 e ix j k | 2 , for k a positive integer less than or equal to N, is such that its first N moments coincide with the corresponding moments of √ k times a standard complex Gaussian random variable for k ≤ N [105], [52].
## (s3) 2.
(p3.0) In the case F L = G L (2.44) specifies the large L form of the bulk scaled variance of the linear statistic ∑ N l=1 F L (X l ). It was established by Soshnikov [150] that the distribution of the centred linear statistic ∑ N l=1 F L (X l ) − L ∞ −∞ F(X) dX converges to a zero mean Gaussian with this bulk scaled variance; see also [35].

(p3.1) In the case of the bulk scaling of Gaudin's deformation of the CUE as specified by the probability density function (PDF) (2.29), taking the place of (2.41) is the functional form [90] (2.51) lim

(p3.2) where ν = − log(e 2πa − 1). Changing variables ω/a = ω , we note that for a → ∞ only the integration region from ω = −2π to 0 contributes, and (2.41) is reclaimed. It was shown in [90] that the Fourier transform of (2.51) can be computed explicity. Forming from this the structure function (recall the definition in (2.42)) gives
## (s4) 2.
(p4.0) The structure function taking a non-zero value at k = 0 is in (2.53) is also a feature of the statistics of the real eigenvalues in the ensemble of N × N real Gaussian matrices. For such matrices the eigenvalues occur in complex conjugate pairs and moreover there are O( √ N) real eigenvalues which to leading order have uniform density in the interval (− √ N, √ N) [67]. Results from [84], [32] give that in the bulk scaled limit the truncated two-point correlation has the explicit form
## (s6) For
(p6.0) This linear statistic has a property analogous to that of |Tr U k | 2 for U ∈ CUE noted in Remark 2.3.2. Thus the first N/2 moments coincide with those of √ k times a standard real Gaussian random variable [52], a fact which is related to the RHS of (2.66) being independent of N for all non-negative integers p, q ≤ N/2. 
## (s9) 2.10.2.
(p9.0) Consistency with log-gas predictions. The log-gas analogy for the eigenvalue PDF for the circular β ensemble (2.90) leads to predictions for both the smoothed bulk and global scaled forms of the quantity C (2),N (x, x ), as required for the determination of the corresponding fluctuation formulas [20,102,70]. The fluctuation formulas obtained using this heuristic are consistent with the exact results obtained in the case of the circular β ensemble and moreover the working can be extended to apply to other random matrix ensembles. This is possible because of log-gas analogies for those random matrix ensembles too.

(p9.1) When the eigenvalue PDF permits a Bolzmann factor interpretation e −βU , it is possible to take the viewpoint that a linear statistic U u := ∑ N j=1 u(x j ) is a perturbing external one body potential, so that the perturbed Boltzmann factor becomes e −β(U u +U) . Expanding the factor e −βU u to first order in u, e −βU u ≈ 1 − β ∑ N j=1 u(x j ) we can check from the definitions that

(p9.2) where C (2),N (x, x ) is the quantity (2.11) computed in the absence of U u and n (1),N (x ) := ∑ N j=1 δ(x − x j ). The key hypothesis is that for large N, the LHS of (2.112) is determined by the macroscopic electrostatics implied by the pair potential φ(z, z ) in (2.91), and thus satisfies the integral equation
## (s12) Recalling (2.21), it follows
(p12.0) as is consistent with (3.2). We note too that in the limit N → ∞ the second characteristic function in (3.36) becomes a Gaussian like the first upon the recentringP N, f =x 2 (t) →

(p12.1) That the rescaled limiting distribution of the polynomial linear statistics ∑ N j=1 x k j (k ∈ Z + ) is a Gaussian with variance as implied by (3.2) was first established by Johansson [106]. In [33] this result was extended to a wider class of linear statistics using a loop equation analysis; see also [21], [114] and [34].
## (s16) 2.
(p16.0) A loop equation analysis has been applied to various discretisation of the classical βensembles [31,54]. In the so-called one cut regime, the universal form of W 2,0 as given by the RHS of (3.36) is recovered.

(p16.1) 3. All convex potentials V(x) in (3.3) are known to lead to a one cut regime for the corresponding eigenvalue density. However, without this assumption, the eigenvalue density may consist of several intervals and the fluctuation formula for a linear statistic typically involves quasi-periodic terms [145].
