(p4.0) It was soon realized that in contrast to the Co(II) mediated hydrolysis of C−S bonds, Mn(II) and Zn(II) (in the presence of N-Et-HPTB 1− ligand) could not mediate the hydrolysis of thiolates and instead allowed only the isolation of binuclear Mn(II)/Zn(II)-thiolate complexes. 122,123Interestingly, Fe(II) could replicate the chemistry described in Scheme 3 for Co(II) and thus the reaction of Fe(BF 4 ) 2 •6H 2 O, HN-Et-HPTB and Et 3 N with either R 2 SH (R 2 = t Bu, CH 2 Ph) or NaS t Bu in DMF produced a binuclear Fe(II)-hydrosulfide complex, [Fe 2 (N-Et-HPTB)(SH)(H 2 O)](BF 4 ) 2 (3(BF 4 ) 2 ) (confirmed by singlecrystal X-ray structure determination) and the alcohols, R 2 OH (identified and quantified by GC-MS). 124Compound 3(BF 4 ) 2 was isostructural with 2a(BF 4 ) 2 and could also be synthesized by the reaction of a preformed diiron(II)-solvento compound, [Fe 2 (N-Et-HPTB)(DMF) 4 ](BF 4 ) 3 (4(BF 4 ) 3 ), similar to 1a(BF 4 ) 3 , with NaS t Bu in the presence of Et 3 N in DMF.The yields of 3(BF 4 ) 2 (71−75% for R 2 = t Bu and 33% for R 2 = CH 2 Ph) were also comparable with the yields of the corresponding alcohols ( t BuOH, 82%; PhCH 2 OH, 26%) and thus indicated a clean stoichiometric reaction.The results obtained with Fe(II) mediated hydrolysis of aliphatic thiolates therefore indicated that a mechanism identical or very similar to that proposed in Scheme 3 for the Co(II) mediated reaction might be operative.However, neither Co(II) nor Fe(II) could mediate the hydrolysis of aromatic thiolates (in the presence of N-Et-HPTB 1− ), C−S bonds of which are comparatively more difficult to cleave than those of aliphatic thiolates.Therefore, we planned to explore the newly developed reaction with Co(II) and Fe(II) in different binucleating ligands in order to expand the substrate scope, isolate the intermediate (I), and get more information regarding this hydrolysis reaction.
## (s6) Consecutive Cleavage of C−S and S−S Bonds in Disulfides
(p6.0) Having established the hydrolysis of thiolates in the presence of PhBIMP 1− ligand to be the most efficient process among the four reaction systems using four different binucleating ligands (Schemes 3 and 4), we went forward to expand the scope of this reaction with disulfides.−9 It may, however, be noted that the complete desulfurization of disulfides (R-S-S-R) would require the cleavage of two C−S bonds and one S−S bond, of which the former may involve a hydrolysis reaction to generate 2 equiv of alcohol/phenol while the latter may involve a 2 electron redox process involving the Co(II) or Fe(II) centers (Scheme 7).Incomplete desulfurization processes involving the simultaneous cleavage of C−S and S−S bonds of bis(trifluoromethyl)trisulfide by the use of Grignard reagents 129,130 and organolithium reagents 131,132 at −78 °C were reported in the literature, while alkyl disulfides were recovered unreacted under similar reaction conditions. 130owever, there was no report available for transition metal mediated complete desulfurization of disulfides involving the cleavage of both C−S and S−S bonds.Addition of Co(BF 4 ) 2 • 6H 2 O into a mixture of HPhBIMP and a series of disulfides (RS-SR: R = Me, t Bu, CH 2 Ph, CH 2 (CH 2 ) 10 CH 3 ) in DMF at RT allowed the isolation of 6a(BF 4 ) 2 in 41−52% yields while the corresponding alcohols/phenols were obtained in 54− 100% yields (ratios of the yields of 6a(BF 4 ) 2 and alcohols were ∼1:2, as expected). 133The cleavage of a S−S bond, however, would involve a 2 electron redox process and hence would require the generation of a dicobalt(III) species during the reaction (Scheme 7).Indeed, mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction solution for all of the desulfurization reactions involving different disulfides showed the generation of a common species, [Co III 2 (PhBIMP)(H 2 O) 2 (DMF) 2 ] 5+ (6e) in each case.Generation of such a species was never observed during the Co(II) mediated hydrolysis of thiolates and diphenyl sulfide, where only the hydrolysis reaction was involved. 125In line with this, the Co(II) mediated complete desulfurization of diacetyl disulfide and dibenzoyl disulfide would therefore generate 6a(BF 4 ) 2 , 6e, and the corresponding carboxylic acids (instead of alcohols), which in turn might replace the bridging hydrosulfide in 6a(BF 4 ) 2 to generate carboxylate bridged dicobalt(II) complexes.Indeed, generation of 6a(BF 4 ) 2 and the carboxylate bridged dicobalt(II) complexes, [Co 2 (PhBIMP)(RCOO)(MeCN)] 2+ (R = Me, 6f; Ph, 6g), were confirmed by a combination of single-crystal X-ray structure determination and mass spectrometry, while the generation of 6e in the reaction solution was again observed by mass spectrometry.Very similar observations were noted for Fe(II) mediated complete desulfurization of disulfides (RS-SR: R = Me, t Bu, CH 2 Ph, CH 2 (CH 2 ) 10 CH 3 ) which again allowed the isolation of 8a(BF 4 ) 2 and the corresponding alcohols in ∼1:2 ratio of yields.However, the yields of 8a(BF 4 ) 2 were found to be much lower (20−36%) compared with that obtained for 6a(BF 4 ) 2 (41−52%), thus indicating that the Co(II) mediated process is more efficient than the Fe(II) mediated one.Generation of a diiron(III) species with the apparent formulation [Fe III 2 (PhBIMP)-(H 2 O) 2 (DMF) 2 ] 5+ (8d) was again observed by mass spectrometry, and its identity (Scheme 7) was further confirmed by comparing with the mass spectrometric and electronic absorption spectroscopic data for that of an authentic sample (independently synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electronic absorption spectroscopy).On the other hand, Fe(II) mediated complete desulfurization of diacetyl disulfide and dibenzoyl disulfide allowed the generation of 8a(BF 4 ) 2 , [Fe 2 (PhBIMP)(RCOO)(MeCN)] 2+ (R = Me, 8e; Ph, 8f) and 8d and were confirmed for the first two species by a combination of single-crystal X-ray structure determination and mass spectrometry while the generation of 8d was again identified by mass spectrometry.Interestingly, the reaction systems involving HPhBIMP and either Co(II) or Fe(II) could also desulfurize elemental sulfur (S 8 ) to yield 6a(BF 4 ) 2 and 8a(BF 4 ) 2 in 53% and 22% yields, respectively, while the generation of S
## (s7) Catalytic Hydrolysis of Thiolates
(p7.0) After the successful demonstration of first-row transition metal (Fe II , Co II , Ni II , Zn II ) mediated hydrolysis of a series of thiolate and other organosulfur substrates, isolation, and characterization of the all the species involved in the reaction, we planned to upgrade this reaction from a stoichiometric reaction to a catalytic one.A careful analysis of the molecular structures of the dicobalt(II)-hydrosulfide complex, 6a (and its isostructural iron analogue, 8a), revealed that (i) one of the two Co(II) centers (Co1) was five-coordinated (Scheme 8) thereby offering an available coordination site, (ii) the metal− ligand bond might not be strong enough to yield a stable dicobalt(II) complex with six-coordination at both the cobalt centers, and (iii) the hydrosulfide bridged the two Co(II) centers in an unsymmetrical manner with very different Co− SH distances of 2.644( 1 ) remained nearly invariable.Therefore, we went forward to explore the catalytic hydrolysis of C−S bonds for a series of thiolates with the following optimum conditions: (i) thiolate:H 2 O = 1:16, (ii) catalyst (6a): aliphatic thiolate = 1:5, catalyst (6a):aromatic thiolate = 1:3, and (iii) reaction time = 30 h (aliphatic thiolates), 120 h (aromatic thiolates).It was also found that the catalytic hydrolysis of thiolates was not favorable under acidic conditions, while the use of a base, such as Et 3 N, did not improve the results.Catalytic hydrolysis of a total of 11 substrates (Scheme 8) was explored at RT, 136 and the results (Table 2) showed that the catalysis was comparatively more efficient for aliphatic thiolates (yield of alcohols = 81−90%) than that for the aromatic thiolates (yield of phenols = 31−52%), which, however, was consistent with our previous reports on stoichiometric hydrolysis of thiolates 125 and the reported level of difficulty (alkyl  by mass spectrometry of the reaction solutions.Thus, the presence of excess thiolate and H 2 O triggered the decomposition of 6a and/or I 6a , which ultimately caused the TONs to be low.Nevertheless, this work 136 remains the first and so far the only example of a firstrow transition metal catalyzed hydrolysis of aliphatic and aromatic thiolates at ambient conditions and without the involvement of any additional reagents or cocatalysts.
