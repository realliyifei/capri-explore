## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by a symptomatology based on persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that has been considered a progressively ceaseless condition [1]. The ADHD symptomatology interferes with subject function and development according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria [2] impairing daily function [3,4]. Moreover, ADHD is commonly associated with other comorbid diseases (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, etc.) [5], and in adult age it is a risk factor for various mental disorders [6,7]. Therefore, ADHD is a significant burden for the affected youngsters, adults, their families and society everywhere.
## (s5) Environmental Factors
(p5.0) The estimated involvement of environmental factors in ADHD pathogenesis is around 20-30% [64], highlighting prenatal, perinatal and postnatal difficulties, psychological adversities, exposure to chemical contaminants, or iron deficiency as factors that increase the probability of developing ADHD [54]; predisposing environmental factors increase the risk of developing ADHD based on a genetically or biologically determined vulnerability pattern.
## (s9) Serotonin (5-HT) Imbalance
(p9.0) The imbalance of excitatory serotonin function has also been related to ADHD development [89,90]. Serotonin dysfunction plays a mediator role in ADHD-related hyperactive and impulsive behaviours [91] inducing impaired control of impulses, violent behaviour, concentration and appetite [89]. Moreover, serotonin regulates DA activity through its receptors 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (5-HTR1B) or 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (5-HTR2A). The dysfunction of these receptors can lead to problems of serotonin-DA dynamics, resulting in ADHD symptoms [89,90]. In addition, other proteins related to 5-HT metabolism, such as tryptophan 5-hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and nitrous oxide synthase 1 (NOS-1), which reduces the serotonin transporter (SERT or SLC6A4) cell surface localization increasing the levels of extracellular serotonin, might be involved in the pathophysiology of ADHD [90,92].
## (s12) Altered Neural Viability and Neurodegeneration
(p12.0) Neuronal network morphogenesis is based on an effective equilibrium between neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration, as well as the formation of new cells through proliferation/survival signalling and cytoskeletal structures [120]. ADHD seems to present a morphogenesis dysregulation [92,121], with a high number of neurophysiological difficulties caused by neuronal network dysfunctions in the brain. It has been observed that the inability to modulate neural connections can promote a reduction of brain volumes and inefficient neural networks [92]. These impairments might be the result of neurodegeneration, neurogenesis problems, altered proliferation-differentiation balance, deficient neurotrophic factors and, thereby, loss of neuronal viability [92]. Besides, oxidative stress results in a notable problem in terms of neuronal damage which can lead to all of the defects mentioned above [92].

(p12.1) There are several proteins and molecular processes involved in neuronal survival, including trophic factors, NTs or neuronal function regulators. One such protein involved is BDNF, which stimulates neuronal development and maintenance, regulates NT function and contributes in neuronal plasticity processes, such as long-term potentiation and learning [122]. BDNF dysregulation is associated with ADHD. Neurotrophin-3 (NTF-3) has been also related to neuron survival [92]. Furthermore, it has been reported that NTF-3 promotes bone marrow neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation into cholinergic neurons [123]. Glutamate and some of its receptors are also involved in neurogenesis and proliferation [92]. Alterations in glutamate receptors (GRM-1, GRM-5, GRM-7 and GRM-8) have been associated with ADHD [124]. Other proteins related to proliferation and neurodevelopment that are altered in ADHD are cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), cyclin D1 and NOS-1, cadherin-13 (CADH13) and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin (PARK2) [92].
## (s17) Drug Molecular Targets and Drug-Induced Molecular Changes
(p17.0) LDX has been reported to modulate with pharmacological action of seven human protein targets ( Table 2). On the one hand, it acts as activator of TAAR1. On the other hand, six protein targets are inhibited by LDX: synaptic vesicular amine transporter (SLC18A2), DAT (SLC6A3), NET (SLC6A2), SERT (SLC6A4) and amine oxidase [flavin-containing] (MAO) A and B [153][154][155][156][157]. All of these targets are involved in the presynaptic signalling, and LDX therefore has a role in regulating three main NT pathways: DA, NE and serotonin. Moreover, LDX has a role as a neuromaintenance agent since it inhibits MAOA and MAOB oxidative enzymes (Fig. 2).
## (s18) MPH vs LDX: Similarities and Differences
(p18.0) Similarities MPH and LDH have similar targets and act in the same way: both promote the inhibition of DAT and NET [153,156,157]. Regarding the indirect drug-induced molecular changes, both drugs promote the activation of DRD1, DRD5, ADRA2A and ADRA2B, then modulate the dopaminergic and adrenergic signalling, therefore regulating the reuptake and release of catecholamines (primarily NE and DA) on the synaptic cleft [131,153].

(p18.1) Likewise, TNF is indirectly activated by both drugs, which implies a potential immunomodulatory role for MPH and LDX. Although the role of the effect of both drugs on TNF is unknown, it has been reported that TNFa promotes astrocyte activation [161]. In an ADHD comorbid disease, major depressive disorder, activated astrocytes can reduce glutamate on the synaptic cleft via excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) and convert it to glutamine in the cytosol [162]. In this sense, higher glutamate levels have been observed in children with ADHD [101]. Then the activation of TNF could improve the synaptic signalling. On the other hand, in vitro studies carried out in astrocytes have shown that cytokines such as TNF, among others, support the production of neuroprotective mediators [163]. More studies are necessary to understand the role of the effect of both drugs on TNF in ADHD.
## (s22) MPH
(p22.0) MPH exerts its action promoting the downregulation of DA and NE transporter (DAT and NET) (protein targets) [139]. This leads to an increase of DA and NE levels in the prefrontal cortex (synaptic cleft) that control hyperactivity and deficits in inhibitory behaviour (improvement in attentional deficit and cognitive functioning) [139,171]. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying their action are poorly understood. The interaction of MPH with several proteins involved in the neurotransmission process could explain its MoA (Fig. 3).
## (s23) Regulation of Presynaptic
(p23.0) Receptors DA accumulation after MPH blockade of DAT induces disinhibition (upregulation) of the presynaptic receptor DRD2 (dopaminergic neuron) and activates D1 receptors on the postsynaptic neuron that uptake DA, continuing the neuronal transmission and therefore improving attention, focus and organized thoughts and actions [172,173].
## (s24) Regulation of Postsynaptic Receptors
(p24.0) In PFC neurons, MPH indirectly activates the postsynaptic DRD1 and DRD5 [142] that uptake DA and transmit the signal in postsynaptic neurons [175]. The stimulation of these receptors probably leads to the GRIA1 receptor phosphorylation promoted by MPH, as described by Pascoli et al. [143].

(p24.1) MPH also upregulates ADRA2A, ADRA2B and ADRD1B receptors located in postsynaptic neurons. The assessment of the effect of MPH on the two major signalling pathways (cAMPdependent protein kinase [PKA] and extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]) in PFC [143] showed no activation of ERK2 phosphorylation. However, the MPH effects on these signalling pathways were totally inhibited using ADRD1B blockers, showing that ADRD1B mediates the phosphorylation of PKA signalling through MPH in the PFC [143]. Moreover, it has been shown that MPH exerts excitatory actions on PFC neurons by activating ADRA2 [175,176]. In this sense, NE neurotransmission seemed also to be modulated via ADRA1 and ADRA2 [143].

(p24.2) LDX LDX controls the neuronal transmission, both at presynaptic (direct) and postsynaptic (indirect) levels. This results in an amplification of DA activity and an improvement in attentional deficit and cognitive functioning, as well as a reduction in hyperactivity (Fig. 3).
## (s25) Regulation of Presynaptic Receptors LDX inhibits DAT and NET transporters leading to an
(p25.0) increase in DA and NE levels in the synaptic cleft [153,156,157]. LDX can also promote the increase of DA in the synaptic cleft by activating protein TAAR1, which produces the efflux of monoamine NTs, mainly DA, from storage sites on presynaptic neurons [155,177]. TAAR1 activation leads to intracellular cAMP signalling that results in PKA and PKC phosphorylation and activation [178][179][180]. This PKC activation decreases DAT1 [181], NET1 [182] and SERT [183] cell surface expression, intensifying the direct blockage of monoamine transporters by LDX and improving the neurotransmission imbalance in ADHD. In addition, PKC might induce p38 MAPK-mediated inactivation of AKTs [184,185], proteins essential for DAT cell surface redistribution due to AKT induction of actin reorganization, regulating the dopamine efflux impaired in ADHD [186].
## (s27) MPH
(p27.0) MPH presents a pro-inflammatory profile. Several studies have exposed that the long-term use of MPH induces the DA neuron loss and microglia activation causing an increase in proinflammatory markers TNFa and IL-1b, among others, resulting in the activation of neuroinflammation and triggering a neurodegenerative process [192,193]. Therefore, their long-term use must be considered the result of loss of DA transmission and, in turn, efficacy.

(p27.1) On the other hand, the use of MPH could create dependence or abuse [194,195]. The chronic abuse of MPH also induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFa and IL-1b [148,196,197]. With MPH at 10 mg/ kg, an increase of the inflammatory markers in the amygdale has been observed [148].
## (s28) LDX
(p28.0) It is important to remark that the inflammatory profile of LDX has not been evaluated in an ADHD context. It has been assessed in ADHD comorbid disease, such as bipolar disorder in animal models [160], in which LDX increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa and IL-6, and also the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in the frontal cortex, striatum and serum [160,198]. However, a recent study did not show LDX having an effect on IL-10 (antiinflammatory cytokine, upregulated to control the inflammatory response duration and intensity) neither on TNFa nor on IL-1b (proinflammatory cytokines) [199]. On the other hand, MAOA inhibition and TAAR1 activation by LDX (both direct targets of LDX) might influence MAPK3 activation, which is crucial for the downstream modulation of a large number of proteins involved in many biological processes, such as neuroinflammation [200]. MAPK3 can induce the expression of some antiinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-2, IL-10), downregulated in patients with ADHD, via NFjB (NFKB1) activation [200][201][202].

(p28.1) Recent evidence suggests the involvement of the immune system in several psychiatric conditions [203][204][205]; one of the most studied in this respect is depression [206][207][208]. Given the role of LDX in modulating inflammatory and immunomodulatory molecules in psychiatric condition settings, a possible role of LDX in modulating the immune system in other psychiatric conditions, such as depression or ADHD, could be expected. Thus, more studies are required to understand the inflammatory profile of LDX in ADHD.
## (s29) Circadian System Dysfunction
(p29.0) MPH As previously exposed, ADHD is related to a delayed sleep-phase [116]. MPH increases the activity at mid-to-late night and leads to a delay in sleep relative to the light-dark cycle [209]; but the mechanisms of MPH involved in the circadian rhythm are unknown. One study in ADHD that investigated markers of oxidative stress and inflammation showed that MPH downregulated c-FOS (gene involved in circadian rhythm) [148]. Another study that assessed the impact of MPH on CLOCK gene protein expression showed that MPH increased c-Fos expression. Although the authors did not consider its influence on the circadian functioning of the cerebral cortex, MPH causes a widespread increase in neuronal activation throughout the region [210].

(p29.1) Other hormones involved in circadian rhythm are serotonin and melatonin [211,212]. Healthy children have higher 5-HT concentrations in the morning compared with patients with ADHD, with very similar concentrations in the evening [212]. In that study, MPH treatment induced a decrease of 5-HT levels in the evening (without changes in the morning); the effect of MPH on melatonin concentrations was a decrease in the morning and an increase in the evening, normalizing these values to those observed in the non-ADHD population [212].
## (s31) Altered Neural Viability and Neurodegeneration
(p31.0) MPH Neuronal Survival Motaghinejad et al. showed that MPH downregulates CREB1 [148], a major transcription factor in brain development and neurogenesis [215], and its product BDNF, which acts downstream in the CREB pathway signalling [148]. This mechanism observed with the use of amphetamines leads to neurodegeneration and lower cell survival [216].

(p31.1) Other proteins related to neural viability are MAPK3 and AK1, both downregulated by MPH [148]. These proteins act upstream in the CREB pathway signalling favouring CREB/BDNF phosphorylation and the activation of this signalling pathway [148].
