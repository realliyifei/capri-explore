## (s6) Physical structures
(p6.0) The surface morphology of spin-coated films is influenced by solvent evaporation during fabrication, therefore is affected by solvent properties and preparation condition.In a study of spin-coating As 33 S 67 with butylamine solutions, grain sizes of about 25 and 50nm were found on films produced by a dilute solution and such grainy pattern flattened out after thermal treatment.The author concluded that this grain structure was from the agglomeration of 1 to 4.2 nm radii clusters during solvent evaporation [26].In another example, the film properties of spin-coated Ge 23 Sb 7 S 70 films are investigated against spinning parameters such as spinspeed and wait time between applying the solution to the substrate and spin start.Increased spin speed leads to thinner films with lower surface roughness.Another important result from this study is that in order to obtain a smooth and uniform film, it is crucial to start spinning immediately after applying the volatile solution to the substrate.Otherwise, the solution on the substrates will have higher viscosity and spread out less uniformly [43].
## (s8) Spin-coated waveguide over-cladding for low-temperature roughness reduction
(p8.0) Annealing is a common fabrication step to smooth out the surface roughness of chalcogenide structures, and it can be the key to reduce optical loss.However, some chalcogenides such as Ge-Sb-S are thermally less stable and prone to surface crystallization, which make them unsuitable for high-temperature annealing.To overcome this problem, the solution process can be used to deposit a arsenic sulfide over-cladding structure and achieve roughness reduction at sub-T g annealing .

(p8.1) Carlie et al. demonstrated such surface roughness reduction in evaporated Ge-Sb-S structures while achieving optimization in refractive index, density and optical losses.Rib waveguides are first fabricated with Ge-Sb-S, onto which a 25mg/ml As-S solution is spincoated and act as a waveguide over-cladding structure (Fig. 4).After heat treatment, the surface roughness is reduced from 50nm to ~5nm and the sidewall roughness is reduced from 19nm to 1.4nm.The optical loss measured at 1550nm also becomes smaller after spin-coating [44].
## (s9) Thick film deposition and multilayer structures
(p9.0) Another advantage of the solution process over other conventional fabrication methods is the ability to deposit thick films.Such structures have technological importance in a number of applications, including data storage, plasmonics or high contrast photodarkening and photodoping in optoelectronics.

(p9.1) In a recent study, Zha et al. demonstrated 4µm single film deposition by spin-coating and over 10µm multilayer structures [40].Single layers are first deposited on salt substrates which can be entirely dissolved in water to give free-standing chalcogenide films.Multilayer structures are achieved by laminating these layers onto a spin-coated base film.The entire construct then undergoes an annealing step to remove liquid and any interfaces between the layers (Fig. 5).Homogeneous thick structures are fabricated using the same chalcogenide material, while heterogeneous multilayer structures can be created with layers of different solution-processed chalcogenides, or vacuum-coated metals.Photo-enhanced silver diffusion and refractive index increase over 0.2 are shown in the Ag-As 2 S 3 multilayer structures [40].
