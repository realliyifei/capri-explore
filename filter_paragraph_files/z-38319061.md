## (s0) INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease of the Caucasian population world wide, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 3000 live births [1] .This multisystem disorder is characteri sed by irreversible lung destruction, gastrointestinal malfunction and exocrine insufficiency.Respiratory disease remains the most relevant source of morbidity and mortality, and accounts for over 80% of deaths [2] .Consequently, thoracic imaging plays a pivotal role in monitoring disease complications and progression.

(p0.1) Computed tomography (CT) in particular has been increasingly used to evaluate CF patients.Over the last 15 years there has been almost a 6fold increase in the use of CT scanning in CF [3] .This trend can be attributed to the widespread availability of CT, rapid acquisition time and the high sensitivity and specificity for lung and gastrointestinal disease.However, there are growing concerns over repeated patient exposure to ionising radiation and the potential carcinogenic consequences.With the everincreasing life expectancy of CF patients and a predilection for certain cancers, cumulative radiation exposure from radiological imaging is receiving increasing scrutiny [4,5] .This review explores the current imaging trends in CF with particular emphasis on new developments in dose optimisation.
## (s1) CT USE AND CUMULATIVE EFFECTIVE DOSE
(p1.0) During their lifetime, it is estimated that CF patients will have on average 3.2 thoracic CT scans (range 013) [6] , which results in cumulative effective doses (CEDs) in excess of the general population.There are many rea sons for this including the length of time patients suffer from the disease and the accuracy of CT in the setting of CF.Thoracic imaging often begins during infancy; as the earliest radiological manifestation of CF, mucous plugging, can be detected using radiological imaging.As the illness progresses, scanning is often required to assess deteriorating lung structure and function caused by chronic infection and inflammation secondary to bronchiectasis.
## (s4) OPTIMISATION OF CT PARAMETERS
(p4.0) There is major industry and clinical impetus to develop and implement strategies that will reduce the effective doses incurred by patients undergoing CT without sacrificing diagnostic capabilities.The balance between image quality and radiation dose is particularly important where dose reduction is contemplated.Image noise is inversely related to Xray beam energy and is an important determinant of image quality [52] .There are several scanning parameters that affect the radiation dose associated with CT, namely: Tube current, tube voltage, scanning length, collimation, table speed, table
## (s7) IR
(p7.0) As we have already explored in this review, increased image noise and reduced image quality are potential unfortunate consequences of reducing CT radiation dose.Standard CT scanners use filtered back projection (FBP) for image reconstruction.However, newer algorithms using IR have been introduced to reconstruct image data using a system of models which improve image noise.IR uses raw data as a building block whereby it transforms the measured value of each pixel to a new ideal estimate for that pixel [74] .This method uses matrix algebra and is repeated until the final estimated and ideal pixel values ultimately converge [75] .The use of IR extracts noise from CT images acquired at reduced exposure preserving image quality and interpretability [76] .The main advantage is that IR allows significant reductions in radiation dose while maintaining satisfactory image quality when compared to traditional FBP [74,77] .Hybrid IR, which combines both IR and FBP in a predefined ratio for image reconstruction, has been well validated in coronary CT angiography and for low dose CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis in chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease [78] .Multiple commercially available hybrid IR packages are available these include adaptive statistical iter ative reconstruction (ASIR) (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, United States), adaptive iterative dose reduction (AIDR) (Toshiba Medical Systems, Tochigi, Japan), image reconstruction in image space (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), sinogram affirmed IR (Siemens Healthcare) and iDose (Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands).Craig et al [30] compared hybrid IR of lowdose CT abdomenpelvis datasets with conventionaldose CT in Crohn's disease and reported a 74% radiation dose reduction with IR.IR operates on listmode data as opposed to histogrammed projection data and can generate an image following just one pass through the scan [79] .This results in a shorter scanning time and a reduction in radiationexposure associated with CT thorax to a level approaching that of a plain radiograph [80] .The use of low dose CT with IR is ideal for imaging CF patients and in particular, the paediatric CF population.

(p7.1) In relation to thoracic imaging, ASIR has been shown to significantly reduce subjective and quantitative image noise on both standard and reduced dose chest CT [81] .Dose reductions of 46%80% for thoracic CT can be achieved without compromising image quality [82,83] .In practice, this translates to substantial dose reductions in paediatric CT imaging without substantial compromise in image quality, a strategy that can be applied to imaging in CF [84] .Next generation imaging reconstruction will be performed using "pure" IR such as modelbased iter ative reconstruction (MBIR, Veo, GE Healthcare), iterative model reconstruction (Philips Healthcare), advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE, Siemens Healthcare) and AIDR 3D (Toshiba Medical Systems).Pure IR generates high quality images [85] with an even greater reduction in dose than hybrid IR, for example in excess of 80% dose reduction [86] .MBIR facilitates ultralow dose chest imaging and a number of studies suggest that image quality can be maintained at doses approaching those of a chest radiograph [87,88] .However, the prolonged processing time currently limits its use in routine clinical practice especially for emergency cases.In the case of outpatient imaging for chronic disease assessment, such as in the setting of CF, an hour of reconstruction time is acceptable for the benefits gained.
## (s8) DOSE OPTIMISATION PROTOCOLS
(p8.0) The purpose of CT dose optimisation is to obtain a diagnostic image with the least amount of radiation.Dose optimisation strategies are a priority among imaging specialists.Thoracic CT is particularly suited to dose optimisation protocols due to the high inherent contrast and low radiation absorption of the lung [89] .Recent studies have explored the utilisation of low dose protocols for thinsection CT in the assessment of CF.O'Connor et al [90] compared two noncontiguous thinsection protocols: Protocol A (1 mm section with an effective dose 0.19 mSv) and protocol B (0.5 mm section with an effective dose 0.14 mSv) reconstructed using FBP and using a 4slice CT scanner.Diagnostic acceptability was graded as almost excellent for both protocols, however, the 0.5 mm section was found to be inferior for mediastinal assessment [90] .This study emphasised the fact that lowdose thin section CT is a viable option for accurately evaluating pathological changes in the lungs of CF patients even at doses approaching those of a chest radiograph.

(p8.1) As described above, recent advances in the area of radiation dose optimization and CT have focussed on refinement of IR techniques to allow diagnostic quality images to be acquired at significantly reduced radiation doses.IR when applied to thoracic imaging in CF patients should potentially allow contiguous chest imaging at chest Xray doses which would improve scanning time and reduce the requirement for repeated patient breathholds, which has potential for error.Contiguous CT scanning through the chest will facilitate 3D reconstruction that allows more comprehensive characterisation of distribution of lung changes, facili tates comparison with previous chest radiography and may offer potential for virtual bronchoscopy.Most recently, Singh et al [91] showed that ASIR reconstructed chest CT images can be obtained at 40 mAs/3.5 mGy and still be diagnostically satisfactory.Thinsection protocols have great potential for use in the paediatric CF population where an effective dose reduction of 26% can be achieved without com promising image quality [92] .There may also be a role for lowdose protocols in nonCF bronchiectasis, which accounts for 10% of referrals to tertiary respiratory centres [15] .In 50% of these new referrals, patients are misdiagnosed with asthma until the true diagnosis is confirmed at CT [93,94] .Once a diagnosis of CF is established, some experts suggest that lowdose CT should be performed biannually for assessment of lung parenchyma and bronchoalveolar structures in place of chest radiography [95] .Furthermore, substantial reductions in radiation dose can be achieved using only end expiratory CT in CF as opposed to combined end inspiratory and end expiratory CT.Loeve et al [96] reported a 75% reduction in effective dose when using lowdose (0.4 mSv, 110 kV) end expiratory CT alone while maintaining high interobserver correlation of CF CT scores.Expiratory chest imaging can provide useful detail when air trapping is suspected, as this may not be appreciated on inspiratory CT [97] .Expiratory CT identifies SAD and ideally should be controlled by spirometry [98,99] .SAD is recognised by the presence of hypodense areas within areas of mosaic attenuation and it is estimated that one third of hypodense regions persist over a 2 year period, which suggests irreversibility [12] .This may be used as a separate marker of pulmonary disease in conjunction with CT bronchiectasis scores.

(p8.2) As a large proportion of CF patients are in the pae diatric age group, compliance with scanning methods can be difficult to achieve.Methods of optimising patient cooperation help maximise the information obtained from CT by reducing breathing artefact and the need for repeat imaging.Training in breath holding techniques, lateral decubitus positioning or spirometry may prove beneficial in this regard.In children less than 5 years old, sedation may be required to avoid multiple scans due to movement or inability to follow instructions [100] .Surprisingly, there are no clear data on how CT guided decision making affects outcome in CF pati ents [101] .Owing to the accurate depiction of disease progression, however, lowdose CT scans are regularly used to guide management in clinical practice.In many dedicated CF centres, doseoptimised CT is performed biannually.PFT's are often used in conjunction with CT as part of a multimodal assessment, especially between CT scans.Disease models that encompass age, gender, CT and PFT's can be used as a guide to predict frequency of infective exacerbations or the rate of decline in lung function.Although these models are not yet fully validated, they represent a move towards personalised treatment.For instance, some "lowrisk" patients may only need CT scans every three years as opposed to "highrisk" patients who may need annual scanning.The 2009 CF guidelines do not recommend any specific scanning frequency or interval but recommend CT in symptomatic patients who fail to respond to basic intervention [102] .Ideally, CF management should be personalised and based on risk stratification.
## (s11) THE CHANGING FACE OF CF
(p11.0) There is a constant stream of novel approaches to the management of CF.Most notably, the development of the first disease modifying drug in CF, Kayldeco, has opened up a new realm of possibilities using genomicallyguided medicine [118] .In 2012, Kayldeco was approved by the food and drug administration for use in CF patients with the G551D mutation.Although this particular mutation is only found in approximately 5% of CF patients, it represents a significant breakthrough as it targets the underlying genetic defect within the CFTR gene [119] .Drug trials have demonstrated that Kalydeco can markedly improve lung function; lower sweat chloride levels and help patients gain weight [120] .

(p11.1) Research is ongoing into the possible benefits of Kayldeco in the most common CF mutation: Delta F508, which accounts for 70% of mutations.Results from a phase 2 trial of Kalydeco in combination with VX809 show a marginal improvement in lung function in people who are homozygous for delta F508 [68,121] .These deve lopments have the potential to significantly improve quality of life for CF patients, however, the beneficial effects on the architecture of the lung, as seen on radiological imaging, have not yet been documented.This is an area of potential future research and another reason for optimisation of CT scanning protocols.
