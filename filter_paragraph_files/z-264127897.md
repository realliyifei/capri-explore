## (s0) Introduction and Background
(p0.0) Climate change and global sustainability present pressing challenges, necessitating innovative solutions for managing complex distributed systems such as energy systems.While classical machine learning techniques have been applied to several problems in this area, Quantum machine learning (QML) offers a promising approach to overcome classical machine learning (ML) limitations in climate change research by leveraging quantum computing (Singh et al. 2021).This section introduces the need for significant actions to face climate change, most importantly, by introducing new cutting-edge technologies such as quantum machine learning (QML) (Wittek 2014) to help accelerate the CO2free transition.We present a brief overview of quantum machine learning fundamentals introducing quantum computing concepts and quantum neural network paradigms.The paper highlights the motivation and advantages of using QML to address challenges related to mitigation and adaptation of climate change applications.
## (s2) A brief Overview of Quantum Machine Learning Fundamentals
(p2.0) Quantum Computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, while classical computation is built on the rules of classical physics (Nielsen and Chuang 2010) (Desurvire 2009).Classical computers operate by manipulating bits, while in quantum computers, the information is processed via the means of its building blocks called qubits.Quantum bits or qubits live in a two-dimensional linear vector or Hilbert space, unlike bits that can assume discrete values of either 0 or 1.The two computational basis states that span the Hilbert space of a qubit are denoted by the states |0⟩ and |1⟩ , as shown in Eq. (1).

(p2.1) Quantum computing works on the basis of two principles of Quantum mechanics: superposition and entanglement.Superposition states that the quantum states can be added together and the qubits can be broken down into multiple quantum states.This principle allows the bit to be both Figure 1: Example of q quantum circuit with two qubits (generated using Qiskit) one and zero or neither at any given time which simply represents a linear combination of its states:
## (s3) The role of Quantum ML in Climate Change
(p3.0) Classical ML has already played a crucial role in analyzing climate data and making predictions.As the complexity of climate models and the need for real-time decisionmaking grows, QML offers a new opportunity (Havenstein, Thomas, and Chandrasekaran 2018).There are two primary issues that limit the performance of classical ML algorithms.The first pertains to the availability of high-quality training data, while the second revolves around the computational resources required to handle the immense volumes of data, which is common for climate models on a planetary scale.QML harnesses the unique properties of quantum computing to tackle complex problems more efficiently than classical computers.When applied to climate science, QML can enhance our understanding of climate patterns, improve climate modeling accuracy, and optimize strategies for mitigating climate change impacts.By leveraging quantum algorithms and quantum annealers, QML can process massive datasets, simulate intricate climate models, and optimize resource allocation for sustainable energy production.
## (s5) QML for Decarbonization Acceleration
(p5.0) Decarbonization acceleration refers to efforts and applications aimed at rapidly reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to a low-carbon or carbon-neutral economy.In the context of climate change, decarbonization is a critical strategy to mitigate the impacts of global warming.Energy systems, transportation and agriculture form core applications for this transition.In this section we review literature that address this issue using QML techniques.

(p5.1) Energy Systems Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy-based systems and establishing optimised sustainable management systems are pivotal steps towards achieving climate neutrality.(Ajagekar and You 2022) reviewed the prospects of QC utilisation in general in various areas of applications in energy sustainability to help address climate change.The authors present in depth review about different QC based algorithms that can be used for energy sustainability, including QML methods.Our work in this section differs as we review the literature that implemented QML for energy systems.In a recent study by (Yan et al. 2022), a data-driven approach using multi-agent quantum deep reinforcement learning is proposed for distributed frequency control in islanded microgrids.It combines a traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework with QML for learning the optimal cooperative control strategy.The proposed method reduces parameter requirements and improves training performance.These model improvements inherently enhance the efficiency of islanded microgrids, driving them closer to offering residents more eco-friendly services.In (Andrés, Cuéllar, and Navarro 2022), the authors study the benefits and limitations of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) to solve energy-efficiency scenarios in the contexts of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control, electric vehicle energy management, and profit optimization for charging stations.The results indicate that quantum neural networks offer improved accuracy and cumulative rewards compared to their classical counterparts while requiring fewer parameters for learning.However, the learning process is slower for QRL based models.This suggests the potential for QRL to enhance energy-efficient solutions in various domains.In (Hayder Mahdi Abdulridha1 2022), the authors present the implementation of a quantum neural network as a controller in a photovoltaic solar system.The primary goal was to effectively track the maximum power point and subsequently transfer the panel's generated power to the load with minimal losses.The quantum-driven controller showcased rapid adaptability to a range of environmental conditions, outperforming classical methods thus ensuring better optimization in solar energy systems.(Li et al. 2023) introduced a distributed area autonomy load frequency control (DAA-LFC) technique, designed for the efficient balance of interests among multiple grid operators while ensuring swift frequency restoration in multi-area microgrids.The authors propose a quantum-based algorithm, termed DQMA-DMDPG, which combines large-scale and meta-learning for multitask collaboration by adjusting exploration parameters for varied tasks.The effectiveness of this method in minimizing frequency deviations, slashing power generation expenses, and aligning the interests of different operators was empirically validated.In the context of smart generation control, (Yin and Cao 2022) proposed lightweight robust quantum Q-learning (LRQQL) methods to solve the problems of weak self-adaptation and low convergence rate of current SGC methods of zero-carbon power systems.The authors verify the feasibility of LRQQL algorithms which proves to outperform classical methods such as state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) and Q-learning in terms of control error, frequency error and convergence rate.
## (s6) QML for data forecasting
(p6.0) Data forecasting of time-series data in the context of climate change has many important use cases.Data forecasting can be used to predict the weather, the power load, renewable energy production, and carbon prices.The accuracy of such forecasts is imperative for high-quality decision-making, especially in smart MGs.Accurate and timely forecasting helps policymakers, businesses, and the public to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of climate change.Quantum computers, as recent studies suggest, might be adept at perceiving trends in time series data more effectively than classical methods (Rivera-Ruiz, Mendez-Vazquez, and López-Romero 2022) (Kaushik et al. 2022).In this section, we review the related studies.

(p6.1) Weather Forecasting (Frolov 2017) discuss the fundamental limitations that impede the performance increase of supercomputers based on silicon transistors.The limitations in computing power severely impact the development of accurate numerical weather and climate prediction models.The authors showcase how different global meteorological centers are pushing the boundaries of forecast accuracy and model resolution at the expense of excessive computing power required for such models.(Senekane and Taele 2016) propose a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) algorithm for forecasting solar irradiation which is useful for renewable energy production prediction and weather forecasting.(Besir Ogur 2023) explored the impact of quantum phenomena, specifically superposition and entanglement, on weather forecasting using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) model.Incorporating the entanglement layer between the variational layers has made significant improvements in the circuit performance in this study.Additionally, the use of the superposition layer before the data encoding layer resulted in the use of less variational layers which improves the performance.This study highlights the potential synergy of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) when combined with other techniques, leading to highly accurate models that can calculate weather forecasts very fast.

(p6.2) Renewable Energy Forecasting (Hong and Santos 2023) introduced a novel hybrid model combining quantum processes and residual Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.The proposed model, optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO), aims at one-day-ahead spatiotemporal wind speed forecasting.The proposed method outperforms traditional methods, such as GRU, KELM, CNN, BLSTM, SVRM, and ANN, in terms of accuracy.One limitation of the proposed method is the extended training duration which is attributed to the inclusion of the quantum embedding layer and the exclusive utilization of a quantum simulator.Nevertheless, the proposed method is fast enough for 24-hour ahead wind power and speed forecasting.Due to the randomness of solar energy due to short varying weather phenomena, the output of the PV system will fluctuate.This form of randomness imposes a challenge on forecast accuracy, which will affect the safe operation of the grid.To improve forecast accuracy, a high-precision hybrid prediction model based on variational quantum circuit (VQC) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network is developed by (Yu et al. 2023)
## (s7) QML for climate hazards predictions
(p7.0) Earthquakes rank among the most devastating natural hazards, often leading to widespread destruction and significant loss of life.The importance of developing early warning systems for such natural calamities cannot be overstated.In a study by Dhotre et al. (2022), the potential of QSVM is explored for earthquake prediction.This effort underscores the continued search for efficient predictive tools in the realm of natural disaster mitigation.A separate study by (Bhavsar et al. 2023) presents a QML-based approach specifically tailored for predicting asteroid hazards.By utilizing Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) and the Pegasos QSVC algorithm, the proposed method showed superior performance, registering an impressive accuracy of 98.11% and an average F1-score of 92.69%.Such advancements in QML-based asteroid hazard prediction can significantly enhance real-time risk detection and mitigation, playing a crucial role in safeguarding our planet's biodiversity.
