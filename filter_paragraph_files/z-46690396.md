## (s1) Pathogenesis of EHV-1
(p1.0) EHV-1 infections in horses may become established because of exposure to infectious virus by the respiratory route or by reactivation (recrudescence) of latent virus elsewhere in the body [11].New infections are acquired by inhalation of infectious aerosols or contact with infectious secretions.After inhalation, viral replication occurs in the epithelia of the upper respiratory tract, including turbinates, pharynx, soft palate and tracheal epithelium [12].The virus penetrates the epithelial barrier and by infecting a wide range of cell types, including immune cells, moves into deeper tissues of the respiratory tract and into the draining lymph nodes via lymphatic drainage (Figure 2).Subsequently, a second stage of viral replication occurs in which EHV-1 replication can be demonstrated in lymph nodes by the isolation of infectious virus and the presence of viral antigen in mononuclear cells of the retropharyngeal and submandibular lymph nodes from 12 hours post infection [13] [14].

(p1.1) From 4 to 6 days post infection, the infected lymphocytes migrate from lymph nodes into the blood, resulting in a cell-associated viraemia and then EHV-1 is carried by infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and spreads throughout the body.By this method, the cell associated virus may disseminate to internal organs such as the uterus and nervous system (Figure 2) [15].In the uterus, infected lymphocytes adhere to the endothelial cells in small blood vessels supplying the placenta.This endothelial cell infection initiates the formation of protein clots, leading to thrombosis and vascular damage [16] [17].Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) develops, leading to damage of the placenta and thus the virus spreads to the fetus and consequently results in the abortion (Figure 2) [18] [19].It is suggested that the uterine pathology and/or fetal distress initiates a physiological cascade, resulting in the separation of the placenta from the endometrium [9] [20].In the early 1990s,  some studies reported that viral replication and vascular damage were more prevalent in the late pregnant uterus [17] than in the early pregnant uterus [21].The causes of these differences in the early and late pregnancy are still unclear.
## (s3) Antibody Responses
(p3.0) In the past, serological assays were developed in order to measure serum antibodies with VN and complement fixing (CF) activity in vitro [32] [33].These diagnostic techniques demonstrated VN, which is also called serum neutralising (SN) and CF antibodies appear in the sera of infected horses and are demonstrable from two weeks after experimental EHV-1 infection, up to 1 year or less than 3 months respectively [33] [34].VN antibodies are largely type specific for a foal immunised with an inactivated EHV-1 vaccine, however there was cross reactivity after immunisation with inactivated EHV-4 [35].VN antibodies are directed primarily against epitopes on glycoproteins gB and gC as recognised by the immune system of horses infected or vaccinated with EHV-1 [34].In contrast to the VN antibodies, CF antibodies are usually undetectable by 3 months after infection.The epitopes recognised by CF antibodies are cross reactive with EHV-1 and EHV-4 proteins, resulting in an inaccurate diagnosis using CF antibodies alone [36].
## (s5) Cellular Immune Responses
(p5.0) The cellular immune response is effective in controlling intracellular EHV-1 and consequently to reduce or eliminate the cell-associated viraemia [74].Several techniques can be performed to assess the cellular immune responses including measurement of antigen-specific T cell proliferation, detection of CTL activity, cytokine mRNA expression and EHV-1 specific IFNγ synthesis.
## (s6) Interaction of EHV-1 with the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC)
(p6.0) The majority of studies have focused on the role of PBMC in EHV-1 viraemia which transmits the infectious virus from the primary site of infection to the vasculature of susceptible tissues.Some studies have reported which PBMC subpopulations are infected.An in vivo study was first performed in 1983 to identify infected PBMC by using PBMC from EHV-1 inoculated pony foals.The sub-populations of T and B lymphocytes and monocytes were separated to detect and quantify the presence of virus within these cells.Infected PBMC were detected at day 2 to 14, whereas the number of infected cells was maximal on day 4 post inoculation.The T lymphocyte population was identified as the most predominant cell type infected with EHV-1 during viraemia [88].Furthermore, this study also suggested that pokeweed mitogen (PWM) can promote virus replication in PBMC as the virus was detected in a 10-high fold higher number of PWM stimulated cells.A similar study used in vitro infection of PBMC [89] with similar results.Subsequent in vitro work by Van der Meulen et al. [90] discovered EHV-1 replication in the resting monocytes after in vitro infection of PBMC as well as in T lymphocyte from mitogen stimulated PBMC.In an in vitro study, Gryspeerdt et al. [91] used two EHV-1 strains; neurovirulent and non-neurovirulent to inoculate ponies intranasally.Interestingly, both strains infected cells of the monocyte lineage (CD172α + ) rather than of T lymphocyte (CD5 + ) in the mandibular lymph node and PBMC.In addition, Goodman et al. [92] also looked at the infected cells of all PBMC subpopulations in vitro using EHV-1 green fluorescent protein virus and reported that monocyte was the predominant infected cells.Another previous study demonstrated for the first time that EHV-1 is detectable in all PBMC subpopulations in vivo with CD8 + lymphocytes and B lymphocytes the most frequently infected subpopulations [93].
## (s7) Immunomodulatory Properties of EHV-1
(p7.0) During evolution, like other herpesviruses, EHV-1 has developed immune evasion mechanisms to avoid host immunity [94]- [98].Numerous in vitro findings on EHV-1 immunomodulation have been reported [76] [79] [94] [99]- [101].However, there are only few studies on the in vivo EHV-1 immune evasion mechanism [92] [97] [102] looking at the clinical outcomes and viraemia.Examples of the evasion methods are as follows.Immunosuppression involving a reduction of in vitro PBMC proliferation to mitogens and viral antigens following EHV-1 infection of ponies [76] [86], avoiding antibody-dependent immune responses by inhibiting cell surface expression of viral antigens [103], inducing down-regulation of MHC class I expression on infected cells [101] and inhibiting transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) protein and blocking viral peptide transport to MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum [94].
