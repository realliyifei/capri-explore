## (s5) The asymptotic translations
(p5.0) The Lie algebra of the Killing fields is the anti-de Sitter Lie algebra so(2, 3). Since, however, so(2, 3) is semi-simple, there is no way to single out 'translations' in a canonical algebraic way; nor, since this spacetime does not admit any non-trivial constant vector field, is there a way to single out 'translations' in a canonical geometric manner either. Nevertheless, the coordinate t is timelike and the components of the metric in the global coordinates (t, r, θ, φ) are independent of t, so the Killing field (∂/∂t) a is often interpreted as the time translational Killing field (though, for example, it is not a geodesic vector field). The Killing fields of the spacetime extend to conformal Killing fields on infinity, and, in particular, (∂/∂t) a extends to a timelike one on I . If, however, the 'asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes' are defined simply by the existence of a (timelike) conformal boundary I (possibly with S 2 × R topology) but without any further condition on its intrinsic conformal geometry, then in general I does not admit any conformal isometry. Hence, the spacetime cannot admit any 'asymptotic Killing vector' either. On the other hand, the requirement of the intrinsic conformal flatness of I , i.e. the reflective boundary condition, guarantees the maximal number of conformal Killing fields, and their Lie algebra is isomorphic to the anti-de Sitter algebra so(2, 3) [36].
## (s14) The Abbott-Deser energy-momentum
(p14.0) The Abbott-Deser energy-momentum [35] is based on the decomposition g ab =ḡ ab + γ ab of the spacetime metric into the sum of the de Sitter metricḡ ab and some tensor field γ ab . Then Einstein's equations can be written in the form L G ab = Λγ ab − κt ab , where L G ab denotes the linearized Einstein tensor on the de Sitter background, built from γ ab , and t ab is the sum of the matter energy-momentum tensor and the correction to the linearized Einstein tensor, being quadratic and higher order in γ ab . By the contracted Bianchi identity∇ a t a b = 0 holds, where∇ a is the covariant derivative in the de Sitter geometry and index raising and lowering are defined by the background metric. Thus, t ab plays the role of an effective energy-momentum tensor. Therefore, for any Killing vector K a of the de Sitter background the contractionK a t ab is∇ b -divergence-free, and hence the integral
## (s15) A spinorial expression of Kastor and Traschen
(p15.0) Using the original Dirac spinor form of the Nester-Witten form [26,25], the Witten-type energy positivity proof of [30], originally given for Λ < 0, has been successfully adapted to the Λ > 0 case and yielded a positivity argument by Kastor and Traschen in [49] (see also [57]). Here, the energy-momentum tensor of the matter fields is assumed to satisfy the dominant energy condition, and, as the boundary condition for the (modified) Witten equation, the Dirac spinor constituents Ψ of the conformal Killing vectors of the background de Sitter spacetime are used.

(p15.1) A generalization C a of the conserved currentK b t ba of subsection 3.1, built from t ab , the 'perturbation' γ ab and an arbitrary vector field ξ a , is also given in [49]: this C a is ∇ a -divergence free, and if ξ a is chosen to be a Killing vector of the de Sitter background, then it reduces toK a t ab . Then, it is shown that the flux integral of C b on Σ with the conformal Killing vector ξ a determined by the Dirac spinor Ψ coincides with the spinorial construction above. Therefore, the present spinorial expression of these authors is a nontrivial generalization of the original construction in [35].
## (s16) Asymptotically-Schwarzschild/Kerr-de Sitter data: work of Chruściel and collaborators
(p16.0) Chruściel with a range of collaborators has been investigating definitions of mass in a variety of space-times with Λ positive, negative or zero for many years. The investigations are typically motivated by adherence to a Hamiltonian approach to space-times, following the monograph [59], analysing Cauchy data to arrive at definitions of mass and momentum. In this subsection we review their work on asymptotically-Schwarzschild-de Sitter data and asymptotically-Kerr-de Sitter data. These are discussed in [60] and [61] respectively and these in turn rely on families of initial data for the Einstein equations shown to exist in [62] and [63] respectively. The Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, sometimes called the Kottler solution, can be defined in space-time dimension n + 1 as
## (s19) Three Suggestions of Penrose
(p19.0) In [46] Penrose considered the problem of defining a cosmological total mass in the presence of a positive cosmological constant. He was motivated, at least in part, by his Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (or CCC) rather than by a consideration of isolated systems, which was the motivation of Ashtekar and colleagues considered above. Thus Penrose sought a definition at I + of one aeon which was suitable for carrying through to the next aeon. Interestingly, Penrose considered but rejected the idea of working in a Poincaré patch and using the Killing vector of the steady-state universe to define energy (section 3 of [46]) because galaxies beyond the cosmological event horizon, where this Killing vector is space-like, would be represented as having super-luminal velocities. This could be a problem in a cosmological setting but one that Ashtekar et. al. avoid by considering only isolated bodies.

(p19.1) Penrose makes three concrete suggestions: (1) To seek an expression motivated by the conserved currents that one constructs from a trace-free energy-momentum tensor and a conformal Killing vector of de Sitter space. In CCC one expects matter to become massless near I + , so that T ab will become trace-free, and in de Sitter space there do exist time-like conformal Killing vectors. This suggestion is not worked out in detail but the insight also underlay the earlier work of [49], [55] and [57].

(p19.2) (2) To use his quasi-local energy-momentum construction, as discussed above (see subsection 4.1), at I + . This construction is defined for a space-like 2-surface S, usually a topological sphere. One first solves an elliptic system for the 2-surface twistors on S, which are particular 2-component spinor fields, then forms an integrand linear in the spacetime curvature but with the cosmological constant term removed and integrates over S. This is a well-defined procedure but the result does not have any positivity or therefore rigidity property. In particular it can be zero even in the presence of non-trivial curvature [32]: applied to 2-spheres on the I + of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time it gives zero if the 2-sphere S is homologous to a point on I + and a non-zero constant but of either sign if S surrounds the source.
## (s21) A general TBS-type spinorial expression
(p21.0) As noted above, a key property of the TBS energy in the asymptotically flat case is its positivity and rigidity. Since in the Λ = 0 and Λ < 0 cases the total energy-momenta could be recovered from a unified form based on the integral of the Nester-Witten form (1.2), and moreover the simplest energy positivity proof is arguably the one based on the use of 2-component spinors and Witten-type arguments [28,30], it seems natural to try to formulate the TBS energy-momentum in the presence of a positive Λ in this framework, too. This was done in [32]. 
## (s22) Characteristic data: the work of Chruściel-Ifsits
(p22.0) In [75] Chruściel and Ifsits define a mass from data for the Einstein equations given on an outgoing null hypersurface N , which could be the null cone of a point, in a conformallycompactifiable (n+1)-dimensional space-time. The main interest in [75] is with Λ > 0 but all values of Λ are allowed, and the method is to construct a Bondi coordinate system at N and solve for the space-time metric and connection at N in terms of free data, making assumptions about asymptotic decay rates, for example of any matter content, as required. The paper proposes a definition of mass from a consideration of the TBS mass defined for Λ = 0. The generalised definition is checked against the Λ = 0 case, for which a corresponding calculation was presented in [76], and, by consideration of a variety of examples, with the Λ < 0 case, which is fairly well understood.

(p22.1) The calculation leading to the definition of mass naturally leads to the definition of a renormalised volume for N . This is defined from the integral V (r) of the area A(r) of sections 7 of N of constant r where r is an affine parameter along the generators of N . Given an origin for r, which would be the vertex of N if N were a light-cone but other choices are possible, the authors obtain an expansion: V (r) = r 0 A(r ′ )dr ′ = a 3 r 3 + a 2 r 2 + a 1 r + a ℓ log r + a 0 + a −1 r −1 + o(r −1 ), for coefficients a k given in terms of the data and quantities obtained from the data. Then the coefficient a 0 = V ren is the renormalised volume.

(p22.2) In discussion of the result in the last section of the paper it is observed that the mass defined is geometric and gauge-invariant and coincides in cases of Λ ≤ 0 with other accepted definitions, but that it is not obviously non-negative in general, nor rigid in the sense that vanishing mass implies that the space-time is exactly de Sitter inside the cone N .
## (s23) Total mass in closed universes
(p23.0) The construction of the total mass for closed universes, introduced first for Λ = 0 (and mentioned at the end of subsection 1.1.3), can be generalized in a straightforward way to closed universes with positive Λ [77]. The basis of this construction is the observation that, in the Witten type gauge, the λ AλA ′ -component of the hypersurface integral form of the spinorial expression of all the energy-momentum expressions above (independently of the sign of Λ) takes the manifestly positive definite expression

(p23.1) Here Σ is the asymptotically flat/hyperboloidal hypersurface whose boundary 'at infinity' is just the 2-surface S, the L 2 -norm is defined on this Σ with √ 2t AA ′ as the pointwise positive definite Hermitian scalar product on the spinor spaces, and D AB is the unitary spinor form of the Sen derivative operator on Σ (see [38]).

(p23.2) However, if Σ is a compact Cauchy surface in a closed universe, e.g. when Σ is analogous to the leaves Σ t of the global foliation of the de Sitter spacetime given in subsection 2.1.1, then the above quantity can be formed even when T ab is replaced by T ab + g ab Λ/κ with positive Λ and even for any spinor field λ A with the normalization λ 2 L 2 = √ 2. The total mass M (in fact, mass density) associated with Σ is defined to be just the infimum of P(λ) on the set of spinor fields satisfying the normalization above. Then, the spinor fields λ A for which P(λ) = M holds are precisely the eigenspinors in the eigenvalue equation D AA ′ D A ′ B λ B = (3κ/8)Mλ A . Thus, the mass M could have been defined as the first eigenvalue in this eigenvalue problem. Clearly, κM ≥ Λ by construction, but it has the non-trivial rigidity property: κM = Λ if and only if the whole spacetime is locally isometric to the de Sitter spacetime and the Cauchy surface Σ is homeomorphic to S 3 /G, where G is a discrete subgroup of SU(2) ≈ S 3 .
