## (s1) Localization and functions of CS protein
(p1.0) What is known about the role of the CS protein in malaria parasite biology and pathogenesis has been reviewed previously [9,10]. Initially identified as a Plasmodium berghei ortholog antigen Pb44, the CS protein [11] was shown to be the target of protective antibodies to the sporozoite surface in murine models over 25 years ago [12][13][14]. CS covers the entire surface of sporozoites [15], the form of the malaria parasite inoculated into humans by female anopheline mosquitoes, and is found on the plasma membrane of liver-stage parasites, which develop after sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes. CS has been detected in the cytoplasm of infected hepatocytes and a recent report indicated that CS plays a role in suppression of liver-stage inflammatory responses in a P. berghei model [16]. CS is secreted at the apex of sporozoites, becomes an integral component of the plasma membrane and is continuously released in large amounts at the distal tip of the sporozoite during gliding motility [17,18].

(p1.1) Many observations point to a region of CS as one of the key ligands for adherence to the heparan suphate proteoglycan components of the liver sinusoidal lining prior to hepatocyte invasion [10]. Incubation of live sporozoites in vitro with anti-CS antibodies induces a characteristic morphological change in sporozoite appearance with cessation of motility and shedding of sporozoite surface material. This change, dubbed the circumsporozoite precipitin reaction, was first reported with antibodies raised by irradiated sporozoite immunization [19,20], and later with antibodies raised through immunization with only the conserved Asparagine-Alanine-Asparagine-Proline (NANP) amino acid repeat sequence which forms the immunodominant B-cell epitope from P. falciparum CS antigen [15]. This sequence is species-specific, but highly conserved for isolates from each species.
## (s3) CS-specific CMI and vaccine efficacy
(p3.0) RTS,S-induced CS-specific CD4+ T cell frequency, as enumerated by both ex vivo ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining, is associated with protection against infection [31]. However the available data indicates that IgG plays a more important role in RTS,S-mediated protection than CMI. The potential contribution of CD8+ T cells in killing of intracellular hepatocyte infection is unquestioned. This evidence stems from adoptive transfers and pre-clinical models of whole organism and subunit vaccine immunity [56][57][58] with some indirect evidence from clinical studies [59,60]. CD8 T cells are thought to be the critical determinant of irradiated sporozoite immunity, at least in mouse models where immune mechanisms can be dissected in detail [58]. There is, therefore, good reason to believe that induction of robust liver-stage specific CD8+ T cell responses in addition to RTS,Sinduced IgG and CD4+ T cells, could add to currently achieved levels of clinical protection. There is also evidence for the important role of CD4+ Th1 responses from both pre-clinical adoptive transfer experiments [61] and field trials [62]. Furthermore protective CD8+ responses may be CD4+ T cell dependent [58]. Thus further improving upon currently attained CD4+ T cell magnitude may augment RTS,S-induced protection [63]. It is worth noting that modest CD4+ T cell ex vivo Î³-interferon responses alone at an arithmetic mean of 129 spot forming cells/ million PBMCs induced by DNA/modified vaccinia virus Ankara prime-boost delivery of P. falciparum CS were not associated with efficacy in a sporozoite challenge trial in the UK [64].
## (s4) Conclusions
(p4.0) The available evidence about the protective mechanism of RTS,S/AS strongly supports a critical role for IgG against the CS repeat sequence in the protection seen against infection, whether in multiple clinical challenge trials in USA, adult or paediatric field trials in different age groups and across the distinct transmission settings of The Gambia, Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. Two conclusions follow from this fact. Firstly, future attempts at improvements of RTS,S-mediated protection should be rooted in at least matching the potent IgG response. Secondly, exploratory studies to shed some light on the fine specificity and protective mechanism of the IgG response are a high priority. These same data do not support identification to date of an absolute correlate of protection in the sense of a threshold level where complete protection is conferred at the individual level against a defined endpoint, but this lack of an absolute correlate does not change the above conclusions. The relationship between a protective immune response and reduction in risk of a defined malaria endpoint, be it infection or clinical disease, could perhaps be described graphically (see Figure  1). This type of representation of correlates of immunity has been performed for some other diseases [32] and it may be beneficial for this sort of analysis to be attempted for RTS,S-induced immune responses and malaria efficacy.

(p4.1) There is supportive evidence, although weaker than that for the role of antibodies, that CS-specific CD4+ T cell responses are independently associated with protection against infection. A parsimonious interpretation is that such CD4+ T cell responses and IgG are additive in their protective effect for RTS,S. In some individuals a protective effect of moderate antibody concentrations may be complemented by a strong T cell response and vice versa.

(p4.2) From this it follows that second generation vaccines that are able to match the protective B cell response seen in RTS,S vaccinees, but improve on the CMI aspect, would have a good chance of inducing higher efficacy. A valid hypothesis for vaccine approaches, which induce CMI responses without antibody induction, is whether spectacular CMI responses an order of magnitude higher than has been seen to date with CS-based vaccines could protect in the absence of antibodies. Though an interesting research question, this is a higher risk approach than dual induction of potent IgG and CMI.

(p4.3) Given the recent demonstration of partial efficacy in humans through prime-boost immunization with the ME-TRAP construct in the UK, two approaches appear highly worthy of attention from a technical perspective. These are matching the potent IgG response induced by RTS,S, and improving upon either the malaria-specific CD8+ or the CD4+ T cell responses.
