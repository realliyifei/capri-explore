## (s8) Theorem 6 [8] The probability hierarchy for PFIN in the interval
(p8.0) However, even for Popperian learning, things were getting more complicated as the probabilities decreased (this can be observed both by just comparing the sequences of probabilities in Theorems 5 and 6 and by looking at the arguments that were used to prove these theorems). As result of that, the authors of [8] wrote that the prospects of determining all cutpoints are bleak even for the interval [2/5, 1/2].
