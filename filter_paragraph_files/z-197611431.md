## (s4) Composite Zeolite Coatings
(p4.0) The composite zeolite coatings are constituted mainly by two constituents: a filler and a matrix.Zeolite crystals obtained by using conventional synthesis process act as filler.The matrix is a bulk material in which the zeolite filler is embedded.Furthermore, the matrix provides an interface for binding and holding filler to obtain a continuous and homogeneous coating.It provides the transfer load improving adhesion with the substrate and cohesion among constituents and ensure the barrier properties of the coatings contributing to its durability and functionality in severe environmental conditions.This approach, different from the direct synthesis one, is compatible to conventional paint and varnish technologies, and can use simple and easily scalable technologies without compromising the mechanical and electrochemical stability of the protective layer, making it an attractive solution for production companies.

(p4.1) The adoption of this technological solution allows the development of composite coatings where zeolite filler can exalt the protective barrier action acting as nano-containers for active corrosion inhibitor agents.The idea is to maintain the technological and functional advantage of paints and varnish preserving the high thermal stability of the zeolite observed in severe environmental conditions [51,[58][59][60].

(p4.2) In such a context, in the last years, several research activities were being focused in improving the knowledge on anti-corrosion performances and protection mechanisms of composite zeolite coatings, proposing different deposition techniques and matrix types [61][62][63][64].Particularly in the present review, the composite zeolite coatings technology were classified mainly in two categories: zeolite thermosetting polymer paints and sol-gel coatings, indicating these approaches as the most mature and suitable for their industrial field applicability.
## (s5) Zeolite Painting
(p5.0) Organic coatings are widely used for metal corrosion protection due to the high barrier capacity to ions, water, and oxygen diffusion though the protective layer.In recent years, a new challenge in the paint technology field was to provide coupled barrier protection with coatings able to selectively respond depending on external stimuli induced by operating environmental conditions.The target is to obtain smart painting formulation that triggers a release of an inhibitor only when the corrosion phenomenon occurs, inducing a self-healing action.

(p5.1) Padhy et al. [65] added NaY zeolites, exchanged with zinc metal ion, in an anticorrosive epoxy paint.The results highlighted that Zn 2+ ion exchanged zeolite provides suitable anticorrosion performances, up to 16 days of immersion in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution.The impedance magnitude at low frequency was also three orders of magnitude higher than the unmodified coating.Similar results were observed in an epoxy coating functionalized with zeolite filler used as reservoir of active Ce 3+ ions [66].

(p5.2) Although Devaki and Priya in [67] provided an inhibitory efficiency (IE, defined as percentage reduction of corrosion rate in zeolite-coated sample compared to uncoated one) of the zeolite-coated samples, after immersion in seawater for 2 months, of 93.74%, also by using undoped zeolite filler.

(p5.3) Ahmed et al. [59], investigating Zn, Ca, and Mg cation-exchanged zeolites as filler for an oil-modified soya-bean dehydrated castor oil alkyd resin paint, indicate that zeolites provide a reliable corrosion protection thanks to a coupled action: a physical corrosion protection thanks to a barrier action and a chemical protection due to the interaction of the zeolite surface with the acidic-modified alkyd resin used as matrix producing soaps which passivate the metal substrate.

(p5.4) More recently, Rassouli and coworkers assessed the active corrosion protection performances of epoxy ester coating filled with zeolite nanoparticles with zinc [68] or combined organic and inorganic inhibitors [69].An active anti-corrosion capability was observed for the zeolite filled paint, probably due to a progressive release of inhibitors, providing also a suitable synergistic corrosion protection on coupled Zn 2+ /mercaptobenzimidazole doped zeolite filled in the epoxy ester coating.
## (s7) Sol-Gel Coatings
(p7.0) The sol-gel coating technology is an alternative method that offers the possibility to deposit thin layers of binder-based zeolite coatings.By this approach, coating thickness usually in the range of 10-100 μm by, e.g., controlling the viscosity of the liquid suspension and the dipping speed, can be obtained.

(p7.1) The technology is based on a dip coating deposition procedure (a scheme of the process is reported in Figure 2), where the metal part is dipped in a binder-zeolite solution followed usually by curing (depending on binder typology, in the range 60-150 °C) in order to complete the cross-linking reactions in the matrix and to be sure that the optimal curing of the coating is reached.In the dip-coating process the uncoated sample is immersed in a liquid and then withdrawn with a well-defined withdrawal speed at controlled temperature and atmospheric conditions.During the process, the environmental conditions (atmosphere and temperature) control the solvent evaporation from the diluted sol.During this stage, a densification of the solution occurs, leading eventually to a gelation phenomenon, favored by the presence of solid filler, with the formation of a compact and homogeneous film well adherent to the substrate.The thickness of the coating is mainly defined by the picking speed, the filler content, and the viscosity of the liquid [75].The adhesion with the substrate is guaranteed choosing a suitable binder matrix able to interact both to filler and substrate surface in order to offer high adhesion and cohesion of the constituted composite coating [76].
## (s8) •
(p8.0) Barrier action: The barrier protection offered by the silane-zeolite composite coatings is related to limited diffusion of aggressive species, through the coating, toward the metal substrate thanks to low liquid water permeability of silane matrix [87].At the same time, the presence of zeolite filler in the silane layer increases the film thickness and reduces the layer porosity, exalting the anti-corrosion and barrier properties of the coating [88].
