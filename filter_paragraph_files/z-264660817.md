## (s10) Discussion
(p10.0) According to our study (Fig. 2), a compelling increasing trend was found for the number of articles on the topic of pediatric anesthesia.The number of articles has increased from 202 in 2002 to 954 in 2022.Over 500 articles published annually in this field since 2012.Regression analysis were used to evaluate the trend of the annual articles published in this field, finding the increasing trend will persist.This result revel that researchers pay more and more attention on pediatric anesthesia in the world.It may further promote the development of pediatric anesthesiology.When we investigate the productive countries or regions, found there were 23 countries or area output more than 100 articles (Fig. 3 and Table 1), including 18 developed areas (the USA, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Netherlands, Switzerland, Israel, Spain, Sweden, Austria, Belgium,) and 8 developing area (China, Turkey, India, Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia).Among them, the number of articles in the top 5 are the United States, Canada, Turkey, China, India.It shows that the academic publication productivity is closely related to the size of economies and the level of national development.In addition, the top thirty active institutions showed in Table 3 were located in prosperous areas.It further shows that economic prosperity can greatly promote the output of academic works.Our study is consistent with the results of other bibliometric research in the literature on the relationship between national economic development level and the number of academic publications. [9,32,33]If the author wants to choose an outstanding institution or affiliation in this field for further study, he may pay attention to these institutions in developed country like Boston Childrens Hospital, Childrens Hospital Philadelphia, Ohio State University, University Penn, Nationwide Childrens Hospital and so on.When authorship was analyzed (Fig. 4 and Table 2), the authors including Tobias, Joseph D; Kim, Jin-TaeLee; Ji-Hyun; Martha A Q; Kim, Hee-Soo; Kim, Eun-Hee; Tibboel, Dick; Jang, Young-Eun; Tumin, Dmitry; Bhalla, Tarun, and Cravero, Joseph P have more than 20 articles in pediatric anesthesia.[40] As an old Chinese saying goes, one who stays near vermilion gets stained red.Researchers could read their articles or join outstanding teams to comprehensively learn and understand children's anesthesia-related research.
