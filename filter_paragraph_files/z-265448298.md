## (s0) Introduction And Background
(p0.0) COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is currently the leading cause of death worldwide.The disease is marked by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow restrictions.It is a treatable and preventable disease.It was ranked as the third most prevalent cause of death globally in or around 2016 and as the fourth most common cause of death in the United States in 2017 [1].Due to the expanding population and rising risks of COPD risk factors such as tobacco use, dust, chemicals, burning biomass fuel, rising air pollution, etc., the burden of COPD is predicted to rise even more in the future [2].
## (s6) Symptoms of COPD
(p6.0) Symptoms are generally considered the primary indications of a disease.So it is necessary to know the symptoms of COPD.Generally, individuals suffering from COPD may suffer from a cough that is dry or with phlegm, frequent respiratory infections, shortness of breath, or wheezing.They may experience fatigue or the inability to exercise.Also in some cases, they may experience chest pressure, loss of muscles, loss of weight, etc.To summarize, the symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, or a chronic cough [8].
## (s8) Lifestyle modification in COPD patients
(p8.0) It is known that lifestyle modification is one of the most cost-effective strategies for self-management and secondary treatment of COPD.Hence, we should know the required lifestyle changes or modifications that are needed in COPD patients [9].
## (s9) Quitting Smoking
(p9.0) Smoking is one of the most common causes of COPD or any other type of lung disease.It is the most effective strategy to reduce the progression or exacerbation of COPD.By quitting smoking, one can improve their lung capacity, oxygen intake, and breathing.Many programs are being organized by the government to stop smoking which can help individuals to quit smoking [10].
## (s10) Staying Active
(p10.0) Exercise or in other words staying active is very effective as it strengthens muscles and improves endurance.It helps or trains the body to use oxygen more efficiently and reduces the shortness of breath during regular physical activities.Generally, gentle exercises are recommended, such as slow walking, gardening, etc., as they do not overexert the lungs [11].Moreover, maintaining a healthy weight is also very effective in COPD.If an individual suffering from COPD is overweight, then weight loss can also help in reducing the symptoms of COPD because obesity can lead to breathing-related problems.A BMI of approximately 25 kg/m 2 is considered beneficial for COPD patients.This can be achieved by staying active by doing small exercises like walking [12].
## (s11) Getting Vaccinated
(p11.0) COPD is known to cause lung damage, so one can prevent further lung damage by avoiding infections like pneumonia and influenza by getting vaccinated for such infections as such conditions are the major cause of exacerbation, disease progression, and mortality in COPD.In this way, their lungs are protected from any kind of further damage that could be caused by such infections.So, vaccination is recommended for individuals suffering from COPD, in lifestyle modification [13].
## (s12) Adapting the Work Environment
(p12.0) There are many individuals who are exposed to lung irritants at work.So, COPD patients who are frequently exposed to lung irritants, chemicals, fumes, etc. at work should consult with the supervisor regarding making changes to the work environment and should start wearing protective masks while working.One of the best approaches can be the removal of any kind of respiratory irritants and substituting the toxic agents with non-toxic agents.In the case where substitution is not possible, proper maintenance such as enclosing the industrial process and proper ventilation should be done [14].
## (s13) Medical management of COPD
(p13.0) Exacerbation in COPD results in acute worsening of the respiratory tract, which needs to be managed properly.There are several pharmacological or medical therapies to treat COPD.The various classes of medication used for the treatment of COPD include long-acting beta 2-agonists (LABAs), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) [15].
## (s14) Bronchodilators
(p14.0) Selective beta 2-agonists, anticholinergic antimuscarinic substances, and methylxanthines are all bronchodilators.Currently, they are the primary method of treating COPD.They often come as inhalers and ease the tension in the airway muscles.By using this technique, breathing rate is promoted, and coughing and breathlessness are alleviated.Patients with COPD are advised to take them.The two different types of bronchodilators are short-acting and long-acting.Albuterol, ipratropium, and levalbuterol are a few examples of short-acting bronchodilators.Long-acting bronchodilators include aclidinium, arformoterol, formoterol, indacaterol, tiotropium, salmeterol, and umeclidinium [16].
## (s15) Antimuscarinic Drugs
(p15.0) They are used and administered similarly to bronchodilators.Muscarinic receptors M1 and M3 are primarily involved in this.Following the release of acetylcholine (ACh) by short postganglionic fibers, the M3 muscarinic receptors in airway smooth muscle cells are activated, leading to an increase in motility.Nicotinic and M1 muscarinic receptors are found in the respiratory tract's parasympathetic ganglia, and they are equally activated by vagal fibers.Stimulation of the M3 receptor leads to increased secretion from the bronchi.Cholinergic muscarinic receptors are the target of non-selective antimuscarinic bronchodilators.They have a major impact on airway blockage through submucosal gland cells' antagonistic M3 muscarinic receptors, which cause a decrease in basal and enhanced cholinergic parasympathetic activity, both of which reduce airway obstruction [17].
## (s16) Theophylline
(p16.0) Theophylline, a methylxanthine, is one of the less expensive bronchodilators.Its bronchodilatory actions are brought about by both the competitive antagonism of adenosine receptors and the rather non-selective inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases [18].Typically, it is given intravenously, as sustainedrelease medication, or orally in typical ways.Hepatic metabolism mostly eliminates theophylline.Its elimination half-life usually ranges from eight to nine hours in adults and 3.5 hours in children.In cases of heart or liver failure, viral infection, old age, etc., its half-life is lengthened.Smokers, habitual drinkers, and other risk factors reduce the half-life.One of theophylline's disadvantages is its low therapeutic index.Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, agitation, palpitations, and hypotension are theophylline's main adverse effects [19].
## (s17) Antibiotics
(p17.0) Acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and other respiratory infections among others can exacerbate the symptoms of COPD.The main treatment for bouts of COPD worsening is antibiotics.It has been discovered that certain medicines, such as azithromycin, can stop COPD from getting worse.Antibiotics used as preventatives are useless in the winter [20].
## (s20) Inhalers
(p20.0) Inhalers are an essential tool in COPD management, conveying medicines straightforwardly to the aviation routes.Some of the inhalers that are used are metered-portion inhalers (MDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and soft mist inhalers (SMIs).These gadgets have seen nonstop enhancements in drug conveyance proficiency, usability, and versatility.For example, few inhalers presently have hidden sensors that monitor usage and give inputs to patients and medical services suppliers [22].
## (s21) Nebulizers
(p21.0) Nebulizers are devices that convert fluid medicine into a fine fog, which makes it simpler for the patients to breathe in the medication.Late advancements have focused on reducing treatment duration utilizing the nebulizer frameworks [23].
## (s23) Mechanical Ventilators
(p23.0) Mechanical ventilators play a critical part in supporting breathing as well as keeping up satisfactory oxygen levels for serious COPD patients.Advancements in this area have led to more skilled and adaptable settings, decreasing the chance of confusion and improving tolerable outcomes [25].

(p23.1) Noninvasive Ventilation (NIV) Gadgets NIV gadgets, for example, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) machines, have become more agreeable and easy to use.They are in many cases used to treat intense intensifications of COPD and offer respiratory help without the requirement for obstructive intubation [26].
## (s27) Remote Observing Frameworks
(p27.0) Advancements in this area have been found as a unique advantage in the administration of persistent illnesses like COPD.Ongoing advances in remote checking for COPD include remote painless gadgets that monitor fundamental signs, oxygen immersion levels, and respiratory boundaries, communicating continuous information to medical services suppliers.Integration of computerized reasoning and AI calculations into remote observing frameworks empowers early discovery of COPD intensifications because of minor modifications in information frameworks [30].
## (s28) Telemedicine
(p28.0) Telemedicine refers to the use of information and communications technology to deliver health services, particularly in situations when access to care is hampered by distance.The use of telemedicine is favored by a number of significant features, including real-time audio and video communication that links doctors and patients at the same time, information exchange that does not require both individuals to be present at the same time, and the use of a variety of wearable devices, accessories, sensors, etc.These characteristics guarantee that patients' sense of security, health awareness, and medication adherence are all positively impacted in a way that saves both time and money [31].
## (s29) Single Inhaler Triple-Drug Therapy
(p29.0) A novel advancement has been discovered recently: the ability to combine three medications into one inhaler.It involves the combination of fixed ICS/LABA with LAMA or vice versa.This method prevented the overuse of medications and exacerbation risk while maintaining a high level of safety and health.It also demonstrated improved lung function when compared to ICS/LABA or independent LAMA treatment [32]. Figure 3 shows the newly developed inhaler that combines three medicines, becoming a triple-drug inhaler.
## (s31) Advantages
(p31.0) The ongoing advances in devices used for the therapy of COPD bring various benefits and advantages that preferentially work on the administration as well as on the personal satisfaction of patients.Some of the benefits of these advances in devices are mentioned in the following paragraph.

(p31.1) Current inward breath gadgets, like excellent inhalers and further developed DPIs, guarantee more exact and viable medication conveyance to the lung [22].This designated conveyance upgrades the helpful viability of medicines, promoting better side effects control and decreased aftereffects.Smart inhalers and remote observing frameworks enhance drug adherence by reminding patients to take their assigned portions on time and follow their medicine use.The ability to provide mixed treatments in a solitary inhaler can enable treatment regimens customized for individual COPD patients.This approach ensures that the patient gets the right blend of prescriptions, enhancing their treatment and possibly lessening the number of endorsed inhalers they need to utilize.
## (s32) Challenges faced in device therapy
(p32.0) While late advances in device therapy for COPD provide various benefits, there are additionally some possible burdens and difficulties associated with their utilization.These challenges should be considered for an extensive comprehension of the effect of these developments.Various challenges faced have been mentioned in the following paragraph.

(p32.1) Many high-level COPD treatment devices, like smart inhalers and remote checking frameworks, may accompany greater expenses in contrast to customary inhalers or non-associated devices.These costs could be a hindrance to access for certain patients, especially those without satisfactory protection inclusion or restricted monetary assets.Another challenge faced is that of technological barriers.COPD fundamentally influences more seasoned grown-ups, and some patients may not be familiar with or happy with utilizing complex innovations.This can prevent the successful utilization of smart inhalers, portable applications, or wearable gadgets [37].
