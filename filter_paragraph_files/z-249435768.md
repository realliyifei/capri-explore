## (s6) Solvents
(p6.0) Solvents also have essential roles to play in the synthesis of MSNs. The most efficient and typical examples of alcohol include ethanol, propanol, butanol and pentanol. Alcohols enhance pore formation and alter the sizes of mesopores. However, the morphology and shape of mesoporous materials are minimally affected by alcohols with low evaporation rates and high molecular weights [91]. The channel rotations of mesoporous materials are also modified by alcohols [92].
## (s7) Silica sources
(p7.0) The synthesis of well-ordered MSNs requires precursors such as sodium silicates, colloidal solutions and organosilanes [96], such as TMOS, TEOS, TPOS and TMS [77]. TMS forms silicate mesoporous structures more rapidly than other precursors [97]. As the size of the alkoxy groups in silane increases, the rate of hydrolysis decreases due to steric hindrance (spatial effects), especially in highly branched silica sources [98].
## (s12) Solvent extraction
(p12.0) Solvent extraction is a mild alternative for calcination, requiring high thermal treatment. Based on the type of surfactant and the experimental conditions, either acidic or basic, solvents can be used to extract the synthesized nanoparticles. Examples of solvents used include ammonium nitrate [105], water [106], ethanol [107], hydrochloric acids [108] and other alcohols [109]. Compared with calcination, solvent extraction has less impact on the porosity and structures of synthesized mesoporous materials. However, in most cases, complete surfactant removal cannot be achieved with solvent extraction, but it is possible to re-use recovered surfactants. This method is ideal when complete removal of surfactants is not required [110].
## (s14) Microwave digestion
(p14.0) Microwave digestion is the fastest way to remove surfactants from mesopores. It involves exposing the synthesized mesoporous materials to microwave radiation for about 2 min after being suspended in an HNO 3 -H 2 O 2 solution [117] or hexane and ethanol [118]. This method does not affect the textual properties of synthesized mesoporous materials. It increases the concentration of silanol groups compared with calcinated samples and yields higher pore volume, size and larger surface areas [117].
## (s16) Post synthesis or grafting method
(p16.0) Post synthesis entails grafting organo-trialkoxysilanes or organo-trichlorosilane with synthesized MSNs after surfactant removal by calcination or extraction. The functional groups attached to MSNs are located at the exterior surface or the openings of the mesopores. One of the significant challenges with this method is the possibility of having the mesopore openings blocked with functional groups, which causes the heterogeneous or non-uniform distribution of functional groups on the silica matrix [131,132]. However, this method is suitable for the functionalization of exterior surfaces of mesopore walls [133].
## (s17) Co-condensation method
(p17.0) Co-condensation involves the synthesis and functionalization of MSNs in a one-pot route synthesis. During mesoporous synthesis, organo-alkoxy silanes are introduced together with the silica source and surfactant at the condensation stage [103]. Surfactant is removed using ion-exchange with either an ethanolic solution of hydrochloric acid [108] or ammonium nitrate [105]. This method allows functional groups to be grafted to the outer and inner surfaces of the silica walls, as illustrated in figure 2 [134]. royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R. Soc.

## (s18) Particle morphology and surface charge
(p18.0) The particle size, shape and surface charge are essential factors determining mesoporous materials' in vitro and in vivo drug delivery. MSNs with a diameter of less than 1 Âµm are highly sought in drug delivery as they have fast mass transport and excellent dispersibility compared with their bulk counterparts [87,150,151]. The surface charge and topology of MSNs affects their pharmacokinetics and accumulation at their target sites [152]. The cellular uptake of MSNs, their cellular interactions, distribution and elimination, are controlled by the particle size of the nanocarriers [153]. The surface charge also affects the cellular uptake and the in vivo immune response to mesoporous materials [152,154].
## (s23) Drug release methods
(p23.0) Drugs are released from their matrices through diffusion, erosion and desorption [229]. Their release mechanism depends on pore connectivity and size, the chemical composition of nanoparticle surfaces, physico-chemical properties and loading methods of the drugs. Their release kinetics from their matrices can be regulated by modifying their pore size and geometry, surface functionalization and drug loading methods [135]. Various methods are employed to study the in vitro release of drugs from nanoparticles, including dialysis bag diffusion, reverse dialysis bag diffusion [230], agitations followed by ultracentrifugation/centrifugation [231] and ultra-filtration [232,233].
