## (s14) Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Supplementation
(p14.0) Due to the side effects associated with pharmacologic treatments, there is increasing interest in using complementary alternative medicine (CAM). A wide range of CAM modalities including meditation, vitamins, prayer, and other homeopathic regimens have been implemented, though not well-studied systematically [111].
## (s19) Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES)
(p19.0) Cranial electrotherapy stimulation is a technique which uses a small handheld device to stimulate the brain with a small amount of current. At least one study has combined CES with functional MRI to demonstrate stronger functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex and weaker activity in the SMA, suggesting that CES may suppress disinhibited brain activity associated with TS [160]. A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial known as the Study of CES as an Add-on Treatment for Tic Disorders (SCATT study) is currently underway to determine if CES is a therapeutically meaningful tool to reduce tic severity (NCT03705988).
## (s20) Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
(p20.0) Approximately 5% of patients with TS are refractory to more conservative therapies, and DBS may therefore be a valuable treatment option [161]. However, it is important to be aware of patient selection, target selection, and surgical complications before proceeding with surgical intervention for TS.
## (s21) Candidate Selection
(p21.0) Guidelines for DBS candidate selection for TS were published in 2015 and include 5 main components: (1) a diagnosis of TS which fulfills DSM V criteria made by a clinician with expertise in tic disorders; (2) tics cause significant disability in daily life; (3) YGTSS severity is â‰¥ 35 for at least 1 year; (4) patients have tried and failed conservative treatment in at least three different medication classes and behavioral therapy; and (5) comorbid symptoms such as ADHD and OCD are stable for at least 6 months [162].
## (s25) Adaptive Stimulation
(p25.0) Local field potentials (LFPs) have specific characteristics that correlate with tics and can theoretically be analyzed by the DBS system in a "closed-loop" paradigm to adjust stimulation parameters independently [183]. Bursts of oscillations in the theta range have been associated with worse motor tic severity [184]. Adaptive stimulation minimizes the amount of unwanted stimulation when patients are in a tic-free state and also reduces the power requirements of the IPG [170]. At least one case report demonstrated significant tic reduction with adaptive neurostimulation in response to a 5-15 Hz oscillatory band, which was comparable to the tic reduction seen with scheduled stimulation, as well as a 63% improvement in the estimated battery life [185].
