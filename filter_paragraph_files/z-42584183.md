## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Posterior Chamber Phakic Toric Implantable Collamer Lenses have become increasingly used to correct refractive error associated with astigmatism.These devices are claimed to provide high efficacy in terms of refractive correction.This book chapter is an updated review on the safety and effectiveness and potential complications of the toric implantable collamer lens (Toric ICL) published in peer-review literature.Toric implantable collamer lens (Toric ICL) from Staar Surgical Inc., Monrovia, CA, is a posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens that has been demonstrated to provide safe, effective, predictable and stable visual and refractive outcomes among various refractive ranges of ammetropia [1][2][3][4] .The present review will focus on the use of Toric ICL in the treatment of myopic astigmatism in normal eyes as well as in eyes with keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, after keratoplasty, and also as a secondary piggyback lens.
## (s2) TICL in eyes with keratoconus
(p2.0) In keratoconic eyes in which keratorefractive or other alternative refractive procedures were not a good or feasible option, Toric ICL implantation showed promising results.In this case, for example, Coskunseven et al. 14 evaluated the results of combined Intacs (Addition Fig. 5. Two white arrows: Clearance from the Toric ICL (red arrow) and the crystalline lens (*) is assessed with the slit-lamp.An optical section focused on the implant will allow the surgeon to observe the Toric ICL-lens space (vault).

(p2.1) Technology, Fremont, CA) and the TICL implantation in keratoconic patients with extreme myopia and irregular astigmatism.They reported the outcomes in three eyes of two consecutive highly myopic keratoconic patients who had undergone Toric ICL implantation after Intacs procedure.Implantation of the Toric ICLs was performed at intervals between six and 10 months after Intacs procedure.They did not encounter intraoperative or postoperative complications.An improvement in UCVA and DCVA was found after Intacs and TICL procedures in all eyes.All eyes were within 1 D of emmetropia, whereas the mean manifest refractive spherical equivalent refraction decreased from -18.50±2.61D (range, -16.75 to -21.50 D) to 0.42 D (range, 0 to -0.75 D).The mean difference between preoperative and last follow-up UCVA and BCVA was a gain of 6.67±1.15lines (ranging from six to eight lines) and 4.33± 2.52 lines (ranging fromof two to seven lines), respectively.They concluded that combined Intacs and Toric ICL implantation in a two-step procedure is an effective method for correcting keratoconic patients with extreme myopia.Kamiya et al. 15 showed two patients in whom Toric ICL have been effective for the correction of high myopic astigmatism with stable keratoconus.Both patients had a history of contact lens intolerance, and refraction and corneal topography were stable for 3 to 4 years.Preoperatively, the manifest refraction was -10.00 -6.00 x 100° in case 1 and -8.00 -2.75 x 100° in case 2. Postoperatively, the manifest refraction was +0.50 -1.00 x 90° in case 1 and -0.25 -1.25 x 100° in case 2. UCVA and BCVA were markedly improved after implantation in both patients without progressive sign of keratoconus during 1-year follow-up.They concluded that Toric ICL implantation may be an alternative for the correction of high myopic astigmatism in eyes with stable keratoconus.Recently, the authors have increased the sample size 16 .In a new study they evaluated 27 eyes of 14 patients with spherical equivalents of -10.11 ± 2.46 D and astigmatism of -3.03±1.58D who underwent Toric ICL implantation for mild keratoconus.LogMAR UCVA and LogMAR BCVA were -0.09 ± 0.16 and -0.15 ± 0.09 respectively, 6 months after surgery.The safety and efficacy indices were 1.12 ± 0.18 and 1.01 ± 0.25.At 6months, 85% and 96% of the eyes were within ±0.5 and ±1.0 D respectively of the targeted correction.No vision-threatening complications occurred during the observation period.They again concluded that Toric ICL implantation was good in all measures of safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability for the correction of spherical and cylindrical errors in eyes with early keratoconus, suggesting its viability as a surgical option for the treatment of such eyes.Alfonso et al. 17 also implanted the Toric ICL in 30 keratoconic eyes (21 patients) with a mean myopia of -5.38±3.26D (range -13.50 to -0.63 D) and a mean cylinder of -3.48±1.24D (range -1.75 to -6.00 D).At 12 months, 86.7% of the eyes were within ±0.50 D of the attempted refraction and all eyes were within ±1.00 D. For the astigmatic components J0 and J45, 83.3% of eyes and 86.7% of eyes, respectively, were within ±0.50 D. The mean Snellen UCVA was 0.81±0.20 and the mean BCVA, 0.83±0.18;BCVA was 20/40 or better in 29 eyes 96.7% of eyes and 20/25 or better in 22 eyes (73.3%).No eyes lost more than 2 lines of BCVA; 29 eyes (96.7%) maintained or gained 1 or more lines being the efficacy index of 1.07 and the safety index, 1.16.There were no complications or adverse events concluding that Toric ICL implantation is a predictable, effective procedure to correct ametropia in eyes with keratoconus.
## (s3) Toric ICL after penetrating keratoplasty
(p3.0) The use of the Toric ICL after penetrating keratoplasty has been also proposed.Alfonso et al. 18 , evaluated the efficacy, predictability, and safety of Toric ICL after this technique in 15 eyes that had preoperative myopia ranging from -2.00 to -17.00 D or astigmatism from -1.50 to -7.00 D. Twenty-four months postoperatively, the mean Snellen decimal UCVA was 0.51±0.30.The UCVA was 20/40 or better in 7 eyes (46.6%) and the mean BCVA was 0.79±0.22.The BCVA was 20/40 or better in 12 eyes (80%) and 20/25 in 6 eyes (40%).No eye lost more than 1 line of acuity, 2 eyes gained 1 line, and 5 eyes gained more than 2 lines; 8 eyes were unchanged, being the safety index 1.58.The spherical equivalent was within ±1.00 D in 80% of eyes and within ±0.50 D in 66.6% of eyes, with a mean postoperative value of -0.95±1.12D. At 24 months, the mean endothelial cell loss was 8.1%.they concluded that the results found indicate that Toric ICL is a viable treatment for myopia and astigmatism after penetrating keratoplasty in patients for whom glasses, contact lenses, or corneal refractive surgery are contraindicated.A case report of Akcay et al. 19 also adds valuable literature to this application.They describe that the patient's manifest refraction improved from -8.0 -1.75 x 170° preoperatively, with an UCVA of 0.15 and a BCVA of 0.4, to +0.75 -0.50 x 130° postoperatively, with a UCVA of 0.8 and a BCVA of 1.0.No serious complications or refractive changes occurred during the 1year follow-up concludind that implantation of a myopic TICL in phakic eyes is an option to correct postkeratoplasty anisometropia and astigmatism.
## (s4) Toric ICL in eyes with pellucid marginal degeneration
(p4.0) Kamiya et al. 20 have also recently reported a case in which Toric ICL effectively corrected the refractive errors of pellucid marginal degeneration.They described preoperatively that, in the patient's right eye, the manifest refraction was -10.5 -3.5 x 55°, the UCVA was 20/1000, and the BCVA was 20/16; in the left eye, the manifest refraction was -11.0 -6.5 x 130° and the UCVA and BCVA were 20/1000 and 20/20, respectively.After bilateral implantation of a TICL, in the right eye, the manifest refraction was +1.50 -0.75 x 10°, the UCVA was 20/16, and the BCVA was 20/12.5; in the left eye, the manifest refraction was +2.5 -3.25 x 125° and the UCVA and BCVA were 20/40 and 20/16, respectively.They did not find signs of progressive disease and no vision-threatening complication were observed during the 6-months follow-up.They considered that Toric ICL implantation may be a viable surgical option for the correction of high myopic astigmatism in eyes with pellucid marginal degeneration.
## (s5) Toric ICL for secondary piggyback
(p5.0) The last indication that has been considered for the use of Toric ICL is piggyback implantation.Kojima et al. 21investigated eight pseudophakic eyes of five patients who underwent piggyback insertion of a Toric ICL to correct residual refractive error.The results showed that pre-and 6-month postoperatively logMAR UCVA were 0.759±0.430and 0.201±0.458,respectively, with all eyes within ±0.50 D of intended spherical equivalent refraction and refractive astigmatism within ±0.50 D in five (62.5%) eyes and ±1.00 D in seven (87.5%) eyes.No eyes lost more than one line of BCVA and pupillary block occurred in one eye on postoperative day 1.They concluded that piggyback insertion of a Toric ICL appears to be effective and predictable in correcting refractive error in pseudophakic eyes.
## (s6) Complications and adverse events with Toric ICL
(p6.0) Sanders et al. 5 reported secondary surgical interventions in 5 eyes (2.4%) in the Toric ICL study cohort.In 3 eyes the ICL was removed, in one case due to PI-related visual symptoms, in the second case due to trace anterior subcapsular opacity and in the last case due to oversizing and induced anisocoria.One eye had the ICL replaced with a smaller diameter ICL and another eye had a repositioning due to surgical misalignment.In a more recent study, Kamiya K et al 9 reported secondary surgical interventions in five eyes (8.9%).These eyes required repositioning of the lens very early post-operatively, ranging from one day to one week due to off-axis alignment.Two eyes required late repositioning due to off-axis secondary to a traumatic event.Finally, three eyes developed asymptomatic subcapsular opacity, none of them requiring an ICL removal because there was no impact on BCVA.Otherwise they reported no cases on pigment dispersion, pupillary block or other vision-threatening complications during their follow-up period.Reported adverse events related to Toric ICL are those applicable to ICL in addition to early surgical misalignment and rotation of the implant.Careful marking of the eye's axis and attention to marking the target axis are essential to ensure proper surgical alignment of the Toric ICL.Lens rotations may occur if the lens is too short for the eye's anatomy and in these cases an exchange for a longer diameter ICL should resolve the problem.In rare instances, an optimally vaulting lens may be found off-axis post-operatively; Navas et al 22 found that repositioning of the lens back to target axis when the vault is optimal yield a satisfactory outcome in their case study.Most common complications and adverse events reported with the ICL platform in general include: early replacements due to sizing issues (under-or over-sizing), lens repositioning (surgical misalignment or true early rotation, late rotation), development of anterior subcapsular opactity which becomes clinically significant requiring lens removal and cataract surgery, pupillary block and/or angle closure with elevated IOP due to non functioning peripheral iridotomies (PIs), (too small, too peripheral, occluded or narrowed), and to a lesser extent symptoms of glare/halos or lines coming from the peripheral iridotomies or from the smaller optical zone related to the patient's mesopic pupil diameter.Based on the meta-analysis from Chen et al. 23 where different ICL lens designs were included (prototype and obsolete versions as well as currently available V4 model) the most common complication was cataract formation.Several factors involved in cataract development discussed in this analysis included age, degree of myopia, low vault, surgical trauma, learning curve, steroid use, lens design, pre-existing opacities, trauma and inflammation.Several other peer-reviewed articles support the relatively low incidence of complications with the ICL.In conclusion, Toric ICL has been worldwide used for astigmatism correction showing their efficacy, predictability, stability and safety.Toric ICLs are considered an attractive approach, based in large part on the phenomenal acceptance of intraocular lenses for not only the aphakic or cataract patient but also, recently, the refractive patient.The present chapter reviewed the outcomes for normal astigmatic eyes and also those found in different keratoconic eyes, post-penetrating keratoplasty, eyes with pellucid marginal degeneration and also in pseudophakic eyes with the use ICL as secondary piggyback lens.In general terms, the results of Toric ICL implantation from these studies are in agreement confirming its predictability, efficacy, together with safety outcomes, making this option as a highly reliable alternative in the treatment of moderate to high astigmatism.Then, TICLs are safe and effective tools to compensate for different degrees of astigmatism, involving quite low risks.
