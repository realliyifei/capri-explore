## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Contrary to common beliefs, our nutritional needs decrease little with age and are sometimes higher in late adulthood than in early adulthood.With regard to caloric intake, the European Food Safety Authority (1) recommends a daily allowance from 2000 to 2,500 Kcal for people aged 50 to 59 and from 1800 to 2,300 Kcal for people aged 70 to 79.More recently Volkert et al. (2) established that recommended energy intake should reach 30 Kcal per kg of body weight per day.With regard to protein intake, recent works carried out by the PROT-AGE consortium (3) and by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (EPSEN) (4) show that older people need to ingest more protein than younger people to stay healthy, to maintain their abilities and to fight infections.As a result, the daily protein intake should be 1 to 1.2 g protein per kg of body weight per day for a healthy person over 60 versus 0.8 to 1 g per kg of body weight in younger adults.The literature review by Shad et al. (5) highlighted the importance of a constant distribution of protein intake over the main meals of the day at amounts of 25-30 g/meal to avoid catabolic protein status [see also (3,6)].
## (s1) Materials and methods
(p1.0) The present systematic review followed the approach proposed by Xiao and Watson (25), which summarizes the evidence available on a topic to convey the breadth and depth of that topic.The protocol was written using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P, (26), see Supplementary material).The protocol was deposited on the HAL website 1 and on PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42021244689.The PRISMA checklist is available on the Supplementary material.
## (s9) Characteristics of the included studies
(p9.0) On the 21,493 articles retrieved, 253 records were kept for full text screening and 49 studies were included in the systematic review: 44 original studies (Figure 1; 3,384 participants) and 5 systematic  32) were excluded because they did not provide enough information about the nutritional strategy used.The included articles were published between 1996 and 2021, and most were published after 2011 (n = 34) (Table 1).The studies mainly took place in Europe (n = 33).The rest took place in Australia (n = 4), North America (n = 4) or Asia (n = 3).The setting was most often the hospital (n = 20) followed by nursing homes (n = 13) and home setting (n = 13).Twenty-seven studies of the selection were longitudinal with follow-up times between 10 days to 12 months and 16 studies were cross-sectional (Table 1).In addition, 30 studies used a between-subject design while 13 studies used a within-subject design; only 1 study was observational.Finally, sample sizes varied (ranging from 7 to 320 participants), but most studies recruited 20 to 49 subjects (n = 17).
## (s12) Assessment of the nutritional impact of DIY food-based fortification
(p12.0) Forty studies assessed the impact of diet enrichment including DIY food-based fortification on nutritional outcomes (food and/or nutrient intakes, nutritional status or body weight) compared to a standard diet (Table 4).Among these studies, 3 combined DIY foodbased and diet-based fortification (i.e., modifying the diet by adding nutritionally rich foods), 6 combined food-based fortification and fortified foods marketed by the Food Industry, 1 combined foodbased fortification and Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS), and 2 combined food-based fortification, diet-based fortification and ONS, while 27 studies assessed the impact of DIY food-based fortification alone.Nutritional intake was mainly measured by using dietary record.Nutritional status was mainly assessed by measuring body weight or BMI (20     When all the studies are considered, results highlight that provided protein-fortified foods led to a significant increase in protein intake (26 studies over 29) and that provided energy-fortified led to a significant increase in energy intake (15 studies over 20).Only a few studies showed a significant impact of DIY fortification on nutritional status compared to regular food offer: 3 out 8 observed a significant           y, year old; d, days; m, months; w, weeks; RCT, randomized controlled trial; HDM, home-delivery meal; FF, fortified group; SF, standard group; BMI, body mass index; BW, body weight; MNA, Mini Nutritional Assessment; SGA, Subjective Global Assessment; NA, not applicable; +, significant increase; âˆ’, significant decrease; 0, no significant differences.Articles with outcomes labeled "Not specified" did not show statistical value of p test for outcomes concerned.Bold: study that assess the impact of DIY fortification alone.*Mean length of stay from admission to discharge.a Comparison with baseline and follow-up; b Comparison between control group and fortified group (in this column "+" means that results are significantly higher for fortified group compared to control group).
## (s13) Comparison of DIY food-based fortification with other alternatives
(p13.0) Seven studies evaluated two DIY food-based fortification strategies with either different energy/protein loads (36,49,59), different fortificants (46,61,65) or different portion sizes (43).Four studies compared DIY food-based fortification with another alternative such as ONS ( 76), (74), adding high-energy and/or high-protein food items to the menu (55), or increased staff assistance to older people during mealtime (50) (Table 5).However, very few studies have produced statistics to compare the different options.Not surprisingly, higher energy/protein loads are associated with higher energy/protein intake (36,49).However, there was no significant difference between the 1.2 and the 1.5 g of protein / kg of body weight / day in the evolution of nutritional status and muscle mass over the 12-week intervention (49).In Ziylan et al. (43), the reduced-size enriched chicken meal led to a significantly higher energy intake than the normal-size meal.However, the difference in intake was rather small and no impact of portion size was observed for the enriched beef meals.In Evans et al. (46), a combination of three amino acids significantly improved muscle mass over 2 months while no change was observed when a single amino acid was used to fortify the orange juice.Stow et al. (76) observed no difference between food-based fortification and ONS while Sossen et al. (74) observed a slight advantage for DIY food-based fortification compared to ONS.Energy and protein intakes were higher with DIY fortification than with ONS, and body weight was stable with DIY fortification whereas it decreased with ONS during the 6 months of follow-up.Finally, providing DIY fortified food led to higher energy and protein intake when compared with improving staff assistance to older people during mealtime (50).A survey of the literature allowed the identification of five systematic literature reviews close to the topic of the present review (21-24, 30).Firstly, the systematic review of Trabal and Farran-Codina (23) investigated whether, compared to a standard diet, DIY food-based fortification with regular ingredients and/or powdered modules could improve energy and protein intake in older adults in hospital settings, long-care facilities or home settings.This review included 9 articles.The authors concluded that DIY fortification is a valid intervention for improving energy intake in older adults yet there was insufficient evidence for protein intake, nutritional status and body weight.Secondly, Morilla-Herrera et al. ( 21) targeted all studies related to DIY food-based fortification with macronutrients to prevent the risk of malnutrition in older patients receiving hospital services for acute or chronic disease, in older people living in nursing homes and in older people with home-care.This review encompassed 7 articles, and the meta-analysis highlighted that DIY food-based   The present review retrieved 44 articles that tested DIY foodbased fortification in people over the age of 65.This review differs from previous reviews in the following respects.Firstly, we focused the review on DIY food-based fortification, i.e., the addition of regular food ingredients or macronutrient extracts into conventional food matrices to increase energy and protein content in the final dishes. .Thirdly, we considered not only nutritional outcomes but also acceptability outcomes.In addition, we used a wide range of keywords to account for the lack of consensual terminology regarding the concept of DIY food-based fortification (Supplementary material).This allowed us to identify a much larger number of articles than in previous reviews.
## (s16) Limitations and strengths of the present SLR
(p16.0) The strength of this paper is its reliable literature search, with a complete overview of nutritional and acceptability issues for fortified food targeting older people.Given the lack of a consensual definition of the concept of food-based fortification, we have used a broad set of keywords to retrieve articles of interest.The limitations of the present literature review are the following: the literature search strategy did not include trial registries, nor grey literature, and it was restricted to English papers.There are two discrepancies between the present method and the one published before the review was carried out.In the published method, we considered including papers published in both English and French (the authors' native language), but papers in French were ultimately excluded in order to avoid a language bias in the literature search.In addition, in the published method, we considered including papers related to micronutrients fortification, but ultimately focused the scope of the present review on macronutrient fortification, otherwise the scope of the review would have been too broad.Finally, a limitation lies in the fact that it was not always easy to determine whether the products used in the nutritional interventions were a DIY fortified food, a fortified food marketed by the Food Industry or an ONS.For instance, we excluded the studies where enrichment consisted of providing participants with a sachet of nutrient constituents to be dissolved in water [for instance (82,83)].Indeed, dissolving a sachet of powder in water is more like taking a drug than having a drink.Conversely, all the interventions consisting of adding a nutrient-dense ingredient to a food matrix were included, even when the fortificant was very specific [for example, branched chain amino acids powder (58), L-carnitine (46)].However, the question arises as to the accessibility of this type of fortificant to the end-user in real life.
