Fields: Computer Science

## (s5) | Typing speed
(p5.0) From the collected KD data, the user typing speed can be determined by means of several measures, such as the words per minute (WPM), defined in [19] as the average number of words that could be typed by the considered user in a minute. This value is estimated in [19] by considering the length in characters of the input string (IL, excluding backspaces), Screen motion event (SME) P Finger touch pressure on the mobile device screen A Finger area on the mobile device screen TC Finger touch coordinates (x, y) on the mobile device screen
## (s16) | Sensor information
(p16.0) Modern mobile devices embed several sensors which may provide data to be used for KD-based biometric recognition [21], in addition to timing information. For instance, since the emergence of smartphones with touch screens, finger pressure (P) and area (A) are two of the most-commonly exploited characteristics that are used within the KD framework [22]. Similarly, the way a user holds the phone, the amount of acceleration observed while moving, the number of fingers used during typing, are all relevant information that can be used to complement and support KD-based biometric recognition in the framework of continuous authentication [23]. The Android platform categorizes the aforementioned sensors according to three classes, that is, motion sensors, position sensors, and environment sensors 2 . Additionally, the touchscreen itself has its own set of managed events. The signals which can be recorded by a mobile device through sensors belonging to such groups, and used for biometric recognition purposes analysing the users' typing behaviour, are detailed hereafter. Environment sensors are not described here since they do not collect data regarding the users' interaction with the device.
## (s17) | Screen motion event sensor data
(p17.0) The Screen Motion Event (SME) class in Android OS defines a set of events which are executed when any kind of motion occurs on the touchscreen of a mobile device. Among them, screen pressure reports the pressure (P) exerted by a finger on the touch screen, with values in the range between 0 and 1. Such elements, indicated as P 1 ,…, P n in Figure 6, actually contain two pressure values: the one applied when the finger is pressed against the touchscreen, and the one at the moment of removing the finger from the touchscreen. Pressure data have been employed for the first to design KD-based biometric recognition systems for mobile devices in [24].

(p17.1) When the finger touches the screen of a mobile phone, the touch area (A) can be also recorded. Two finger area values are taken for each key, at the press and release event. Generally, the value of the touch area is a float value between 0 and 1.

(p17.2) Similarly, also the (x, y) touch coordinates (TC) can be recorded, with the centre (0, 0) set either with reference to the whole keyboard, as typically done and shown in Figure 6, or to the centre of the pressed key, as in [25] where the distance from the centre (DfC) is computed from the TC at the release event.
## (s23) | Personal identification numbers
(p23.0) PINs have been always used in the access control protocols of mobile devices, mainly to unlock SIMs. They are also often required to access online services such as bank accounts. Not by chance, most of the research on KD-based biometric recognition for mobile devices has focused on PINs as input. The first proposal of a recognition system for mobile devices relying on KD has actually investigated the discriminative capability of the behaviour recorded while typing four-and 10-digit PINs [15], collecting data from 16 subjects using a modified handset connected with a desktop computer.

(p23.1) The first dataset comprising PINs collected through a mobile phone has been presented in [26]. Different phones have been yet used by each of the 25 involved subjects, with this aspect possibly affecting the computed recognition performance. All the employed devices were equipped with a hard keypad, with keys arranged in a 4 � 3 matrix. The same type of keyboard was embedded in the Samsung SCH-V740 model, employed in [27] to record KD from 25 subjects, each donating 30 KD samples. In order to increase typing uniqueness, temporal cues, working like a metronome, have been provided during acquisitions to help subjects keeping the beat. Given the limited capabilities of the employed devices, only timing information has been collected in both aforementioned studies.

(p23.2) Since then, research on mobile KD biometrics has been performed on data collected using smartphones with soft keyboards. However, it has to be mentioned that, when using the Android platform and factory designed soft keyboards such as Gboard, it is not possible to extract the needed timing information since the function is inhibited for privacy reasons. Therefore, researchers are required to develop custom soft keyboards using the available support 5 , install them on the mobile device, and thus record and get access to the desired KD data. This is typically done trying to resemble the layout of the default soft keyboards available in smartphones [59].
## (s24) | Password
(p24.0) A Nokia 6680 equipped with a hard keypad has been employed in the first detailed evaluation of the discriminative capability of KD recorded while typing passwords [40]. Specifically, six different passwords, each made of ten characters, have been collected from 30 subjects, providing 20 samples for each password. The employed keypad had characters multiplexed in a 4 � 3 matrix, with more characters associated to the same key. As for the other studies conducted on mobile devices with hard keypads, only timing information has been acquired.

(p24.1) A public database 8 has been described in [41]. Two acquisition sessions have been carried out, with 42 subjects asked to provide 30 passwords in each session. Five subjects have used a Mobil LG Optimus L7 II P710 phone, while 37 other subjects have used a Nexus 7 tablet. The password '.tie5Roanl', requiring 14 key presses due to the need for switching two times between upper-and lower-case letters, and two times between letters and numbers, has been employed. The collected information consists of timing data, together with finger pressure and area, and have been used also in the work [60].

(p24.2) Another public dataset 9 has been presented in [43], where 53 individuals have participated in the recording process, typing the password 'rhu.university' for five times during each of three acquisition sessions, with time periods between 3 and 30 days separating each session. Only timing information has been there collected and made available. Yet, no test has been performed on the collected data.

(p24.3) Forty subjects, each typing 20 passwords, have participated in the collection of the dataset described in [44]. Gyroscope information has been there considered for the first time in the KD-based biometric recognition framework, together with timing and accelerometer information.

(p24.4) A detailed study on KD data recorded having subjects using only a thumb, two thumbs, or the index finger for typing, has been conducted in [25]. A Nexus 5 phone held in portrait orientation has been used to record 10-character passwords from 28 subjects during two sessions, taken one week apart. For each hand posture, participants have typed six different passwords in random order, 20 times each. In addition to timing and pressure data, also touch locations have been recorded during each acquisition. The collected database has been used to perform the first proper evaluation of performance achievable using KD on mobile devices in within-and across-sessions comparison conditions.

(p24.5) A public dataset 10 has been also outlined in [45], where 10character passwords have been collected from 56 subjects. Specifically, two distinct recording sessions have been there carried out, the first one using a Nexus 7 tablet, and the second one with a Nexus 9 model. The two sessions have been respectively employed for enrolment and verification purposes in the performed tests, therefore implementing an across-session and across-device experimental framework using the recorded timing, finger pressure, and finger area information.
## (s25) | Passphrase
(p25.0) Long fixed texts have been considered as input of the proposed KD-based biometric recognition systems for mobile devices only in few works. Actually, such modality is probably the least suitable to be considered for practical applications. A 17-character passphrase has been recorded from 152 subjects, each typing the same sentence for 10 times using a Galaxy Nexus, in [49], where only timing information has been collected.
## (s26) | Free text
(p26.0) Performing automatic recognition on the basis of the KD recorded while typing free text is commonly considered a much more difficult task, with respect to the exploitation of fixed text. Nonetheless, being able to recognize users in dynamic text conditions would allow performing continuous authentication, with legitimate subjects recognized while using mobile devices for tasks such as writing email or text messages, activities which are nowadays daily performed by every smartphone user. The research on this topic is therefore extremely relevant, with several approaches proposed especially in recent years.

(p26.1) It has however to be remarked that free text recognition has been considered in one of the very first attempts of performing KD-based recognition on mobile devices. The authors of [61] have in fact collected texts composed by a mixture of quotes, lines from movies, and typical messages, from 32 subjects, each typing 10 messages during three acquisition sessions. The typed sequences had varying length, with an average of 14 words per text. Data have been acquired through the same modified handset employed in [15], being able to acquire only timing information.

(p26.2) Also pressure data have been instead collected in [52], where post-login attacks have been considered. Sentences having a length varying from 14 to 53 words, and an average of 23 words, have been shown to the 40 involved subjects, then asked to enter the required sentences using the virtual keyboard.

(p26.3) An evaluation study lasting 8 weeks and involving 26 subjects has been described in [53]. Participants have been asked to normally use a mobile phone during the experiment, with the most active one typing 4702 messages, and the least active using the phone for 29 times. The recorded instances include both simple messages as well as inputs requiring alphabets and special characters. For each text, information regarding the timing and TC of pressed keys are collected together with the accelerometer information.

(p26.4) Texts have been recorded from subjects holding devices in either portrait or landscape orientations, and typing while either seated, standing, or walking, in [11]. Each of 36 participants has provided at least 22 text messages in each of six considered experimental conditions. As in [52], the involved subjects have been asked to replicate sentences shown in a box, thus performing a transcription task, which may have an impact on their typing patterns. Timing, device orientation, user position, and instantaneous gyroscope data have been recorded.

(p26.5) The study on [54] has been carried out on data gathered using a Samsung Galaxy S5 device from 32 users, asked to input 60 different words, with five words for each of different lengths, ranging from two to 13 characters. Furthermore, a set of 15 questions requiring participants replying with words from memory, rather than copy them from screen, has been submitted to the involved subjects. Timing, finger area, and TC have been recorded during typing activity.

(p26.6) OTPs have been instead considered for the first time in [55]. This kind of entry can be considered as a special case of free text, where six-digit randomly generated PINs are used to perform recognition only once, being therefore impossible to train a given classifier over data comprising the same characters. One hundred subjects have been involved for data collection, with each of them providing at least 10 OTPs during two acquisition sessions, while timing information has been collected together with finger area and pressure.

(p26.7) Typing sessions made up of 15 sentences, each having around six terms without digits, have been performed in [56] using a Samsung Galaxy S5 phone by each of 24 subjects. Only one of them, employed as legitimate user in the performed experimental tests, participated in multiple sessions, while the remaining ones performed only a single recording session. Two typing conditions, involving the usage of one hand or two hands for typing, have been considered, collecting timing and TC information during each session.

(p26.8) As in [53], free typing in the wild has been performed by 30 subjects during 3 weeks in [57], where six different postures, involving for instance typing with either two thumbs or only one, have been considered. The collected data comprise timing and touch coordinate information and are available upon request 13 .
## (s29) | Features employed for free text representation
(p29.0) While all approaches dealing with KD derived from fixed text employ similar methods for generating the used biometric representations, either collecting signals at specific and expected time events, or computing statistical features summarizing the observed behaviour, more heterogeneous MAIORANA ET AL. approaches have been proposed to process free text inputs. In fact, in this latter case the signals collected during enrolment and recognition stages can be considerable different, in term of content and length. In principle, it is not even guaranteed that a subject types the same keys during the two phases. Therefore, specific strategies have to be defined to generate templates which could be compared to determine their similarity. Some approaches have been defined to select, from the collected data, a subset of events which are most likely to occur several times while typing free texts. For instance, only the most recurrent characters have been employed in [61] to perform recognition regardless the actual words or sentence composed by users. For such characters, which have been identified as the set {E,T,A,O,N,I}, the hold time KHT has been computed and used as discriminative feature. An analogous approach has been followed in [52], where the 40 most frequently used combinations of consecutive keys have been chosen according to the statistical distributions of English words. The RP D di-graph latencies associated to such pairs have been used to create the desired templates, together with KHT and pressure information associated to each of the 41 keys available in the employed keyboard. A dynamic feature space has been considered in [11], where hold times, di-graph latencies, and instantaneous gyroscope, orientation, and position, for which at least a minimum number of four different instances are available, have been used at the early stage of the data collection process, with the feature space growing as more data is being collected. Only the first two pressed keys of each typed word have been instead considered in [54] to define the employed template, together with statistical metrics of all the collected di-graphs, coordinates, distance, velocity, and finger area.

(p29.1) Conversely, the entire amount of collected data is employed in [53], without performing any selection, by directly storing the time series associated to the duration of a keystroke, the time since last keystroke, and the distance from last keystroke. The recorded sequences are divided into different 'views', depending on whether the performed keystroke is associated to an alphabet letter or to a special character. A third view consisting of the time series recorded by the accelerometer sensor has been then added. Statistical features associated to all pressed keys and related to the corresponding TC, drag distance and velocity, and KHT, have been instead considered in [56]. Distributions of data have been also estimated as in [55,57]. In the former case, the layout of the employed virtual keyboard has been considered to categorize consecutive keys into pairs having similar distances in either left or right directions. The flight times corresponding to each occurrence of the so-defined pairs are then averaged to assign representative features to each data point, thus creating graphical representations of the collected data having travel distances on the xaxis, and corresponding flight times on the y-axis. Missing points which could not be evaluated on the basis of the collected data are instead estimated resorting to a polynomial curve fitting algorithm. As for [57], data recorded during a typing activity are represented through distributions of KHT, di-graph latencies, TC, and drag characteristics. Gaussian distributions are used to model the distribution of the collected samples. In order to exclude breaks in the typing process, a maximum typing gap time of four seconds is set, after which the related keystrokes are not considered for computing the considered statistics.
## (s32) | Free text comparison
(p32.0) User identification on the basis of free texts has been performed in [53]. As mentioned in Section 4.2, three different views, namely time series of alphabet keystrokes, special character keystrokes, and accelerometer values, have been there employed to represent the collected data. A deep learning approach based on recurrent neural networks has been then used to separately model each considered time series. Specifically, three gated recurrent unit bidirectional recurrent neural networks, trained with a RMSprop approach with Nesterov momentum, process the considered views to extract discriminative representations, with the last layers of each network concatenated before performing identification. Network training is performed for an increasing number of enrolled users, from only two to all the 26 available subjects, to evaluate the behaviour of the achievable accuracy. As expected, given well-known properties of identification processes, the achievable performance worsens as long as the number of considered user increases.

(p32.1) Standard machine learning approaches have been used in most of the studies performing closed-set verification on KD data acquired when typing free text on mobile devices. Specifically, RF has guaranteed the best recognition rates in [52,55], while CART have been used together with LR in [11]. SVMs with Gaussian kernels have been employed in [56], and also neural networks have been exploited, as in [54,61]. In more detail, a radial basis function network has been preferred over MLP in [61], since it requires the definition of only two parameters for each neuron. As mentioned in Section 4.2, five different networks have been trained, for varying sizes of the set with most recurrent characters. An MLP neural network with a single hidden layer and binary output has been instead employed in [54].
## (s33) | PERFORMANCE
(p33.0) The best recognition rates achieved in the surveyed studies are reported in Table 3, grouped in categories defined on the basis of the employed input and the considered recognition modality. Specifically, the achieved results are expressed in terms of:

(p33.1) � False acceptance rate (FAR), providing the percentage of recognition attempts made by impostors that are falsely accepted in systems working in verification modality. Low values of FAR correspond to secure systems; � False rejection rate (FRR), providing the percentage of recognition attempts made by legitimate users that are falsely rejected by the system, in systems working in verification modality. Low values of FRR correspond to usable systems; � Equal error rate (EER), the operating point where FRR and FAR are equal. For a verification system to be accurate, the EER should be as low as possible; � Correct identification rate, giving the probability of correctly determining the identity of the presented subject among a set of possible users, for systems working in identification modality.

(p33.2) The achieved results show that KD acquired through mobile devices is actually characterized by discriminative capabilities. Systems performing verification in open-set conditions, attaining EERs at about 2%-4%, have been in fact designed using both PINs and password as fixed-text inputs, as for instance in [25,27,31,34,36]. Even better results have been shown in [44], although evaluated on a quite small set of users. Thanks to be possibility of training classifiers on the whole set of subjects considered during testing, lower EERs have been achieved in closed-set verification conditions, such as in [26,30], and [39]. Even though it represents a more challenging scenario, low error rates have been also achieved when processing free-text KD as in [52,56], where closed-set conditions have been considered. The hardest scenario to consider seems the one involving OTPs, which actually represent inputs hard to be processed even when collected through computer keyboards [63].
## (s34) | OPEN ISSUES AND FURTHER RESEARCHES
(p34.0) Although biometric recognition on mobile devices based on KD has been investigated for more than a decade, it can be still considered a biometric modality at the early stages of its exploitation. Actually, the analysis of the typing patterns performed on mobile devices has attracted far less interest than its counterpart on physical keyboards, for which more in-depth evaluations have been conducted [64], and commercial applications have been proposed 15 . Nonetheless, given the pervasiveness of mobile devices, the rapid technology advancements which have led to the embedding of several miniaturized sensors, and the widespread of available applications, the design of systems exploiting KD to recognize the legitimate users of mobile devices would be an extremely interesting and profitable field of research. In fact, it would allow performing non-invasive and transparent access control to many services in our everyday life. However, before KD-based recognition can be considered a practical and feasible recognition modality for mobile devices, significant efforts have to be made and relevant aspects have to be still properly investigated.

(p34.1) One of the major issues affecting the current state of the art is the lack of public databases on which perform research. As evident from the information reported in Table 2 and in Section 6, most of the works proposed in literature have been tested on in-house databases, thus preventing the possibility of conducting proper comparison among different approaches, with only few exceptions [34,36]. In order to foster the research on this topic, it is therefore of primary importance to collect, and make publicly available, datasets comprising KD recordings collected on mobile devices. In doing so, several aspects representing issues of currently available datasets have to be considered.

(p34.2) First of all, it has to be pointed out that the language analysed in most of researches on KD is English, which leaves the influence of the used language in the framework of biometric recognition still unexplored [65]. It would be therefore required to better investigate scenarios involving non-alphabetic characters to verify whether the proposed approach are robust to language changes.
