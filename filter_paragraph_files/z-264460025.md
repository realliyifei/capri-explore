## (s0) I. INTRODUCTION
(p0.0) Significant use of location-based service (LBS) has been to the point of needing indoor service coverage.After the COVID-19 pandemic passed, the increasing use of indoor activities has been the main drive in indoor LBS development.As the Global Positioning System (GPS) poorly provides sure accuracy, especially in indoor environments, indoor localization research is still in high demand [1].Indoor localization provides benefits when satellite signals are blocked, and GPS cannot work well.It also supports some applications, i.e., activity recognition, especially utilizing Radio -Frequency (RF) -based technology, e.g., Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), ZigBee, and ultrawideband (UWB) [2].The Wi-Fi technology, which is low-cost and widely available, is a promising technology for indoor localization.One recent trend in Wi-Fi-based research, especially on indoor localization, is exploring the sensing capabilities of Wi-Fi signal, or "Wi-Fi Sensing."[3]- [5] Wi-Fi technologies are available in almost any personal device, e.g., smartphones, tablets, and car gadgets.Wi-Fi sensing can be described as the utilization of Wi-Fi signal parameters to sense the environment, i.e., by observing the change in the channel properties known as Channel State Information (CSI), Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Time-of-Flight (ToF), and Doppler effect analysis [5].In this survey, we focus on CSI-based Wi-Fi sensing because of its beneficial points in recognition of coarse-grained or fine-grained human activities, from the heartbeat signal low to high-moving types of activities.[6].

(p0.1) Unlike RSSI, which is prone to fluctuation, CSI gives a more accurate parameter representation since it comprises amplitude, phase, and power.The main drawback of CSI utilization is that this parameter could be more straightforward to obtain.However, notable work recently made the CSI more flexible and low-cost has been published [3].In addition to human activity recognition, the CSI parameter is also helpful for indoor localization parameters, especially the one usually defined as passive localization or device-free localization, which means that the objects or targets do not need to carry any devices to localize.
## (s2) A. Wi-Fi Sensing Techniques
(p2.0) Ubiquitous Wi-Fi networks' coverage has become the primary spark in research on intelligent systems and the Internet of Things (IoT).Wi-Fi applications are generally popular from the desktop or personal computer connection to the internet.Recently, with the support of the advanced technology development and standard of IEEE 802.11, the applications of Wi-Fi sensing are now expanding to intrusion detection, virtual and augmented reality, healthcare, smart home, and indoor localization [5], [6].

(p2.1) This paper survey the application of Wi-Fi sensing on indoor localization system, especially for the most common techniques utilized by RSSI and CSI.These two parameters also usually come along as reasonable compensation for coarse-grained and fine-grained localization: 1) RSSI-based Technique: RSSI represents the power in the receiver.This parameter has the trait to be high in fluctuation due to environments and transmitting time.The parameter can be straightforwardly obtained by lowcost and less complex RF-based, especially Wi-Fi devices, both dedicated and infrastructure-based. RSSI can be applied to indoor localization for distance and distance-free techniques, trilateration, and fingerprint or radio maps.For its fast and straightforward implementation, RSSI is known for the best parameter selection for indoor localization.However, it poses some challenges, especially when the environment is highly dynamic [1].Most approaches are also device-based or conventional, where the target must carry a localization device.In addition to inflexibility, it also comes in cost when the system's scalability increases; some fluctuation due to the larger area of interest or more extended time in collecting data will degrade the overall system's accuracy as we concern only a few approaches using RSSI for passive localization (device-free) [8].

(p2.2) 2) CSI-based Technique: Unlike RSSI, the main challenge of CSI is its data extraction or collection as it is channel model-based, and the signal parameters are pretty complex.Compared to RSSI, CSI needs some extension of hardware and software, for example, the Atheros CSI tools.CSI represents the multipath effects on the propagation mechanism of the transmission link.The main difference in features compared to RSSI is that CSI has information on phase, direction of signals (out and in), delay (flight time), and power or amplitude.Exploring CSI can open up opportunities, especially in changing those features when the position or activity of humans/objects changes in the area of interest.CSI is a top choice for device-free indoor localization [9], [10].

(p2.3) There are also some techniques in Wi-Fi sensing, e.g., ToF, where the main parameters are the traveling time of signals from the transmitter to the receivers and machine learning (ML).We will discuss using CSI, including its benefits, challenges/limitations, and prospective research directions.
## (s3) B. Wi-Fi Sensing vs. Other Localization Methods
(p3.0) Wi-Fi sensing employs the interaction between the Wi-Fi signals and a person/object inside an indoor environment to detect movement, track position, and even for the signal change in biological vital signs, i.e., breathing.The most fundamental advantage of Wi-Fi is that it is widely and readily available compared to other localization methods [11], [12]:

(p3.1) 1) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): Detecting change in position, orientation, and acceleration, IMU emphasized using sensors, i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes.Unlike RF-based, the IMU-based localization method can work without signal infrastructure.However, in the long run, the accumulated device error can reduce performance.

(p3.2) 2) Vision-based method: Camera and computer vision can reliably locate the target/object and recognize gestures and activities.The main drawback is related to the privacy-obstruction issue and is significantly affected by the magnetic field and calibration issues on preinstallation.Furthermore, the methods also need favorable lighting conditions.

(p3.3) 3) Acoustics localization: Positioning based on its ToF by using sound or audio signal.This method is suitable in the industrial setting with many metal objects.The challenges are in noise reduction from surrounding environment acoustics properties.4) Magnetic-field-based: A magnetic field can estimate position based on signal strength and orientation.Because of magnetic fields, it can easily be affected by metallic objects and variations in magnetic fields in the area of interest.
## (s4) C. Wi-Fi Sensing Advantages and Limitations
(p4.0) The advantage of Wi-Fi sensing is its applicability in directly implementing the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure.It also gives an advantage in the deployment cost, finegrained localization (especially using CSI), can locate multi-target, non-intrusive (device-free), and adaptability to environmental change.However, some limitations must be considered in developing Wi-Fi sensing-based indoor localization [13].

(p4.1) The first limitation is related to the accuracy.One limitation of Wi-Fi infrastructure is its limited access.The collecting of Wi-Fi data can also raise privacy concerns.The Wi-Fi operates in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, as the operational frequency of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands is also in the same frequency band, which signal interference might happen [4].Other concerns are limited range, signal analysis complexity, and environmental variation.Thus, the selection of Wi-Fi parameters, the system design, scale, and the performance requirement need to be harmonized so that the indoor localization system can be reliable and accurate.The main advantages and limitations concerning its implementation are presented in Table 1.
## (s7) A. Introduction to CSI
(p7.0) The disadvantage of traditional methods is that the devices must be attached to the object.On the other hand, CSI uses the spectrum change of signal in communication link properties, e.g., amplitude, phase, time, and power, to detect the change and combine it with the specific technique to predict human behavior or activities.

(p7.1) For the non-intrusive nature of the human behavior system, CSI is essential and top choice.Moreover, in Wi-Fi devices, CSI can also be extracted.Another parameter of Wi-Fi can also be used, especially for indoor localization, i.e., received signal strength indicator (RSSI).However, this parameter is known for its high fluctuation in nature and is also accurate enough for coarse localization.CSI is a more "grained" metric than RSSI.CSI can describe amplitude attenuation and phase shift well, which can be used as the foundation of human behavior and lead to indoor localization implementations.Furthermore, CSI can effectively recognize the basic vital signs of complex actions human or inhabitants' activities.The illustration of CSI-based human behavior/activities, which can also be further extended as the indoor localization scenario, is depicted in Figure 2. It also depicts that the target/object does not need to carry any device (device-free).The multipath effects caused by the person's activities can be represented as propagation mechanisms, e.g., reflection, diffraction, and scattering.Reflection is reflected signal from human and surrounding interactive objects (IOs), while diffraction is diffracted signal from the surfaces, while scattering is signals scattered by small objects or sharp edges IOs [6].

(p7.2) The core of CSI is multipath propagation, especially in an indoor environment where the signal extensively experiences these multipath effects.For instance, giving that  is the number of different path signals traveling from TX/Access Points (APS) to RX/Station (STA).From these different paths, the signal and delay attenuation at  th path are described as   and   , respectively.The frequency response of the channel ℎ() then can be expressed as [5]
## (s8) B. Importance of CSI in Wi-Fi Sensing for Indoor Localization
(p8.0) As CSI is the channel state information between transmitter and receiver, it poses a significant role in indoor localization methods.As it includes the signal's phase, amplitude, and frequency of the received signals, it can contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the indoor localization system.Some contributions of CSI for indoor localization are mentioned as follows [3], [5], [6].
## (s26) 1) Accuracy and Precision
(p26.0) Accuracy is the measurement of the distance between the estimated position and the actual one, while precision involves the closeness of a quantity in repetitive measurements across different instances.Accuracy signifies that the spread of outcomes remains consistent across multiple trials.Various factors like noise, obstacles, and multipath effects influence these.Consequently, it becomes crucial for the system to mitigate the influence of elements that diminish accuracy [1].An indoor localization system is considered reliable when it demonstrates high accuracy and precision.Thus, many research papers mainly concentrate on enhancing accuracy through diverse methods [26].
## (s29) B. Experiment setups and datasets
(p29.0) For evaluation purposes, essential components of the experimental setup include the configuration of access points (APs) and receivers.Various studies concerning indoor localization using Wi-Fi have utilized dedicated hardware such as Intel Wi-Fi Link 5300 Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Network Interface Card (NIC), Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210 Software Defined Radio (SDR), and chipsets like Atheros AR9390 or Atheros AR9580 [30], [31] The initial phase of developing a fingerprint-based localization technique involves the acquisition of a radio map.Various aspects of the radio map, such as the distance between reference points (RPs), the number of RPs used for training, or the positions of target points (TPs) concerning RPs, will impact the algorithm's performance.The authors in [32] provide the open CSI datasets for localization.
## (s33) 2) Signal complexity
(p33.0) Signal reflections, interference, and multipath fading contribute to the difficulty of accurately retrieving signal information.CSI-based indoor localization algorithms often exhibit complexity, requiring significant training data.This complexity presents challenges for costeffective and streamlined deployment.Furthermore, the high-dimensional characteristics of signal data can also interfere with the practical training of machine learning approaches [33], [35].
