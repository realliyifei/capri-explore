## (s5) Feature selection
(p5.0) According to Elyusufi et al. [11], the feature selection phase is a basic concept in machine learning that affects the performance of detection and classification, hence the features can provide a significant influence on the result.This phase can be done with a few techniques like using the spearman correlation test, dimensionality reduction, the markov blanket technique, and wrapper feature selection with support vector machine (SVM) [26].Furthermore, researchers can also choose many features that could be divided into multiple classes.Furthermore, they are inserted into the model to find the best class [18].Table 4 presents the results of the feature selection process from several studies which includes information about which features are important for training the model.The number of features varied ranging from 4 to 49 attributes.The most used feature is the features that can be obtained by the researcher without having permission from third-party software.Most of them are related to the number of followers, the number of following accounts, likes, profile pictures, status, posts, and account names.Table 4.

## (s6) Reference
(p6.0) Features selected Total Gupta and Kaushal [7] Received likes, likes, received comments, comments, tags, tag user, tags from other users, page tags, tags in comments, page tags in the comments section, tags by other users in the comments section, shared posts, wall posts, like wall posts, comments in wall posts, used applications.17 Elyusufi et al. [11] Status, followers, friends, favorites.

(p6.1) 4 Reddy [23] Profile ID, name, status, followers, friends, location, account creation date, shares, gender, language.Wang et al. [31] The average of mentions, emojis, stop words, topics, links, retweets, similar posts, post length, forwarded posts, and punctuations.
## (s10) 16
(p10.0) Cresci et al. [18] Profile feature (features consist of information in the follower's profile of the target account), timeline feature (information of tweets in the follower's timeline of the target account), relationships feature (features from accounts that has a connectiona with the target account's followers).
## (s11) 49
(p11.0) Sheikhi [1] Profile picture, followed accounts, whether the follower count is greater, and the number of posts.4 Purba et al. [15] Posts, following, followers, biography, link, length of description, the presence of a description, the presence of pictures, likes, comments, location, hashtags, keywords, followers, post similarities, posts per hour.17
## (s14) Machine learning model
(p14.0) Machine learning is used to perform the detection process of fake accounts on social media.The majority of research studies used more than one algorithm to find the best model.Combining 2 algorithms has been possible to increase the accuracy like a study conducted by Mohammad et al. [27].They combined a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an artificial neural networks (ANN) model.Another was by Khaled et al. [26] which integrated an SVM with an ANN model.[31] 1 Random forest [18], [20], [28], [30], [34], [36] 6 AdaBoost [18], [20], [28], [36] 4 XGBoost [28], [36] 2 SVM
