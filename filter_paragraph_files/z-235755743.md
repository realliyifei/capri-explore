## (s1) Preparation of Narrative Review
(p1.0) Unlike systematic reviews, there is no consensus among the researchers on the standard structure of a narrative review. 8 As a result, different formats have been followed in defining the approaches followed in preparing review, which may be organised in chronological order, with a summary of the history of research when clear trends are identified, or presented as a "conceptual framework", if the dependent and independent variables and relationships between them are identified. 9,10 Considering the context of this study, which focuses on the developments of healthcare infrastructure through Islamic civilization, two different approaches may be followed: narrating the developments through the timeline; or categorizing the infrastructural factors and discussing the developments. This study divided the contents into various infrastructural factors including types of care centers, human resources management, medical education system, and medical ethics, and discussed the developments related to these factors. Accordingly various databases including journals related to medicine and Islamic history were searched for relevant articles reflecting the developments in healthcare. A combination of keywords including Islamic history and medicine, healthcare, Islamic civilization and hospitals, Islamic medical literature, and ethics were used for searching relevant articles. In addition, few historical texts and literature, especially sayings from Quran and hadiths were used to interpret the developments in an Islamic context.
