## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Impact Craters are among the most studied features on Mars. They are structures formed by collisions of meteoroids with the Martian surface. Their importance stems from the wealth of information that detailed analysis of their distributions and morphology can bring forth. For example, statistics of crater sizes forms the basis for geological stratigraphy of Mars. In addition, knowledge of crater morphologies enables studies of a number of outstanding issues in Martian geomorphology, such as: the nature of degradation processes, regional variations in geologic material, and distribution of subsurface volatiles. Thus, surveying Martian craters is an important task in planetary research. What's more, Crater are perfect route historic points, which are utilized for exact movement estimation for landing control arrangement of planetary tests, for example, landscape relative route. Consequently, checking and measuring the craters on the planet of solar framework is an imperative work for planet science. Be that as it may, with vast volumes of picture information gained by tests of Moon, Mars, and different planets, manual pit recognition, index, and investigation have turned into a testing and tedious undertaking [2]. Along these lines, we require effective and dependable programmed crater discovery strategies.

(p0.1) Numbers of crater detection algorithms (CDAs) have been proposed over the last few decades to address the challenges involved [3].Today, as in the past, efficient crater detection in planetary images remains as a daunting task due to the following challenges. Challenge 1: Lack of distinguishing features. Craters, as a landform formation , lack strong common features distinguishing them from other landform formations. Their sizes differ by orders of magnitude. Their rims have often been eroded since their formation millions of years ago, resulting in shapes that depart significantly from circles. They frequently overlap, complicating the task of their separation from background. Challenge 2: Heterogeneous morphology in images. Planetary surfaces are not homogeneous where non uniform surface morphology frequently exhibits. Furthermore, planetary images may be taken at different lighting conditions, at different resolutions, and their quality varies so that even morphologically identical craters may have different appearances in different images. Challenge 3: Huge amount of sub kilometer craters in high-resolution planetary images. The size distribution of craters follows power-law; large craters that can be easily identified manually are rare and small sub kilometer craters are abundant.

(p1.0) J. R. Kim, J. P. Muller, and S. V. [3] propose that mechanized crater recognition calculation is exhibited which endeavors picture information. The calculation is quickly portrayed also, its application showed on an assortment of distinctive A. Oliva and A. Torralba, [15] propose a computational model of the acknowledgment of genuine scenes that sidesteps the division and the handling of individual items or locales. The methodology depends on a low dimensional representation of the scene, that they term the Spatial Envelope. They propose an arrangement of perceptual measurements (expectation, openness, harshness, development, toughness) that speak to the prevailing spatial structure of a scene. At that point, they demonstrate that these measurements may be dependably assessed utilizing phantom and coarsely restricted data. The model produces a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing enrollment in semantic classifications (e.g., avenues, roadways, and coasts) are anticipated shut together. The execution of the spatial envelope model demonstrates that particular data about article shape or character is not a necessity for scene arrangement and that displaying a comprehensive representation of the scene illuminates about its likely semantic classification.
