## (s3) B. Histogram-Based Locality-Preserving Contrast Enhancement [2]
(p3.0) In this method is proposed by Jeyong Shin,et al. [2] a. Locality condition is defined in image histogram by using the intensity level. The purpose of the locality condition is to re-alize a local Contrast Enhancement [2] b. Optimization Problem Formulation
