## (s2) Method
(p2.0) This study used the PRISMA process to investigate previous studies.Following the PRISMA guidelines, this study specifies a minimum number of items to be reported, and assesses the effectiveness of interventions of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.This method improves the transparency, rigor and credibility of this study [34].
## (s7) Universal analysis
(p7.0) (1) Country/region analysis A bibliometric analysis of the publications in each region was conducted to explore the research status, collaboration network, and impact of digital preservation of architectural heritage in a disaster cycle across different countries.Figure 3 depicts the collaborations and the number of publications in this field by country.Italy leads the field with 158 articles, accounting for 18.2% of  system in the world and continues to enhance its efforts to preserve cultural heritage [37].The US, with 25 cultural and 12 natural heritage sites, has developed multiple digital tools and platforms to record, monitor, and disseminate information about its heritage resources [38].While confronting common challenges and opportunities, this survey demonstrates that different countries have different priorities and strengths in the digital preservation of architectural heritage during the disaster cycle.In addition, a noteworthy observation is that the number of publications is positively correlated with the amount of cultural heritage possessed by each country.
## (s9) 3) Discipline analysis
(p9.0) The digital preservation of architectural heritage is a multidisciplinary and comprehensive research field that covers various topics.According to Fig. 5, the main disciplines involved in this field are Geoscience, Materials Science, and Environmental Science.

(p9.1) This implies that to protect architectural heritage from disasters, it is necessary to: (1) apply knowledge and methods from earth science, material science, and environmental science to analyze the geographical location, structural characteristics, and environmental impacts of    and selected 42 keywords with a minimum frequency of 13 to generate a keyword clustering map with 42 nodes, 477 links, and a total link strength of 1341.Among them, the co-occurrence frequency indicates the association between keywords, and the modularity optimization and smart local moving algorithms so as to assign keywords to different topics that then optimize the network layout.The color and size of the nodes are determined by the keywords, and the lines represent the distance and connection strength between the nodes, showing the relationships, differences, and development trends among different topics, as shown in Fig. 6 [40].According to the keyword clustering, four topics are identified: Model, Cultural heritage, Management, and Buildings.These keywords represent different aspects of architectural heritage conservation, such as disaster analysis, spatial modeling, data management, and heritage conservation.Cluster 1 (red) uses the keyword "Model", which discusses the impact of disaster types on architectural heritage and the application of corresponding DTech.Cluster 2 (green) uses the keyword "Cultural heritage", which focuses on architectural heritage as the core object and explores spatial models, data management, and reality technologies.Cluster 3 (blue) uses the keyword "Management", which is oriented towards information systems and related aspects, and studies the protection management of architectural heritage.Cluster 4 (yellow) utilizes the keyword "Buildings", which uses types of architectural heritage as the scale range and discusses the role of DTech in architectural heritage conservation and restoration.From an overall perspective of the clusters, the most frequent keywords are mainly related to architectural heritage and digitalization, among which "Cultural Heritage" ranks highest, with a frequency of 130 times and a total link strength of 236 times.This suggests that architectural heritage is the main theme, and covers aspects such as disasters, DTech, management, etc.Moreover, DTech runs through the whole process of architectural heritage conservation and is therefore an important core technology.

(p9.2) Using keyword burst analysis in CiteSpace, this paper investigated the research trends of the digital preservation of architectural heritage in a disaster cycle.This method detects keywords with a surge in citation frequency within a certain period, revealing research hotspots and frontiers.It also produces a timeline graph that displays keyword clusters and theme transitions across different years, visually depicting the evolution of keywords [41].Figure 7 shows that the high-frequency citation keywords are grouped into three periods by every 3 years.In the first-period keywords such as accuracy, calibration, and algorithm reflect the technical demands for the restoration and reconstruction of architectural heritage.For instance, Santagati [42] suggested using photographs to rapidly create 3D models of architectural heritage and examined the limits and potentials of the image-based modeling techniques of accuracy and algorithm.The second-period keywords such as vulnerability, aerial image, reconstruction, and architecture heritage mark the onset of the digital era in architectural heritage conservation.For example, Gabellone [43] employed LiDAR and satellite multispectral data to extract architectural archaeological features, so as to analyze urban morphology, reconstruct historical scenes, and increase public interest and involvement in architectural heritage.The third-period keywords such as resilience, terrestrial
## (s12) Pre-disaster: preventive "maintenance"
(p12.0) Pre-disaster, DTech can help predict and prevent disasters affecting heritage buildings and protect architectural heritage.Preventive measures can protect buildings from deterioration and threats of sudden and chronic disasters.DTech can be used to determine the time and type of disaster [50], monitor changes in building structures [51], identify vulnerable buildings [52], map disaster scenarios [53], and collect data [54] to plan in disaster-prone areas, so as to ensure the integrity of architectural heritage.
## (s18) Digital application
(p18.0) Data application is a presentation aspect of digital preservation.Digital presentation of architectural heritage affects value interpretation, virtual-real interaction, simulation and dynamic preservation.To better present architectural heritage, several researchers have constructed different technological tools.For example, Bugalia et al. [93] propose a mixed reality (MR) based interactive system that combines computer graphics and VR technologies for real-time monitoring of architectural heritage, which allows users to experience and interact with cultural heritage.Stroscio et al. [94] create thematic maps and analyze data on the properties and decay forms of building material loss to monitor material degradation, building loss and restoration information; the thematic maps also allow Stroscio et al. to query damage information in a parametric way.

(p18.1) As research in architectural heritage preservation gradually moves towards high fidelity and dynamic digital models, digital twin technology also shows great potential within this field.Francoe et al. [95] established a digital twin system through photogrammetry to build a digital preservation system for architectural heritage with databases, meta-universes, VR and gamification methods; as they have suggested their digital twin system should enhance users' auditory and visual experiences and can improve the perception of architectural heritage preservation.Ma et al. [96] took Taiwan's historical buildings as an example and applied the Unity3D platform to build an interactive old city neighborhood information model, which provides dynamic VR simulation of interactive buildings and environments.These technological tools not only enrich the presentation and content of architectural heritage, but also increase public participation and awareness of architectural heritage.

(p18.2) Based on the analysis of the potential of digital preservation of architectural heritage in the disaster cycle and the application of DTech in architectural heritage conservation, it is found that the preservation of architectural heritage follows the frame of "identifying problems-analyzing problems-solving problems", which can be specifically classified into the three steps of disaster pattern identification, architectural heritage awareness and digital preservation.As shown in Fig. 10, architectural heritage is vulnerable to disaster attacks and damages, DTech is like a protective shell to protect architectural heritage under the cycle of disasters by adopting vulnerability assessment, sustainability, resource allocation, model archive, and restoration through three phases of digital recording, digital preservation, and digital application.Our idea aims to identify architectural heritage risks and damage according to different types of disasters, to perceive architectural heritage value and significance, and to select suitable DTech for measures such as prevention, restoration and rehabilitation; by taking this approach, we believe that our idea should achieve the objective of protecting heritage architecture within disasters cycles and moreover, we hope that our idea should offer future research guidance within further investigations.
