## (s6) Graphene oxide/silver nanowires composites for EM Shielding
(p6.0) One of the first studies investigating graphene-AgNWsbased composite as the shielding material was published in 2015 [34].Herein, AgNWs were prepared in the form of networks by multistep drop-casting them on quartz substrates.Then, CVD-produced single-layered graphene (SLG) was placed covering only the half of AgNW network.Laser irradiation was applied with a pulse of 248 nm and Δτ of 25 ns, at a repetition rate of 10 Hz.These experiments proved that graphene perfectly protected AgNWs that were beneath the graphene layer.Both the shape and the size of NWs were intact.On the opposite, a severely damaged region of NWs was observed when laser irradiation was directly applied to the AgNWs surface.Herein, laser irradiation induced fragmentations and cutting of AgNWs.Even single-layer graphene created a protective thermal barrier that preserved NWs.

(p6.1) In another study, composites made of the AgNWs with a diameter between 15 and 35 nm, and a length of 15-25 μm and Hummer's method produced GO were studied [33].Large and small GO flakes were separated by centrifugation.The free-standing, sandwich films were prepared by vacuum deposition onto the porous membrane using the following deposition procedure: GO water dispersion was run through the membrane, then AgNWs were deposited, and GO was deposited one more time.Thus, GO/AgNWs/ GO hybrid films were peeled off from a membrane filter.For the chemical reduction of GO in the hybrid film, HI was used.The films were flexible and only 8 μm thick.The C/O ratio was 9 after reduction, while the Raman I D /I G ratio (1.4) revealed a large number of defects, and the electrical conductivity was 6.5 × 10 4 S m −1 when 35 wt% of AgNWs was in the film.Herein, the enhancement in the electrical conductivity and EMI shielding was assigned to the tight contact of the top and bottom graphene layers with the middle AgNW layer.Graphene layers blocked the contacts of AgNW with air and prevent their corrosion and oxidation.EMI SE for the film at the X-band (8.4-12 GHz frequency range) was: 17 dB for rGO, 24 dB with 10 wt% AgNW content, and 38 dB with 35 wt% AgNW loadings.EMI shielding mainly depends on the electrical conductivity of the sample.So, improved EMI shielding was a result of increased conductivity, while the main shielding mechanism was assigned to the absorption of EM.
