## (s3) Conclusions
(p3.0) While cell-based therapies are the clinical standard of care for a few conditions, such as HSCT for hematological disorders and epithelial cell transplantation for burns  and corneal disorders, many years of preclinical and clinical research will be required to bring novel stem-cell based therapies to the bedside (13).Recently, stem cell researches have found great public interest in Iran and different cell therapy projects have started in the country (4).The number of Iranian published papers in ISI scientific journals have dramatically increased from 15 papers in 2004 to 145 in 2011 (12).The current study revealed that despite rapid growth of basic stem cell research in Iran a small number of publications were related to their clinical applications.This may be due to many factors such as: complexity of cell manufacturing for clinical application, inappropriate facilities, insufficient human and financial recourses, safety concerns, lack of legislation and validated pre-clinical studies.The gap between basic scientists and clinicians is another obstacle in the way of clinical and translational stem cell research.To bridge this gap, we need someone with a medical background and basic science experience that is familiar with GMP rules and quality management system.In this model of collaboration the responsibility of each party has to be well defined and overlaps minimized.As seen in Tables 1  and 2, the most frequent cell type is BM-MSC.The safety and biological properties of MSC rapidly led to the investigation of their use in cell-based therapy by the middle of the 1990s.More than 260 clinical trials related to MSCs have been registered with the US NIH registry.Thus it is not surprising that these are the cells of interest in clinical trials (14).There are different protocols for isolation and expansion of BM-MSC in published trials, therefore, it is difficult to compare and contrast study outcomes.To address this problem, in 2006, the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) proposed minimal criteria to define human MSC for both laboratory-based scientific investigations and pre-clinical studies (15).In the current study, none of the published trials fulfilled these criteria for MSC characterization.Although these minimal criteria are intended for research purposes, it can be used to standardize different cell preparation protocols.Except for 3 articles, FBS have been used as serum supplements in culture protocols.When applicable, animal-derived reagents should be replaced by animal-free products.Human platelet lysate, autologous serum and pooled human serum have been suggested by different studies as alternatives to FBS (1,(16)(17)(18)(19).Another animal derived reagent that has been applied for cell detachment is Trypsin.TrypLE (Invitrogen) and TrypZean (Sigma-aldrich) have been suggested as two animal origin-free alternatives for porcine Trypsin (20).We have successfully utilized TrypLE for dissociation of BM-MSC, Adipose tissue derived MSC and Schwann cell and recommend it for clinical grade cell preparation (unpublished data).If animal products cannot be replaced, they should be sourced in a controlled and documented manner and from animals bred and raised in captivity in countries or geographic regions that have appropriate national health status, disease prevention, and control systems (The United States Pharmacopeial Convention 2008).According to the current European law and FDA regulations, cell-based products should be manufactured under principles of GMP when they are used in phase I studies (21).Only 6 articles noted that cell preparations had been performed in a clean room facility.It should be considered that establishment and maintenance of a clean room is a complex procedure that needs technical expertise and considerable financial support.Therefore, collaboration with an existing GMP facility may be more cost-effective for centers with limited resources (22).The final cell product to be administered, as well as the production process and materials used, should be subjected to quality control testing.The present study describes the status of clinical cell transplantation research in Iran.The authors suggest that more comprehensive studies should be conducted to make a detailed map of stem cell research in this country.The growing trend towards stem cell research and transplantation in this country will open new horizons for treatment of incurable diseases.However, this raises safety and ethical concerns that necessitate strict supervision by regulatory agencies.To reduce these concerns, Iranian council of stem cell technology was established in 2008.Its main goal is the promotion of clinical and translational stem cell researches in order to improve public health.The authors suggest that this council should play an active role in regulation of cell therapies.This can be achieved by collaboration with other regulatory bodies (such as Food and Drug Organization) and preparation of national guidelines for clinical cell transplantation.Financial limitations and sanctions are the main barriers against stem cell research and therapy in Iran.Sanctions increase purchasing cost and time because they prevent the direct purchasing of materials and equipment from the main suppliers that are located in foreign countries.On the other hand, clinical grade cell manufacturing needs clinical grade reagents, specialized instruments, strict quality testing, and proper facilities (i.e. a cleanroom).Therefore, the primary costs of cell transplantation are higher than other conventional therapies.To perform a cost-effective procedure, stem cell research priorities should be set by research centers, paying attention to health system priorities.In conclusion, joined multicenter research, international collaborations, establishment of national regulations, well designed preclinical studies, adhering to international standards, sharing of facilities and staff, and bridging the gap between basic and clinical research may improve quality and quantity of clinical cell transplantation research in Iran.
