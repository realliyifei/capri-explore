## (s1) Low-grade chronic inflammation and its links to psychiatric disorders like depression and stress
(p1.0) In recent years, a growing body of research has shed light on the intricate interplay between inflammation, stress, and depression.various psychiatric disorders, particularly depression.Central to this relationship is the concept of low-grade chronic inflammation, which has emerged as a key player in the development and exacerbation of psychiatric conditions.Low-grade chronic inflammation refers to a persistent, low-level activation of the body's immune system, often characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory molecules, such as cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) [18].Studies have shown an association between MDD research investigations observed and low-grade chronic inflammation [19,20].Additionally, chronic inflammation has been related to various metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity [21,22].Further, it is well-established that individuals who are obese and have insulin resistance (which is typically regarded as a pre-diabetic stage) are more susceptible to MDD than healthy individuals [23,24].Thus, these factors are interconnected through underlying physiological processes such as neuroinflammation, hormonal imbalances, and neurotransmitter dysregulation.It is necessary to understand the crucial links between these disorders.The pathophysiology of depression has a strong link.It is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation.Patients with severe depression had higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).Surprisingly, an increase in these cytokines is observed when the body is physically and psychologically stressed, thereby linking inflammation, stress, and depression.Fig. 1 showcases the underlying mechanism of depression that involves the immune system, endocrine system, inflammation, and certain neurotransmitters.
## (s4) The correlation of neuroinflammation, depression, and dementia with dysfunctional brain glucose metabolism
(p4.0) Glucose, as the primary energy source for the brain, fuels its intricate neural networks.Disruptions in glucose metabolism, such as insulin resistance or impaired glucose uptake, have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia.Under normal physiological conditions, an increase in glucose levels in the blood leads to insulin production in the pancreas.As a result, there is enhanced glucose transport to the tissues and the brain.Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose and glucose transporter-linked mRNA production in the brain [69].Glucose transporter types 1, 3, and 4 (GLUT 1, 3, and 4) carry the glucose to the functional areas of the brain.Thus, a functional deficit of glucose in the brain results from glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in the elderly and depressed subjects [70].Reduced glucose levels in the brain are linked to the loss of glycaemic control.Additionally, structural changes in the brain can influence the mental state.Furthermore, it leads to neuronal damage and neurodegeneration and can be linked to the structural basis for dementia [71].In older Mexican-Americans, a recent study found a substantial correlation between metabolic abnormalities and depressed symptoms, and it was hypothesized that insulin resistance is a key factor in this relationship [72].Metabolic abnormalities and depression symptoms are linked by a variety of processes.There is a relationship between significant depression in older persons and metabolic abnormalities, which can result in cerebrovascular disease and endothelial dysfunction [73].Hyperactivation of GSK-3 is caused by insulin resistance and metabolic problems, and it has been independently linked to serious depression in older persons and is also a target for the action of antidepressants [74].
## (s5) Identifying drug targets in the designing of a new generation of psychotropic drugs
(p5.0) There is a limitation in standard pharmacological treatment related to MDD and related disorders [100].Approximately 30 % of people with a MDD are unresponsive to antidepressants, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [101].

(p5.1) Moncrieff et al. [102] recently in a systematic review tried to clarify the relationship between serotonin activity and depression.The review found no evidence that people with depression have lower serotonin activity than people without depression.Additionally, the methods used to limit the availability of serotonin by depleting tryptophan did not always make the participants' moods worse.As a result, there is no strong evidence supporting the serotonin hypothesis that depression has a biochemical basis.The authors concluded that a more durable theory may be required because the serotonin theory of depression may not be empirically supported.
## (s6) Dietary targets and lifestyle modifications to combat inflammation, depression, and metabolic syndrome
(p6.0) Metabolic syndrome is a multifaceted pathophysiological condition primarily associated with an imbalance in calorie intake.Other factors like an individual's genetic/epigenetic makeup, the prevalence of inactive lifestyles with less physical activity, aging, hormonal imbalance, food quality and composition, and gut microbes also contribute to the development of MS.Recent research connected gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal illnesses to the gut microbiota.Consuming probiotics may be an option for treating and preventing anxiety and depression as dysbiosis and peripheral inflammation of the gut have been linked to the development of several mental illnesses, including anxiety and depression [62,133].

(p6.1) A healthy gut microbiota transmits brain signals via neuronal transmission, microglial activation, neurogenesis, and behavioral control pathways in both stable and stressful environments, according to another review by Limbana et al. [134].Changes in the gut microbiome can lead to the production of microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), causing inflammatory reactions.These signals are then relayed to the vagus nerve, which can result in behavioral changes.The review concluded that dietary decisions substantially impact the endocrine, immunological, and gastrointestinal systems, among other bodily systems.Whereas high-fat consumption leads to obesity and inflammation of body systems, a healthy diet and probiotics reduce anxiety and sadness by improving the gut flora.

(p6.2) Insulin resistance is a common symptom of most people with T2DM and one of the hallmark clinical aspects of MS [135].Studies have established that hereditary abnormalities in mitochondrial activity lower its capacity to oxidize fatty acids.As a result, patients with type 2 diabetes suffer insulin desensitization [136].Furthermore, obesity contributes significantly to insulin resistance in T2DM.It is well known that chronic, low-grade peripheral inflammation linked to obesity is a critical etiologic mechanism for suppressing insulin signaling (Fig. 6) [137].
