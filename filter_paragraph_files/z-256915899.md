## (s1) Research gap
(p1.0) Most of the studies surveyed above investigated DS and established its utility as a tool for language learning.Here, the utility of DS refers to the use of DS to nurture the language abilities of young learners.A review of DS could examine the utility, robustness and trustworthiness of previous research all of which are tied to the replicability of research.

(p1.1) Current studies often fail to demonstrate the robustness of their results, as they seem to lack reliability or validity reports.Low reliability means that the results of a study could be confounded with errors and are not highly trustworthy (Field, 2018).Consequently, there are increased chances of Type I and II errors when unreliable data is used in follow-up influential statistics such as t-test and ANOVA.In addition, if the result of studies cannot be replicated, then they could be biased or not generalizable (Marsden et al., 2018).

(p1.2) In this study, we first attempt to address gaps in understanding through a systematic investigation of research methods in DS studies on language learning of children, with the aim to facilitate its integration with current education curriculums.We will consider the research features of these studies to evaluate their research standards.Second, we examine how the DS studies are designed to seek evidence about the trustworthiness and replicability of the studies.The replicability of a study is influenced by factors such as the theoretical framework employed, the design of the studywhether it was an experimental or cross-sectional studyas well as the test instruments used, data analysis method and the type of data analyses.Replicability in research establishes how reliable the findings of studies are and indicates whether or not their results can be generalized (Marsden et al., 2018).Particularly, the demand for replication research has surged as language acquisition studies are increasingly challenged to prove their validity and reliability (Marsden et al., 2018).
## (s15) Research question two: investigation of research design
(p15.0) Research question two examined the research design of studies in the DS dataset.In comparison to the other language competencies, most DS studies tend to focus on the written abilities of children (n = 50).Coincidentally, there has been a wealth of literature beyond this comprehensive review that established the value of DS in improving the written work of children (see Chen & Liu, 2019).

(p15.1) We found that previous research investigated and supported the use of DS to facilitate the speech development of children (Hwang et al., 2016;Lestariyana & Widodo, 2018), and enhance their abilities to read and comprehend texts (Hamdy, 2017;Liu et al., 2019).

(p15.2) For instance, Hwang et al. (2016) examined the effects of DS on the speaking skills of children who were non-native speakers of English.They identified that the process of recording composed stories orally allowed learners to practice speaking in the target language, thereby enhancing their English-speaking performance, as well as their general learning achievement in English (Hwang et al., 2016).Similarly, Lestariyana and Widodo (2018) tested the effects of DS on the speech development of English-as-a-foreignlanguage speakers in an Indonesian primary school.They implemented DS as a pedagogical innovation with the aim to boost the confidence of students in speaking English.For their experiment, students were encouraged to narrate their personal digital stories.Eventually, Lestariyana and Widodo (2018) observed that the process of reviewing and editing their voice recording allowed the students to become more confident in speaking English.Furthermore, students were also observed to make use of the learned vocabularies, which include difficult and technical terms (i.e., "propagation", "pruning", and "weeding") to better express their ideas verbally in English (Lestariyana & Widodo, 2018).

(p15.3) In contrast, Liu et al. (2019) studied the effects of DS on the reading skills of elementary school students.They observed that the students became proficient in oral reading through participation in the DS intervention (Liu et al., 2019).Concurrently, the DS intervention fostered a collaborative language learning environment, which encouraged students' engagement and sustained their learning progress (Liu et al., 2019).Likewise, Hamdy (2017) identified that the use of DS to teach students reading comprehension achieved better outcomes than conventional modes of instruction.Specifically, he noted that DS approaches combine visual images with written text to enhance and accelerate the students' abilities to read (Hamdy, 2017).

(p15.4) However, there are some limitations to the preceding studies with respect to research design.First, these studies have not utilised any theoretical framework to examine the issue rigorously and systematically.Thus, their findings appear to lack theoretical basis and explanatory power.In addition, we observed that some studies attempted to demonstrate the effects of DS on the children's motivation to learn languages or other intangible factors.
## (s16) Research question three: reporting of reliability
(p16.0) An overwhelming majority of the studies in the DS dataset (92%) have not reported the reliability of test instruments and the results achieved.As mentioned earlier, the exclusion of reliability analysis is another factor that affects the robustness of DS studies.

(p16.1) Concurrently, it hinders the accurate inference of research outcomes (Grabowski & Oh, 2018).Moreover, DS researchers were more likely to focus on reporting internal reliability of instruments used, whereas only one research paper analysed external reliability.
