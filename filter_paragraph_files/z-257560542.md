## (s1) Methods
(p1.0) This review was prospectively registered in PROS-PERO (Registration Number: CRD42021209994), and reported in line with PRISMA 2020 guidance [18] and the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool [19]. For each database, a date limit of 2012-2023 was set. When available, subject headings identified from the controlled vocabulary of each database were also included in the search. On January 11 th 2023, a Google Scholar search was conducted for the search term 'Paternal preconception' , applying the filter to limit articles published since 2022 and searching through to page seven, identifying any other recently published relevant papers. Google Scholar was also used to identify relevant studies citing each included paper. Reference lists of each included paper were then checked for additional relevant studies.
## (s5) Quality assessment
(p5.0) The quality of each paper was assessed by TC using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The NOS comprises three domains 1) selection of participants, 2) comparability of study groups, and 3) outcome of interest (cohort studies) or ascertainment of exposure (casecontrol studies), assigning stars in each domain to a maximum of nine stars [21]. Papers were then categorized as good quality (7-9 stars), fair quality (4-6 stars) or poor quality (0-3 stars) using groupings employed in previous research [22].

(p5.1) A meta-analysis was considered, but not possible due to exposure and outcome heterogeneity. Males who identified as being the partner of the pregnant women and/or the biological father of the child for which outcomes were reported Exposure to modifiable risk factor(s) in the preconception period No exposure to modifiable risk factor(s) in the preconception period (or comparison group as defined by individual studies)
## (s6) Results
(p6.0) A total of 65 papers were included in this review ( Fig. 1 -PRISMA Flowchart) [18], comprising cohort (n = 56) and case control studies (n = 9) ( Table 2 -Summary Table) & (Table 3 -Summary Table Findings). The majority of papers were conducted in the USA (n = 18), Europe and the UK (n = 19), and China (n = 17), several papers were from Australia [23][24][25][26][27][28][29] or included an Australian health centre [30][31][32][33][34]. Approximately half of all papers (n = 29) included a sample size between 370 and 2,900, while others included > 20,000 (n = 11) or ≤ 200 participants (n = 13). Study participants were diverse consisting of couples either intending pregnancy or pregnant (n = 25), sub-fertile and seeking fertility treatment undergoing IVF/ICSI (n = 11), or mothers and fathers of infants (n = 26). Two studies included adolescents followed into parenthood as adults [42,80], and one study included individual respondents of a national family growth survey, actively attempting pregnancy [59].

(p6.1) Modifiable preconception risk factors and/or health behaviour exposures examined include paternal body composition (n = 25), alcohol intake (n = 6), cannabis use (n = 5), physical activity (n = 2), smoking (n = 20), stress (n = 3), and nutrition (n = 13) (including dietary folate intake and consumption of foods and dietary patterns). Two papers investigated multiple exposures [42,43].          
## (s13) Alcohol
(p13.0) Six papers examined alcohol as an exposure [26,42,43,[55][56][57]; three rated as good quality [42,55,56]. Excluding one, each paper used paternal self-reports of alcohol consumption with varying definitions; one article specified units/per week [43], the others assessed consumption more broadly either as intake ≥ 1/week [56], ≥ 1/month [42] or general intake [57]. A single study presented a maternal report of paternal preconception alcohol consumption, 3 months before conception, at 12-16 weeks gestation [55].

(p13.1) When examining an outcome of offspring anogenital distance (AGD), in the paternal alcohol-exposed group (> 81 g/wk), male offspring had shorter mean AGDs [56]; for AGD-AP [the centre of the anus to the cephalad insertion of the penis] at birth (β =-1.73, P = 0.04) and 12 months (β = -7.29, P = 0.05), and shorter mean AGD-AS [the centre of the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum] at 6 months (β =-4.91, P = 0.02) [56]. Female offspring had shorter mean AGD-AF [ the centre of the anus to the posterior convergence of the fourchette) (β = -0.72, P = 0.02) at birth yet longer mean AGD AC [the centre of the anus to the clitoris] (β = 2.81, P = 0.04) and AGD-AF (B = 1.91, P = 0.04) at 12 months [56]. Further, the relative risks of anxiety or depression were increased by 33% (RR = 1.33 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.61]) and 37% (RR = 1.37 [95% CI: 1.02,1.84]) among girls in the exposed group at ages 4 and 6, respectively [55]. Paternal alcohol consumption greater than once per month was not associated with offspring birthweight or gestational age [42].
## (s14) Cannabis
(p14.0) Paternal cannabis exposure was assessed in five papers [42,[58][59][60][61], two rate as good quality [42,60]. Each paper has a sample size < 1,200 and each utilized paternal selfreporting of cannabis use broadly assessing general use, rather than specific amounts, over a pre-determined period (i.e., last 2 months or 12 months).

(p14.1) In sub-fertile couples undergoing IVF/ICSI, compared to males who were past or never cannabis users, couples where the male partner used cannabis at enrolment had increased probability of implantation (77.9, [95% CI: 53.5, 91.5], P = < 0.05) and live birth (47.6, [95% CI: 32.4, 63.3], P = < 0.05), independent of women's cannabis use [60]. Clinical pregnancy was not associated with male cannabis use [60], nor was gestational age or offspring birthweight [42].
## (s15) Physical activity
(p15.0) The associations of paternal physical activity with offspring outcomes were assessed in two papers [42,43], one rated as good quality [42]. This study found no association between paternal preconception bouts of physical activity per week and gestational age or offspring birthweight [42].
## (s17) Stress
(p17.0) Paternal stress exposure was examined in three papers [43,76,77]; including one rated as good quality [77]. This study found men's baseline perceived stress scale [PSS] scores were not associated with fecundability [77].
## (s18) Nutrition
(p18.0) Papers examining paternal nutrition (n = 13) evaluated the associations of a range of nutritional exposures including paternal preconception folate, vitamins B6 and B12, and general dietary patterns with numerous offspring outcomes. These papers utilized data from several studies (n = 8) originating in the US, Norway, The Netherlands, and Australia. Approximately half of these papers (n = 7) rated as good quality.

(p18.1) Paternal nutritional factors explored included dietary patterns [82,83] or specific foods groups including dairy [86], and meat [87]. IVF/ICSI-induced live birth was an outcome examined in three papers [82,86,87]. A positive association was found between paternal poultry intake and fertilization rate, with a higher fertilization rate among men in the highest quartile of poultry intake [78%] compared with those in the lowest quartile [65%] [87]. Men's total dairy intake was not associated with fertilization rate, implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, or live birth rate [86]. Also, paternal adherence to specific dietary patterns [pattern 1 = greater intake of processed foods/meats/high fat/dairy/sugar; pattern 2 = greater intake of fruit/vegetables/legumes/whole grains/nuts/ fish] was not associated with fertilization rate [82] when undergoing IVF cycles.

(p18.2) One paper investigated dietary exposures during adolescence and subsequent neonatal health [80]. In a sample of adolescents followed into adulthood becoming fathers (n = 2,140), an extra serving of fruit per week was associated with a 2.35 g increase in offspring placenta weight [95% CI: 0.284, 4.42], P = 0.03 [80]. Further, paternal lunching regularly in adolescence was associated with an increase in offspring head circumference (β = 0.160, [95% CI: 0.001, 0.320], P = 0.05) and whole grain bread consumption was associated with a lower ponderal index (β = -0.003, [95% CI: -0.005, -0.001], P = 0.01) [80]. Birthweight was not associated with any paternal dietary exposures [80].

(p18.3) Generally, paternal preconception dietary patterns were collected through paternal self-reports on standardised food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) at baseline and include fast foods [42]; males eating fast food more frequently had infants born earlier than men who eat fast food less frequently (-0.16, [95% CI: − 0.32, 0.00], P = 0.04) [42].
