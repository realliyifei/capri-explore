## (s3) Search strategy
(p3.0) The report followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [27].A comprehensive search of both peer-and non-peer-reviewed articles from online bibliographic databases and grey literature search using relevant MeSH words or subheadings of keywords was conducted in May 2022.

(p3.1) Studies of community engagement as a health intervention for the support of mental well-being among children and mothers experiencing housing insecurity were identified from five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Global Health and Child Development & Adolescent Studies).
## (s5) Screening and selection
(p5.0) All retrieved titles and abstracts were reviewed by one reviewer (NJ) with a second reviewer independently screening 12% of eligible studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria (JA).The interrater reliability was deemed to be in fair agreement (Cohen's Kappa = 0.31) for the title and abstract screenings [33].The third reviewer (A-MB) independently resolved conflicts with planned discussions.Full texts of all eligible articles were retrieved and screened by one reviewer (NJ) using the eligibility criteria and excluded with reason.
## (s6) Data extraction
(p6.0) Data were extracted based on study characteristics (study aims, sample, methods, outcomes).The intervention characteristics (e.g., study context, intervention reason, intervention details, location of intervention, intervention deliverer) were extracted using the TIDieR checklist to standardise the reporting of the intervention [34,35] (Appendix
## (s12) Level of community engagement
(p12.0) The extraction of community engagement characteristics aims to identify the level of community involvement   within stages of the intervention such as the design and planning of the intervention, the delivery, and the intervention evaluation (Table 6).Categorising involvement was based on O'Mara-Eves et al., (2013) extraction tool which identified six levels of involvement: leading, collaborating, consulted, informed, and not involved (or not clear).Two studies maintained high levels of community engagement at each stage of the intervention [39,40].

(p12.1) The majority of studies relied on informing-based delivery of community engagement.Low levels of community engagement are involved in the designing and planning phase of the intervention with only two UK studies providing evidence of community engagement at preliminary stages [39,40].
## (s20) Process evaluation of intervention
(p20.0) Eight out of the 10 studies contained a process evaluation of the intervention.Table 9 summarises the process evaluation across the included studies.The process evaluation identifies the nature of delivery and adherence to the intervention to understand the effectiveness of the intervention for the target population.Four studies analysed the participants' fidelity to the intervention.Four studies analysed the acceptability and satisfaction of the intervention.Bradley et al. (2020) adopted a mixture of questionnaires and qualitative interviews to determine the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.Three studies identified training provided to interventionists (care managers and primary care physicians).No study provided an evaluation of cost-effectiveness.Seven studies provided information about the sources of funding from charities (n = 1) and research/state grants (n = 6).Nabors et al. ( 2004) evaluated acceptability and accessibility process variables using questionnaires given to children and teachers respectively [44].Gewirtz et al. (2015) identified fidelity to intervention using attrition analysis of the participant follow-ups and identified no significant differences between the intervention group and control [41].Fidelity to community, counselling or medical services was identified using a structured review in Lee et al. (2010) [42].Brown et al. (2020) reported high satisfaction rates with the implementation and planning of an intervention, but lower ratings were given for participant involvement in the intervention planning [40].Bradley et al. (2020) provided the perspectives of mothers living in hostels on the appropriateness of the adapted intervention content and feasibility within the environment [39].
## (s24) Personal outcomes
(p24.0) Maternal indicators for personal outcomes included self-efficacy, financial stress, transitioning out of homeless shelters, and health literacy.Eight positive findings were identified out of ten personal outcomes across the included studies (self-efficacy, financial stress, communication, family unity and transitioning out of homeless shelter and health literacy for sub-group analysis) (Table 12).Studies included overall findings which identified outcome changes when combining both the intervention and comparator groups.Brown et al., (2020) identified an overall non-significant finding for health literacy post-intervention however upon sub-group analysis, the health literacy among mothers that had low health literacy at baseline had significant improvement in health literacy at follow-up (p = 0.003) [40].
## (s30) Strengths and limitations
(p30.0) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rapid review which looks at the impact of community engagement for single mothers and children experiencing housing insecurity.Consequently, the review provides insight for primary research to integrate community engagement within health interventions to better support vulnerable mothers and children.The combination of the O'Mara-Eves et al. (2013) conceptual framework, social-ecological model and maternal-child relationship provides the theoretical tools to disentangle the multivariate influences and illuminate intervention pathways for health outcomes.The basis of the rapid review captured a broad spectrum of studies from various settings such as social services, school-based environments, non-clinical health centres and shelters.The different settings reflect the potential service entry points that single mothers facing housing insecurity may encounter [61,62].

(p30.1) The review aimed to rigorously search for relevant papers from extensive sources.However, there is a possibility that relevant titles may be unintentionally missed due to publication bias and the ambiguous and varied terminology surrounding community engagement.In addition, the team capacity, funding and time frame to conduct the search and screening is shorter than 12 months in comparison to other community engagement systematic review studies which may contribute to further omission and potential selection bias [63,64].Furthermore, due to the nature of the rapid review there is a risk of unintentional omission during screening.

(p30.2) Most papers were conducted in the USA and only two were in the UK.Consequently, the generalisability of results from the review is limited, especially concerning the power dynamics between institutions, governmental bodies and communities, funding structures and available resources.Therefore, public health practitioners and policymakers should interpret the results with caution by considering the contextual sensitivities in areas they aim to support.
