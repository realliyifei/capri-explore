## (s61) Format & Decide Content
(p61.0) The final step at this stage is to formulate the explanation. Once again, we need to consider each of our audiences one at a time. Our main goal here is to map the knowledge extracted from our system onto the user's mental model. To do this, we must first consider the right format to deliver our explanations. This could be text, images and so on. Quite recently, Sokol and Flach [2018] even proposed a voice-enabled system where users can have a dialogue with the system that would then explain its decisions in a way the user understands.

(p61.1) In addition to the format of explanations, we must also consider its content. In stage II (Negotiation), we identified the level of explanation suitable for each of our audiences based on their level of understanding of the subject matter as well as the kind of explanations needed to satisfy them.
