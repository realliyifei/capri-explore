## (s1) Description of the condition
(p1.0) The female body changes during pregnancy to create a favorable environment for fetal development which may result in musculoskeletal disorders [1,2] and painful symptoms [3], especially in the lumbopelvic region [4]. Mechanical and hormonal factors may cause morphophysiological changes during pregnancy and induce dysfunctions in the lumbopelvic region [5]. The lumbopelvic pain (LPP) includes low back (LBP) or pelvic girdle pain (PGP) or both and is the most common [1], severe, and incapacitating complaint [6] during pregnancy.

(p1.1) Approximately 10% to 21% of pregnant women report severe and incapacitating LPP. Moreover, 50% to 70% of pregnant women present LBP and 10% to 65% have PGP [7]. LPP impacts quality of life [8], causing functional disability [9] and affecting activities of daily living [1]. Also, some pregnant women present pain reduction after childbirth, while 5% to 8.5% report pain up to two years after childbirth [10].
## (s3) How the intervention will work
(p3.0) Exercise is a planned, structured, and repetitive physical activity for body conditioning [8] that has greater positive effect on severity of LBP than usual care [16]. Exercises for pregnancy-related LBP are similar to those for non-specific LBP [17]. For example, walking, lowimpact aerobic exercise, and adapted yoga and pilates are safe physical activities for pregnancy [13].

(p3.1) Regular physical activity during pregnancy promotes health benefits, such as decreased frequency of gestational diabetes mellitus, prevention of preeclampsia, and improved recovery time during postpartum [13]. Exercise may also reduce pain intensity and disability and improve global functioning [14,18].
## (s16) Assessment of risk of bias in the included studies
(p16.0) Review authors (SORL and VPSS) will independently assess risk of bias in each study using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [19]. Disagreements will be solved through consensus or involving a third review author (ESRV).

(p16.1) Risk of bias will be assessed according to the following domains: Random sequence generation (selection bias): description of the method used to generate allocation sequence to verify whether it should produce comparable groups. Any important concerns about other possible sources of bias will be described and classified as low, high or unclear risk of bias.

(p16.2) Allocation concealment (selection bias): description of the method for allocation concealment before assignment, and assessment of whether allocation to intervention could have been foreseen before or during recruitment or changed after assignment.
## (s21) Dealing with missing data
(p21.0) Investigators or study sponsors will be contacted to verify key characteristics of the study and obtain missing numerical data when possible (e.g., when only the abstract is identified). Unsuccessful contacts and missing data introducing serious bias will also be considered for GRADE rating [20].
