## (s1) EMA & EMI
(p1.0) Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) referred to the sampling of users' experiences in real time [9]. Relatedly, Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) referred to intervening in the users' life in the context of their everyday lives [10]. EMA and EMI were combined with other theoretical approaches. For instance, in one study, EMA was combined with CBT and ACT to sample users' moods and then provide them with psychological interventions, such as CBT-based exercises [11].
