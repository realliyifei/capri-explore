## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Increasing burden of obesity, MetS, T2DM, and CVD in developing countries has created an urgent need for more researches on the various factors responsible for increasing their prevalence [1][2][3][4]. MetS has generated much concern over the past few years because it clearly represents a high risk for developing diabetes type 2 and cardiovascular diseases. Hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and physical inactivity are the main risk factors of MetS [5][6][7], but its association with other interrelated factors is still unknown.

(p0.1) Although it's suggested that the improvement of economic situation, nutrition transition, and increased urbanization in developing countries play the important roles in increasing prevalence of obesity and the MetS [1,[8][9][10][11][12][13], more researches is needed to confirm these suggestions. Greater efforts are also needed to properly diagnose other affecting environmental and genetic factors in order to find out the basic mechanisms which lead to the susceptibility of individuals to the MetS [14][15][16][17]. It is well documented now that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increasing worldwide. However, it seems that not only its prevalence in some geographic regions and ethnic groups is higher than others but also the patterns of its related components are widely different [18].

(p0.2) In this article, we reviewed the criteria and risk factors of MetS and then discussed its prevalence in the Middle East countries. After that we compared the prevalence of the syndrome and its underlying factors between some of the Middle East and some of the European countries and finally discussed in brief about other probably influencing factors on metabolic syndrome or its related components.
## (s7) Risk Factors
(p7.0) Nutritionally-related pattern have changed considerably in the Middle East countries during recent years because of social development in the absence of steady economic growth and changes in dietary and physical activity pattern [30]. Bear all these facts in mind, the main risk factors of the MetS are the followings:
## (s8) Insulin resistance
(p8.0) Insulin resistance, implying depressed cellular sensitivity to insulin [31], is present in the majority of people with the MetS which strongly associates with other metabolic risk factors and also CVD risk [32].

(p8.1) The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus defines impaired fasting glucose as >100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) but <126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) and impaired glucose tolerance as 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test values >140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) [33].
## (s9) Obesity
(p9.0) "Obesity epidemic" is considered by ATP III as mainly responsible for the increasing prevalence of MetS [32]. Obesity has been strongly associated with insulin resistance [34], T2DM [35] and the MetS [36] and higher CVD risk [32]. Since there is a strong connection between abdominal obesity and metabolic risk factors , ATP III defined the MetS as a clustering of metabolic complications of obesity [32].

(p9.1) It is claimed that intra-abdominal fat and visceral adipose tissue are strongly associated with insulin resistance and therefore the MetS than other adipose tissue compartments [37,38]. It is noteworthy to mention that, several studies declared that subcutaneous truncal fat plays an important role in insulin resistance [39][40][41][42].

(p9.2) Researchers suggest that sensitivity of individuals to changes in body fat is genotype-dependent [43,44]. Some results identified quantitative trait loci with significant effects on adipocyte-derived protein and revealed the emergence of a consistent pattern of linkage results for obesity-related traits across a number of human populations [45]. Also it is suggested that genetic factors explain 50 to 90% of the variance in BMI in twins and estimates of parent-offspring and sibling correlations in agreement with heritabilities of 20 to 80% is generally reported [46]. Common genetic polymorphisms are important determinants of obesity [47,48], such as the Trp64Arg variant in the Beta-3 adrenergic receptor gene and the Val103Ile variant in the MC4R receptor [49].

(p9.3) Among different countries in the Middle East region there is significant heterogeneity in obesity prevalence [50]. In Iran the prevalence of obesity was shown to be 22.3% among adults (30.6% in females and 14.2% in males) [51]. In 2005, among urban Iranians aged 15-70 years the prevalence rate was between 22% and 40% [52]. As reported in these studies, Iranian females have a higher prevalence of obesity compared to men. In other Middle East countries such as Saudi Arabia (24% in females and 16% in males, age ≥ 15 years) [53], Oman (23.8% in females and 16.7% in males, age ≥ 20 years) [54], Lebanon (18.8% in females and 14.3% in males, age ≥ 20 years) [55] and Turkey (24.6% vs. 14.4% in males, age ≥ 20 years) [56] the prevalence is higher in women the same as Iran.
## (s12) Other risk factors
(p12.0) Some research suggest that various factors such as rapid nutrition transition [1,85], rural-to-urban migration [1,7,[86][87][88][89], increasingly sedentary occupations and life style such as smoking [6,[90][91][92][93], and maternal-fetal factors [1] may influence the prevalence rate of the MetS and obesity. In one survey, it was revealed that a Mediterraneanstyle diet might play a role in reducing the inflammatory state and endothelial dysfunction associated with the MetS [94]. Moreover, the diet reduced the components of the syndrome and the overall prevalence of the MetS was reduced by approximately one half [94]. Additionally, it was found that the prevalence of diabetes, obesity, hypertension and MetS decreased with high educational levels [95][96][97][98][99][100].
## (s13) Epidemiology of the Metabolic Syndrome in the Middle East Countries
(p13.0) The MetS is increasing in line with the rising prevalence of obesity in developing countries. High prevalence of the MetS has been reported from the Middle East countries; Iran [119], Turkey [120], Saudi Arabia [121,122], and United Arab Emirate [123] ( Table 2). The prevalence rates are also high in Egypt [124], Qatar [125], Jordan [126,127] and Lebanon [128].  There is a paucity of data on prevalence of the MetS from other Middle East countries: Kuwait, Omani, Cyprus, Bahrain, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Palestine.
## (s14) Author and year
(p14.0) In a study done among Iranian adults, the overall prevalence of the MetS was 32.1%, 33.2% and 18.4% according to IDF, ATP III and WHO, respectively [129]. The result of another Iranian survey indicated the higher prevalence of the MetS in women, in urban areas, and in the 55-to 64-year age-group compared with the prevalence in men, in rural areas, and in other age-groups, respectively by NCEP/ATP III, IDF and modified ATP III/AHA/NHLBI definitions [119,130]. High socioeconomic status of family, medical history of parents and dietary habits were influencing factors in the prevalence of the MetS in Iran [131]. Furthermore, the prevalence is higher in Iranian women compared with men [5,130,132].
## (s15) Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in Some of European and American Countries
(p15.0) In most countries, between 20% and 30% of the adult population can be characterized as having the MetS and it is even higher in some populations or segments of the population [39,141]. With increasing affluence and aging of the population, the prevalence rises undoubtedly [141].

(p15.1) In a cohort study done among European youth, the prevalence of MetS was 0.2% and 1.4% in 10-and 15-y-olds, respectively [142]. They declared that some factors like high maternal BMI, low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity independently contribute to the MetS and small increases in physical activity may significantly diminish the risk of MetS in healthy children [142].
## (s16) Conclusion and Suggestions
(p16.0) Prevalence of the MetS and its components has shown a rapid rise in developing countries in the past few decades leading to increased risk of CVD and consequent morbidity and mortality. For this reason, there is an urgent need to develop better approaches in order to prevent and manage the syndrome and strike at the underlying causes.

(p16.1) The pattern of the components of metabolic syndrome varies in the Middle East region in comparison with Europe and North America. In addition to differences of diet behaviors, the genetic factors and some of geographic dependent elements may influence the variation of metabolic syndrome architecture worldwide particularly in the Middle East region. Therefore, the study of differences between for example; gastrointestinal microbiomes and obviously the regional prevalent nutro-microorganisms, the European people and Middle Eastern individuals is recommended.

(p16.2) Both genetic and environmental factors seem to contribute to MetS prevalence. Studies have shown that genetic factors play a significant role in the prevalence of MetS risk factors. It is suggested that sensitivity of individuals to changes in body fat are genotypedependent. Also insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are multi-factorial in origin with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to their development. Moreover, the intersection of both lipid abnormalities and hypertension involving some of genetic and environmental factors is of special interest in some families. Genetic component also affects the individual habitual physical activity level by some indications and the propensity toward being spontaneously active could be partly influenced by the genotype.

(p16.3) As populations differ in prevalence of many complex genetic diseases which are probably influenced by the level of gene expression [154][155][156][157][158], we suggest that more researches should be done on allele frequency differences at regulatory polymorphisms which may account for some differences in prevalence of MetS.
