## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the genus Henipavirus (HNV; family Paramyxoviridae) that causes acute and severe respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans (Escaffre et al., 2013). Rockx et al., (2012) reported that several outbreaks of NiV have been identified in Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh and India since 1998. No new outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia and Singapore since 1999 (WHO).

(p0.1) Their unique genetic constitution, high virulence and wide host range set them apart from other paramyxoviruses. These features led to their classification into the new genus Henipavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae and to their designation as Biosafety Level 4 pathogens (Eaton et al., 2006).
