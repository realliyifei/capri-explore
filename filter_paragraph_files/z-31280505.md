(p12.0) Having reviewed both the legal and technological developments involving child pornography, we now extend our examination to digital forensics as it applies to this subject.It is not only the criminals who take advantage of modern and accessible information technology, but law enforcement also uses technology to investigate and apprehend online sexual exploiters.During investigations, law enforcement must assess if an image is that of an actual child.Because of ongoing advancements in image creation and editing tools, it has become difficult to visually distinguish between real and fake images.For this reason, the field of digital forensics and its use in child pornography cases is developing rapidly.
