## (s2) Materials and Methods
(p2.0) An integrative review of the literature was performed using parameters outlined by Russell [13] with the purpose of summarizing and synthesizing current literature on the multitude of effects on climate change and mental health.We identified the following research question: how might mental health be impacted by climate change and what are the mechanisms by which this happens?A search strategy was created that involved terms related to climate change, such as 'global warming', 'natural disaster', 'and 'climate', as well as terms related to potential impacts on mental health, such as 'depression', 'PTSD', 'suicide' and 'violence'.Three databases (PsycINFO, PubMed and SCOPUS) were searched.In order to be deemed eligible, studies needed to present primary data, be published in English in peerreviewed journals, have a high impact factor or be well-cited.While we focused our search on literature that was published in the last five years, we also included studies published earlier if highly relevant and well-cited.We excluded studies that were not well-cited or had a low impact factor.Conference papers, dissertations, letters and opinion pieces were also excluded.Thematic analysis was used to explore patterns that emerged in the literature.
## (s7) Internalizing and Externalizing Mental Health Behaviors
(p7.0) As outlined above, acute, subacute and chronic consequences of climate change are associated with a variety of negative sequelae, such as increased psychological distress, mental health-related emergency room visits and admissions, suicide, depression, anxiety and development of disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).As outlined in Table 1, the literature focuses primarily on identifying the course of mental health changes following extreme weather-related events, which may result in conditions such as PTSD, depression, anxiety and suicidal behavior.Internalizing behaviors are negative behaviors that focus inwardly towards the self, such as depression, anxiety, social withdrawal and suicide, whereas externalizing behaviors are negative behaviors that are directed outward toward others such as aggression, opposition, defiance and violence [33].
## (s11) Proposed Mechanisms of Climate Change-Related Depression
(p11.0) The pathogenesis for depression is complicated, partially understood and multifactorial, including genetic, psychosocial and environmental factors [64].The neurobiology of depression may be attributed to both structural and neurochemical changes in the brain, specifically as diminished prefrontal cortex regulation of the amygdala, hippocampus and hypothalamus coupled with dysregulation in the noradrenergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways [64].Studies have shown harmful environmental exposures from airborne pollutants such as diesel, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3) and particulate matter can alter neurotransmitter function, both in the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways [64][65][66], with implications for many psychiatric illnesses, including depression.Additionally, it is believed that exposure to stress, whether in acute climate change related events such as hurricanes or indirect effects from chronic climate change such as food insecurity or poverty, also increase the risk of depression [64].Furthermore, climate change has direct neurobiological effects due to heat exposure and the subsequent increase in inflammation that is associated with greater likelihood of developing depression [64].While there is a relatively large knowledge base examining climate change and the mechanisms by which cognition is affected, little research has been conducted examining the neurobiological implications climate change may have on depression.Future research should observe specific causal pathways of exposure to climate change-related events and neurobiological changes resulting in depression.
