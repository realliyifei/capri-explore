## (s1) Air Purifiers
(p1.0) People spend most of their time indoors [45]. Because outdoor air pollution infiltrates into buildings, "indoor air" contains both indoor-and outdoor-generated pollution [46]. Indoor exposures account for 61% and 81% of the deaths attributed to outdoor-generated PM 2.5 in the USA and China, respectively [47,48]. Thus, reducing PM 2.5 indoors may also mitigate the impacts of outdoor-generated particles.
## (s2) Facemasks
(p2.0) Unlike air purifiers, facemasks have the potential to reduce exposure in multiple indoor and outdoor locations. We use the term "facemask" to include a range of materials worn on the face including improvised masks (t-shirts, handkerchiefs, bandanas, etc.) [69], procedure or surgical masks, and air purifying respirators designed for occupational settings [70].
## (s4) Staying Indoors and Closing Windows
(p4.0) Air pollution dose is influenced by concentration and breathing rate, so changing locations and activities may be beneficial [33]. During pollution episodes, government and public health agencies often recommend reducing outdoor activities, particularly for susceptible groups [81,82].
## (s5) Travel Modes and Routes
(p5.0) Travel can disproportionately impact exposure to trafficrelated air pollution (TRAP) [92,93]. TRAP concentrations are highly variable and several cities have online tools to help commuters select routes with less air pollution. Travel mode can also be important because it influences travel route and duration, breathing rate, and the degree of protection from ambient pollution.
## (s6) Vehicle Ventilation and Filtration
(p6.0) By 2017, there was substantial evidence that in-vehicle concentrations of UFP and other traffic-related particles are influenced by opening windows, recirculating cabin air, and/or the use of enhanced filtration [111][112][113][114][115]. These findings have been reinforced by recent studies, some of which documented considerable variation in particle concentrations under different ventilation conditions [115][116][117]. For example, Kumar and colleagues [117] drove pre-planned routes in 10 cities and measured in-vehicle PM 2.5 concentrations with windows open and fan off (windows open), windows closed with fan on (fan on), and windows closed with recirculation mode on (recirculation). Relative to recirculation mode, PM 2.5 concentrations were up to 385% higher with fan on and up to 1020% higher with windows open.

(p6.1) In contrast, the evidence that vehicle ventilation or filtration influence health is much more limited. Prior to 2017, we are aware of one study that directly addressed this issue. In that non-randomized study, the use of a vehicle's air conditioning system improved air quality and modified the effects of PM 2.5 on HRV [118]. More recently, in a non-randomized study, Yu and colleagues [119,120] found that using high-efficiency cabin air filters in taxis with windows closed reduced mean PM 2.5 and ultrafine concentrations by 37% and 47%, respectively, but did not alter oxidative stress indicators.

(p6.2) That study and several others published recently also emphasized the trade-offs between closing windows and recirculating cabin air to reduce particle concentrations and avoiding high levels of CO 2 , which can cause drowsiness and cognitive impairment [115,[120][121][122][123][124][125]. Hudda and Fruin [125] conducted a modeling study to identify vehicle and trip characteristics associated with elevated CO 2 concentrations in passenger vehicles. They concluded that most one-or twooccupant trips of average duration would not exceed 2500 ppm (ppm) of CO 2, a threshold that has consistently been found to impair mental performance. However, for multiple passenger or long-distance trips, the authors suggested that recirculation mode should be periodically interrupted to avoid having CO 2 concentrations exceed 2500 ppm.
