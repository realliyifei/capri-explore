## (s0) Introduction
(p0.0) Not too long after the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick [1], physicists realized that neutrons could be a very useful tool to study condensed matter because the wavelength of slow neutrons is on the order of interatomic distances and the energy is comparable to many excitations in condensed matter.Therefore, neutron scattering can provide abundant information on the chemical structure and the dynamics of atoms.The neutron has no charge so it can penetrate deep into matter and directly interact with nuclei, whereas X-rays mainly interact with orbital electrons in atoms.Following the world's first nuclear reactor Chicago Pile-1 reaching criticality in 1942 led by Enrico Fermi, the nuclear age started.A year later in 1943, the Graphite Reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) went critical.Physicist Ernest Wollan and Cliff Shull quickly realized the great potential of the neutrons produced by the Graphite Reactor and embarked on a series of neutron diffraction experiments including the diffraction experiments showing the direct evidence of antiferromagnetism in MnO below its Curie temperature [2] and confirming the ferrimagnetic model for Fe 3 O 4 [3].These pioneering works opened the gate to a new era in neutron scattering.Between the 1950s and 1970s, a great number of research reactors were built and put into use across the world, some of which are still running nowadays.Table 1 lists the major neutron research reactors built between this time frame.Nuclear reactors provided a reliable way of getting high-flux neutrons, which greatly advanced the development of neutron scattering both in technique and instrumentation beyond diffraction.Bertram Brockhouse developed neutron spectroscopy to study the dynamics of a material by building the first triple-axis spectrometer in the world at the Chalk River Research Reactor in Canada.Both Shull and Brockhouse were awarded the Noble Physics Prize in 1994 for their significant contributions in neutron scattering.The construction of research reactors has slowed down or even stopped in most part of the world since 1980.Meanwhile, accelerator-based spallation neutron sources have gained popularity among the neutron community.All major spallation neutron sources since the 1980s are listed in Table 2. Unlike reactor sources, which produce a continuous and constant neutron flux, the spallation neutron sources usually send out neutrons in pulses with typical frequencies between 10 and 60 Hz.The time-averaged flux in today's pulsed neutron sources is still lower than that of a high-flux reactor source, but the peak flux is often much higher.For example, the neutron brightness at 1 Å of the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at ORNL is about 200 times higher than the time-averaged brightness of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), but the SNS's peak brightness at the same wavelength is about 10 times that of HFIR.By taking advantage of the time-of-flight (TOF) technique and optimized instrumentation, a pulsed neutron beamline can provide higher wavelength resolution, access broader (Q, ω) space, and generally have lower background.Over the last 70 years or so, neutron scattering has made huge progress in every aspect including the source, instrumentation, techniques, and applications.Today, neutron scattering has become an indispensable tool in many disciplines of science and technology including physics, biology, chemistry, materials science, engineering, and many interdisciplinary fields.

(p0.1) Compared to X-rays, a unique feature of the neutron is that it has a magnetic moment, which allows the neutron to interact with other magnetic moments and thus serve as an ideal probe of magnetic properties in magnetic materials.The fact that neutrons can be polarized further enhances the capability of neutron scattering in studying magnetism.The first polarized neutron experiment was performed in 1959 by Nathans et al. to study  magnetic scattering by iron and nickel in which the incident neutron beam was polarized [4].The method is now often referred to as the "half-polarized" or "flipping ratio" method, which greatly increases the sensitivity of probing small magnetic scattering amplitudes.In 1969, Moon et al. pioneered the polarization analysis method by adding a neutron polarization analyzer after the sample [5].This method is now called longitudinal polarization analysis (LPA) because the scattered beam polarization is only measured along the same direction as the incident polarization.LPA provides a convenient way to separate nuclear, magnetic, and spin-incoherent scattering components, which are otherwise hard to decouple.With the advances in neutron optics over the last 50 years, LPA has become the most widely used polarized neutron technique in the world.In the 1970s, Mezei developed the neutron spin echo (NSE) technique based upon Larmor precession of the neutron spin in magnetic fields [6].NSE encodes the neutron energy transfer in the Larmor precession angle of the neutron polarization to achieve the highest energy resolution in neutron spectroscopy and thus is ideal to study systems with slow dynamics.In the 1980s and 1990s, the polarization analysis method was extended to three-dimensional polarimetry by Tasset [7,8], now known as spherical neutron polarimetry (SNP).Compared to LPA, SNP exploits the vectorial nature of the neutron polarization and measures the full polarization change in the scattering process, which has found use in determining complex magnetic structures that are otherwise hard to determine unambiguously using other methods [9][10][11][12].There are also many other notable development of polarized neutron techniques including but not limited to XYZ polarization analysis [13], neutron resonance spin echo [14][15][16],
## (s2) Australia
(p2.0) Australia has a rich history in the field of neutron scattering.A major milestone in the history was the construction of the 10-MW High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) in 1958, which began to be utilized for neutron scattering research in the late 1960s until it was finally shut down in 2007 [25].In response to the need for a new, state-of-the-art neutron scattering facility, the Australian government initiated the construction of the Open-Pool Australian Lightwater (OPAL) research reactor at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), which became operational in 2007.The OPAL reactor is a modern, 20-MW multipurpose research reactor that provides a reliable and powerful neutron source for a diverse array of neutron scattering instruments.Currently, a total of 15 neutron instruments are available to users, six of which can perform polarized neutron experiments.
## (s4) India
(p4.0) India constructed Asia's first research reactor, Apsara, in 1956 at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Mumbai.Following Apsara's successful operation, Indian researchers began to explore the potential of neutron scattering in various fields of study.The commissioning of the second, more powerful research reactor, Cirus, in 1962 further accelerated the growth of neutron scattering research in India.The demand for higher neutron flux and better instruments propelled India to build Dhruva, a 100-MW reactor that went critical in 1985 and was designated as the National Facility for Neutron Beam Research (NFNBR) https:// www.barc.gov.in/ react or# nav-4.Currently, Dhruva is home to 12 neutron instruments, two of which have polarized neutron capabilities [87].
