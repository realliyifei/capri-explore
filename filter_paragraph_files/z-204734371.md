## (s5) The annulus theorem
(p5.0) The annulus theorem is a fundamental result in the development of the theory of manifolds. In high dimensions, it underpins the product structure theorem [KS77, Essay I, Theorem 5.1], which itself underpins all the results of [KS77]. We state the product structure theorem in Section 5.4. In dimension four, the annulus theorem is needed for the proofs of smoothing theorems (Section 8), existence and uniqueness of normal bundles (Section 6), and transversality (Section 10). We discuss these developments in later sections. Later in this section (Section 5.2), we will discuss a more immediate application: showing that connected sum is a well-defined operation on connected topological manifolds. Here is the annulus theorem.
