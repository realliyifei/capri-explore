## (s1) CONCLUSIONS
(p1.0) In this review paper I tried to put the biogeographic regions of India along with their floral biodiversity and some medicinal plants together. Biodiversity includes both flora and fauna which actually maintain the beauty of the Earth.

(p1.1) That's why the conservation is very important as the overexploitation and pollution is degrading the natural habitat of many species day by day, which ultimately caused the extinction of many species and many of them are at the risk of extinction. We need to protect the Earth to protect them. Due to various conditions and diverse range of floras India is blessed to be a Megadiversity country of the World.

(p1.2) About 70% of the medicinal plants are present in the tropical rainforest of the Eastern and Western Ghats, Himalayas, Aravallis, Chota Nagpur plateau, Sunderbans etc. Kashmir is one of the hotspot regions of the Himalayas but is not completely explored (25). We should explore more without disturbing them so that many new species could come to knowledge. Many medicinal plants are hidden in our deep forests which could be used for the benefits of the society.
