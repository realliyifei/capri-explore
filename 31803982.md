Additional file 7: Matrix of references to studies included in reviews included in the Overview


 [27,28]
; on smoking cessation [33,34] appear to have been updated but, at the time of the search for this overview, were reported as conference abstracts only. Additional studies were included in these reviews (taking the total number of studies to N=6 and N=9 respectively) but no information was reported in the abstract to enable the studies to be identified. Hence the matrix shows only the original number of studies and these reviews were not included when calculating the mean number of references to included studies per review. ** Number based on references in text; unable to confirm this covers all references for included studies. [18,19; 20] *** Includes all references to included studies, irrespective of quality (only moderate and strong quality studies were included in the synthesis; weak studies were excluded) [32] † This reference reports evaluations for multiple programs, hence has more than one entry in this table.
