## LITERATURE REVIEW Brand image

According to (McKnight et al., 2002), trust is built between parties who do not know each other either in the interaction or in the transaction process. Meanwhile, according to Gunawan (Gunawan & Imam, 2013) trust is defined as a form of attitude that shows feelings of like and persist in using a product or brand. (McKnight et al., 2002) state that there are two dimensions of consumer trust, namely: 1) Trusting Belief. State that there are three elements that build trusting belief, namely benevolence, integrity, competence. 2) Trusting Intention. A deliberate thing where a person is ready to depend on others in a situation, this happens personally and leads directly to other people.

Brand Image have been examined extensively by previous researchers including: , , (Ali & Mappesona, 2016), (Ali, Narulita, et al., 2018a), (Novansa & Ali, 1926), and (Toto Handiman & Ali, 2019). 


## Buying decision

In more detail, according (Tjiptono & Fandy, 2008) purchasing decisions are a process where consumers recognize the problem, seek information about a particular product or brand and evaluate how well each of these alternatives can solve the problem, which then leads to a purchase decision. Kotler and Keller (Kotler, Keller, et al., 2012) also describes the stages of the customer decision process Five Stage (Five stage model of the customer buying process),

The dimensions of purchasing decision variables used in this study based on  are: 1) Product selection. Can make decisions to buy a product or use the money for other purposes.

In this case the company must focus its attention on people who are interested in buying a product and the alternatives they are considering. 2) Purchase amount. Can make several decisions about how many products to buy and of course according to the needs and desires of consumers. 3) Time of purchase. Consumers make decisions about when to make purchases, this problem concerns their needs, for example: someone buys every day, once a week, even repeatedly.

Buying Decision have been examined extensively by previous researchers including: (Richardo et al., 2020), , (Yunita & Ali, 2017), (Brata et al., 2017), (Ali, 2019a), (Mappesona et al., 2020), (Ali, 2019a), (Novansa, Hafizh, Ali, 2017), (Sivaram et al., 2020), (Thanh Nguyen et al., 2019), (Ali, Evi, et al., 2018), (Ali, 2019b), (Anggita & Ali, 2017), (Toto Handiman & Ali, 2019), and (Ali, Narulita, et al., 2018b).


## Price perception

In theory, according to (Tjiptono & Fandy, 2008), the price is a monetary unit or other measure (including goods and services) that is exchanged in order to obtain ownership rights or use of a good or service. stated by Buchari Alma (Alma & Buchari, 2012), whereas according to the expert opinion, Djaslim Saladin (Buchory et al., 2010) suggests that price is a component that generates income while others generate costs.

Price dimension based on According to Kotler and Armstrong translated by Bob Sabran  explains that there are four measures that characterize price, namely price affordability, price compatibility with product quality, price compatibility with benefits, and price according to ability or price competitiveness can be explained as follows:

1) Price Affordability. can reach the price set by the company. 2) Price match with product quality. As an indicator of quality for consumers, people often choose a higher price between two goods because they see a difference in quality. 3) Price match with benefits. Buy a product if the benefits that are felt are greater or equal to what has been spent to get it.

Volume 1, Issue 2, August 2020 E-ISSN : 2721-3013, P-ISSN : 2721-3005 4) Prices are according to ability or price competitiveness. Often comparing the price of a product with other products, in this case the expensive price of a product is highly considered by consumers when buying the product. Price Perception have been examined extensively by previous researchers including: (Christina Catur Widayati et al., 2020), and (C.C.  


## Product Quality

Kotler and Keller in the research product quality is the ability of a product to deliver performance results that match or even exceed what customers expect. There are nine dimensions of product quality according to Kotler and Keller are as follows: form, feature, performance quality, durability, realibility style, design.

In line with the theory, product quality is a product characteristic in the ability to meet the needs that have been determined and latent. This product is defined as anything that can be offered to the market to gain attention, expertise, usefulness, or consumption that meets the wants or needs.

According to Philip Kotler explains one of the main values that customers expect from suppliers is the high quality of products and services. So from the statement can be stated that the quality of the product can affect consumers in deciding to obtain the product.

which reflects the quality of all dimensions of product offerings that generate benefits for customers. There are eight dimensions of product quality that are considered as attributes of an item evaluated by consumers and will be used in this research, namely: product performance, product features, reliabilities, conformance, durability, service ability, aesthetics, fit and finish.

Product quality variables have been examined extensively by previous researchers including: (Desfiandi, Fionita, et al., 2017), , (Ali, Narulita, et al., 2018a), , (Ali, Evi, et al., 2018), (Prihartono & Ali, 2020), (Riyanto et al., 2017), (Maisah & Ali, 2020), (Brata et al., 2017) 


## RESEARCH METHODS

The method of writing scientific articles is by qualitative methods and literature study or Library Research. Reviewing literature books in accordance with the theory discussed, especially in the scope of Human Resource Management (HRM). Besides, it is reputable scientific articles as well as scientific articles from journals that are not yet reputable. All cited scientific articles are sourced from Mendeley and Google Scholar. In qualitative research, literature review should be used consistently with methodological assumptions. This means that it must be used inductively so that it does not lead to the questions posed by the researcher. One of the main reasons for conducting qualitative research is that it is explorative in nature (Ali & Limakrisna, 2013).

Furthermore, it is discussed in depth in the section entitled "Related Literature" or literature review ("Review of Literature"), as a basis for the formulation of hypotheses and will then become the basis for making comparisons with the results or findings revealed in the research. (Ali & Limakrisna, 2013).


## FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

Based on the problem formulation and literature review, the discussion of this article is as follows:


## The effect of price perception on brand image

Price perception has a relationship and affects brand image. The better price perception by customers, the better the brand image of the product or company.

A brand image is a set of associations about a brand that is stored in the mind or memory of consumers ". There are several factors that influence brand image Schiffman and Kanuk (2007) mention the factors forming a brand image, namely: 1). Quality or quality, relating to the quality of the goods offered by producers with certain brands; 2) Trustworthy or dependable. relating to the opinion or agreement formed by the community about a product that is consumed; 3). Uses or benefits associated with the function of a product that can be used by consumers. 4). Price, which in this case relates to the high and low or the amount of money spent by consumers to influence a product, can also affect the long-term image; and 5). The image that is owned by the brand itself, namely in the form of views, agreements and information relating to a brand of a particular product. This is in line with the results of research conducted previously by , (M & Ali, 2017), (Ali & Mappesona, 2016), (Ali, Narulita, et al., 2018a), (Novansa & Ali, 1926), and (Toto Handiman & Ali, 2019).


## The effect product quality on brand image

Product quality has a positive and significant effect on brand image. In retail, product quality is divided into, product packaging, after-sales, and product availability / variety. The Product Quality dimension itself consists of: performance, durability, conformance to specifications, features (features), reliability, aesthetics, perceived quality. Brand image is the key to retaining customers (Oliver, 2010), where the dimensions of the brand image are: access to services, service offered, personal contact, security and reputation. The results of this study are in line with research by Flavian, Torres, and Guinaliu (2004), that there is a significant relationship between Service Quality and Brand Image.

This is in line with the results of research conducted previously by (Desfiandi, Fionita, et al., 2017), , (Ali, Narulita, et al., 2018a), , (Ali, Evi, et al., 2018), (Prihartono & Ali, 2020), (Riyanto et al., 2017), (Maisah & Ali, 2020), (Brata et al., 2017), (Thanh Nguyen et al., 2019), (Agussalim et al., 2017, (Ali, 2019b), and (Anggita & Ali, 2017). (Christina Catur Widayati et al., 2020), and (C.C. , Agussalim, 2017).


## The effect of price perception on purchasing decisions

Price perception has an effect on purchasing decisions. The better price perception by customers, the better will be the interest in purchasing decisions.

Price is an element of the marketing mix that is flexible, which can change at any time according to time and place. Prices are not just numbers on the label of a package or store shelf, but prices have many forms and carry out many functions. According to Kotler and Keller (2012: 67), price is one element of the marketing mix that generates revenue, another element generates costs. Price is the easiest element in any marketing program to customize, product features, channels, and even communication take a lot of time.

Campbell in Cockril and Goode (2010: 368) states that price perception is a psychological factor from various aspects that has an important influence on consumer reactions to prices. That's why price perception is the reason why someone makes a decision to buy. This is in line with the results of research conducted previously by (Christina Catur Widayati et al., 2020), (C.C. , : (Richardo et al., 2020), , (Yunita & Ali, 2017), (Brata et al., 2017), (Ali, 2019a), (Mappesona et al., 2020), (Ali, 2019a).


## The effect of product quality on purchasing decisions

Product quality affects the purifying decision. Product quality is the physical condition, function and characteristics of a product, both goods or services based on the level of quality expected, such as durability, reliability, accuracy, ease of operation, product repair and other product attributes with the aim of meeting and satisfying the needs of consumers or customers.

Product quality is one of the keys to competition among business actors that are offered to consumers. Consumers always want to get quality products according to the price paid, even though there are some people who think that, expensive products are quality products. If this can be done by the company, then the company will still be able to satisfy consumers and be able to increase the number of consumers. That this research is supported by previous research by (Richardo et al., 2020), , (Yunita & Ali, 2017), (Brata et al., 2017), (Ali, 2019a), (Mappesona et al., 2020), (Ali, 2019a), (Novansa, Hafizh, Ali, 2017), (Sivaram et al., 2020), (Thanh Nguyen et al., 2019), (Ali, Evi, et al., 2018), (Ali, 2019b), (Anggita & Ali, 2017), (Toto Handiman & Ali, 2019), (Ali, Narulita, et al., 2018b).


## The effect brand image on purchasing decisions.

Brand image has a relationship and affects purchasing decisions. The better the brand image is perceived by customers, the better the interest in purchasing decisions will be.

The buying decision is one of the main components of consumer behavior. Consumer purchasing decisions are the step-by-step consumers use when buying goods and services. The purchase decision is a problem-solving approach to human activities to buy goods or services in fulfilling their wants and needs which consists of identifying needs and wants, searching for information, evaluating alternative purchases, purchasing decisions and behavior after purchase (Swastha, 2007). This is in line with the results of research conducted previously by: (Ikhsani & Ali, 2017), (Ali, Narulita, et al., 2018b), (Brata et al., 2017), (Ikhsani & Ali, 2017), (Ali, 2019b), (Yunita & Ali, 2017), (Mappesona et al., 2020), (Novansa, Hafizh, Ali, 2017), (Sivaram et al., 2020), (Richardo et al., 2020).
