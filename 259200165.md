Background:Williams syndrome is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by a 1.5-1.8 Mb deletion on chromosome 7q11.23. It is characterized by facial deformations, cardiovascular abnormalities, developmental delays, gastrointestinal manifestations, and endocrine disorders.Case description: A 1-year-old child presenting with developmental delays, special facial features, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal calcium deposition, and hypotonia was admitted to the hospital for "hypercalcemia and gastrointestinal bleeding." Genetic testing showed a deletion mutation in the 7q11.23 region. Currently, the child receiving treatment to promote calcium excretion and rehabilitation training, but hypercalcemia has recurred.

## Admission examination

The following data were recorded at admission: Body weight: 6.8 kg (less than the third percentile); body length: 70 cm (less than the third percentile); head circumference: 42 cm (less than the third percentile); poor spirits; and a special appearance, including a round forehead, short eye fissures, epicanthus, a full periorbital area, swollen double eyelids, a low and flat nose, full cheeks, thick lips, a medium face length, a large mouth, and small teeth with a sparse arrangement ( Figure 1). A grade 2/6 systolic murmur could be heard at the left ster-F I G U R E 1 A picture of the patient.

nal margin 2-3 intercostal space. Neurological examination revealed normal muscle strength, reduced muscle tone, and no other special features. 


## Auxiliary examination


## Treatment and follow-up

After admission, intravenous fluid replacement and fuemiliuresis were given to promote calcium excretion, temporary water fasting was performed for gastrointestinal bleeding, omeprazole was given for acid inhibition, and symptomatic treatment was given for hemostasis. The patient had a total calcium level of 2.73 mmol/L; a magnesium level of 0.93 mmol/L; a phosphorus level of 1.38 mmol/L; a sodium level of 137 mmol/L; and a potassium level of 5.18 mmol/L. Later, the patient was treated with oral furosemide and potassium citrate. During followup after discharge, the child was treated with oral furosemide tablets (5 mg qd) and potassium citrate granules (0.5 g tid) and vitamin D and calcium intake is avoided. During follow-up, the child had a recurrence of hypercalcemia, which was improved after receiving corresponding treatment again and has not recurred.


# DISCUSSION

Most cases of WS are sporadic, with little family history. The incidence of WS is 1 in 20,000 live births, and the latest reports show that the incidence can be as high as 1 in 7500 (Brawn & Porter, 2014 training can be provided to improve the quality of life of these patients.

Auxiliary tests showed the following (reference values in parentheses): Urinary color ultrasound showed renal calcium deposition and CT showed multiple patchy slight high-density shadows in both kidneys. Routine blood examination, liver and kidney function tests, myocardial enzymes, peripheral blood smear, blood gas analysis, thy-tion size of 1.78 Mb. The above variation was not found in the child's parents, so it was considered a novel variation. The diagnosis of WS was confirmed according to the clinical diagnosis score table(Harel et al., 2000) of WS, developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the genetic testing results.a serum total calcium level of 3.98 mmol/L (2.1-2.8 mmol/L); a mag-

nesium level of 0.94 mmol/L (0.75-1.02 mmol/L); a phosphorus level 

of 1.00 mmol/L (1.48-2.20 mmol/L); a sodium level of 136.4 mmol/L 

(134-143 mmol/L); a potassium level of 3.95 mmol/L (4.2-5.9 mmol/L); 

a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 0.39 pmol/L (1.6-6.9 pmol/L); 

a 25•hydroxyvitamin D level > 70 ng/mL (experts recommend a level 

of at least 30 ng/mL); a urinary calcium/creatinine ratio of 1.35 

(normal < 0.2); and a 24-h urinary calcium level of 7.0 mg/kg (nor-

mal < 4 mg/kg). Color echocardiography showed patent foramen ovale 

(0.24 cm). roid function, urine organic acid analysis, blood amino acid analysis, and 

carnitine analysis showed no abnormalities. 

After examining and the patient's family members by using Agi-

lent SurePrintG3HumanGenomeCGHMicroarray (array CGH) 8 × 60 

K chip (Agilent Technologies, America), the instructions for com-

parative genomic hybridization were followed. Luciferin (Cy3/Cy5) 

was applied to label the DNA of the patient and reference sam-

ples, and then microarray hybridization and posthybridization washing 

were performed. Fluorescence images were obtained by an Agilent 

chip scanner, the data were read by Feature Extraction Technolo-

gies, and standardized processing was performed. Data analysis was 

performed using Genomic Workbench (Agilent Technologies), and 

regions of copy number change were found. The position in the 

genome was determined according to the Human Genome Refer-

ence Sequence (GRCH37/HG19), which became available in the UCSC 

database in February 2009. Gene-related clinical information via

online human Mendelian inheritance (OMIM: 194050) was used to 

analyze the data. The test results showed (Figure 2) arr 7q11.23 

(72,436,289−74,213,788) × 1, 72,436,289−74,213,788, with a varia-




). The main clinical manifestations of WS are as follows: special features (full periorbital area, low nose bridge, long, small jaw, sparsely arranged teeth, etc.), cardiovascular disease (aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, etc.), abnormal renal function and structure, developmental delays, abnormal personality (overly friendly, anxious, irritable, concentration difficulties, etc.), and gastrointestinal tract anomalies (such as constipation and diverticulitis). WS can also cause ocular diseases, among which strabismus may be the most common manifestation. Hypercalulitis is 9 years old(Ignacio et al., 2012). In our case, gastrointestinal bleeding occurred at the age of 1 year, and the risk of diverticulitis should be monitored. In future follow-up, we need to pay attention to this symptom, make a timely diagnosis and provide corresponding treatment.At present, there are still few reports of WS with hypercalcemia, and no cases of gastrointestinal bleeding were found in infants and young children (1 year of age) with WS. WS can present with different degrees of multisystem clinical manifestations. This study describes one patient with WS with manifestations of "hypercalcemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, developmental delays, etc., " which provides a reference for clinicians to identify this disease. When clinicians encounter children with hypercalcemia, special facial features, developmental delays, gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, and heart diseases, WS should be considered. Genetic testing techniques such as FISH and MLPA can be used to confirm the diagnosis, and early intervention and rehabilitationcemia may occur in a small number of children. A total of 10 cases of 

WS in children with hypercalcemia with complete data reports were 

collected from the CNKI, Wanfang and PubMed databases from the 

establishment of the database to October 2022. A total of 11 patients 

were included in this study. There were no WS cases characterized by 

"gastrointestinal bleeding" at home or abroad, which is also worthy of 

attention. Eleven patients had stunted growth, 6 had cardiovascular 

disease, 6 had irritability, 6 had renal calcinosis, 5 had malnutrition, 

4 had low muscle tone, 4 had constipation, 2 had tones, and 2 had 

increased urination; we included only patients with digestive tract 

hemorrhage. 

The mechanism of hypercalcemia in WS is still unclear. This may 

be related to the increased absorption and/or decreased clearance of 

calcium. This increase in intestinal calcium absorption may be due to 

a higher serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level, which suggests vita-

min D intoxication and/or a disturbance in the subtle regulation of 

vitamin D metabolism in the kidney, both of which may contribute to 

increased calcium absorption. Other patients have normal vitamin D 

levels but increased sensitivity to vitamin D, which may be related 

to increased intestinal calcium absorption. Another study suggested 

that the elevated calcium levels were due to increased calcium release 

from bone (Lameris et al., 2014). The efficacy of pamidronate and 

other diphosphonates in reducing calcium levels supports the theory 

that hypercalcemia in WS patients may be caused by bone calcium 

release. However, this theory was contradicted by another study that 

found normal alkaline phosphatase levels in WS patients. Therefore, 
the mechanisms underlying the development of hypercalcemia are still 

unclear. 

Treatments for hypercalcemia in WS patients include correcting 

dehydration, increasing renal calcium excretion, and limiting intestinal 

calcium absorption or bone reabsorption. Treatment in the acute phase 

includes the discontinuation of vitamin D intake, the administration of 

a low-calcium diet, intravenous fluids and furosemide, and careful mon-

itoring of electrolytes to avoid hypokalemia. Adjunctive therapy in the 

acute phase includes calcitonin, glucocorticoids, and dialysis. Bilal et al. 

(2018) found that the infusion of phosphonic acid salt may have a good 

curative effect for WS patients with refractory hypercalcemia. There 

was a successful use of para metres phosphonic acid sodium treat-

ment in 6 patients. Three patients did not need a calcium diet for a 

long period of time, but the use of double phosphonic acid salt in the 

pediatric population still lacks food and drug administration approval. 

Hypercalcemia is a clinical emergency. Hypercalcemia crisis occurs 

when the blood calcium level is higher than 3.5 mmol/L, which can 

endanger the life of children in severe cases. Patients with hypercal-

cemia often have no specific clinical manifestations but may present 

with fatigue, poor appetite, nausea, bone pain, headache, disturbance 

of consciousness and other manifestations. Urgent calcemia is needed 

to maintain the stability of the body's internal environment, so it is 

crucial for the treatment of WS with hypercalcemia. Among these 11 

patients, 2 were treated with furosemide and calcium intake restric-

tion, of which 1 had recurrence during follow-up, and 1 had a good 

treatment effect. One patient was treated with furosemide and pred-

nisone and another was treated with prednisone and pamidronate, 

and the effects were good. Furosemide and pamidronate were given 

for 7 patients; only 1 patient had recurrence, and the rest had good 

treatment effects. Long-term treatment was recommended according 

to the 2001 WS Health Supervision guidelines (Committee on Genet-

ics, 2001), which recommends a low-calcium diet without vitamin D 

supplementation and the use of sunscreen to prevent further vitamin 

D absorption. Long-term monitoring includes regular monitoring of 

serum calcium levels at diagnosis, 2 years of age, and 5 years of age, 

followed by annual monitoring during adolescence and adulthood. 

In addition, patients with WS are at greater risk for diverticulitis. WS 

is caused by the loss of elastin on chromosome 7, one of the main roles 

of which is to maintain the strength and elasticity of the intestinal wall, 

and the loss of this protein gene may be the main cause of diverticulitis. 

A study by the Committee of the German Williams Syndrome Associa-

tion found that among 128 WS patients aged 18-62.2 years, 14 were 

diagnosed with sigmoid diverticulitis (Partsch et al., 2005). Another 

study reported that a 35-year-old WS patient developed acute diver-

ticulitis accompanied by severe peritonitis (Bowling Sean & Matthew 

et al., 2022). Studies have shown that diverticulitis is present in up to 

one-third of WS patients, and the youngest reported age for divertic-
