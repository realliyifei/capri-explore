The Data Analysis Pipeline for the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU Galaxy Survey: Emission-Line Modeling
(Received; Revised; Accepted) Submitted to AJD J 14, 2019 Typeset using L A T E X twocolumn style in AASTeX62methods: data analysis -surveys -techniques: imaging spectroscopy
SDSS-IV MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) is the largest integral-field spectroscopy survey to date, aiming to observe a statistically representative sample of 10,000 low-redshift galaxies. In this paper we study the reliability of the emission-line fluxes and kinematic properties derived by the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP). We describe the algorithmic choices made in the DAP with regards to measuring emission-line properties, and the effect of our adopted strategy of simultaneously fitting the continuum and line emission. The effect of random errors are quantified by studying various fit-quality metrics, idealized recovery simulations and repeat observations. This analysis demonstrates that the emission lines are well-fit in the vast majority of the MaNGA dataset and the derived fluxes and errors are statistically robust. The systematic uncertainty on emission-line properties introduced by the choice of continuum templates is also discussed. In particular, we test the effect of using different stellar libraries and simple stellar-population models on the derived emission-line fluxes and the effect of introducing different tying prescriptions for the emission-line kinematics. We show that these effects can generate large (> 0.2 dex) discrepancies at low signal-to-noise and for lines with low equivalent width (EW); however, the combined effect is noticeable even for Hα EW > 6 Å. We provide suggestions for optimal use of the data provided by SDSS data release 15 and propose refinements on the DAP for future MaNGA data releases.

## INTRODUCTION

Advances in our understanding of galaxy evolution are fundamentally linked to the development of increasingly sophisticated models to derive physical properties from observables. Integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) surveys of nearby galaxies, combining large-number statistics with the information content of resolved spectroscopy, represent some of the richest * ESO fellow, francesco.belfiore@eso.org datasets currently available to the astronomical community and pose their own specific data-modeling challenges. Modern IFS surveys of nearby galaxies -including ATLAS 3D (Cappellari et al. 2011), CALIFA (Sánchez et al. 2012), SAMI (Croom et al. 2012) and MaNGA (Bundy et al. 2015) -are designed around a wide variety of science goals, which often rely on the simultaneous determination of the stellar and gas kinematics, emission-line ratios and stellar-population properties (like age and metallicity) via specialized tools.


## B .

To provide users with readily available model-independent high-level data products, the SDSS-IV (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) MaNGA survey has developed a data analysis pipeline (DAP), to process the reduced MaNGA datacubes in an automated and uniform way, which has now been released publicly for the first time. In addition to fully reduced data products, the fifteenth SDSS Data Release (DR15, Aguado et al. 2018) includes the output of the MaNGA DAP for an unprecedented sample of 4688 spatially-resolved galaxies.

A detailed description of the DAP design workflow, and output is presented in Westfall et al. (2019). In brief, the MaNGA DAP has been designed as both an automated pipeline and a general-purpose tool, and it is largely focused on modelindependent measurements. For DR15 the DAP provides stellar kinematics, emission-line properties, and assessments of stellar-continuum features as measured by spectral indices, such as the Lick indices and D4000. Although the DAP fits the stellar continuum with the aim of deriving accurate emissionline fluxes, the codes does not provide stellar-population properties (age, metallicity, etc.). For stellar-population products, we point users to two value-added catalogs (VACs) that have analyzed the MaNGA data using the FIREFLY (Wilkinson et al. 2015(Wilkinson et al. , 2017 and Pipe3D (Sánchez et al. 2016) codes. The FIREFLY value-added catalogue (VAC) relies on the DAP for binning and subtraction of nebular line emission. Pipe3D, on the other hand, performs independent continuum subtraction and emission-line measurements and provides a comparison point for the DAP functionality. A brief overview of the data products released by these two pipelines is provided by Aguado et al. (2018). Westfall et al. (2019) also present a detailed assessment of the stellar kinematics provided by the DAP. Here we provide a complementary analysis of the emission-line properties, focusing on fluxes and kinematics. We validate the measurements as well as the statistical fidelity of the DAP-produced uncertainties. Our approach follows both the classical perspective of adding noise to mock data as well as making use of repeat observations specifically obtained for testing the repeatability of the MaNGA survey output.

Importantly, we also recognize that the derivation of emission-line fluxes and kinematics suffer from a certain amount of model-dependent systematics. In this work, therefore, we explore several sources of systematic error -e.g. the use of different stellar-continuum templates, how one ties the kinematic parameters of different emission lines, and the simultaneous or sequential optimization of fits of the emission lines and underlying continuum. Although these issues are not new to the literature, we discuss them here in a coherent framework, which we hope will constitute a useful reference for the spectral-fitting community beyond the users of the MaNGA data itself.

A key aspect of accurately measuring the nebular emission lines is properly accounting for the stellar continuum. This is particularly important for the Balmer lines, where underlying stellar absorption can reduce the Hβ emission-line equivalent width by up to 10 Å at low spectral resolution (Groves et al. 2012). In early work focused on H II regions, it was common to assume a constant 2 Å correction (McCall et al. 1985). The development of more sophisticated stellar-population models enabled a more rigorous approach whereby the stellar continuum is fit using a linear combination of simple stellarpopulation models (SSPs) with reddening treated as an additional free parameter. This approach was first applied on a large scale to the SDSS data by the MPA-JHU group in their analysis of the SDSS-I spectra (Tremonti et al. 2004;Brinchmann et al. 2004;Aihara et al. 2011). They carried out the fitting in two stages: first, they masked the emission lines and modeled the stellar continuum using a linear combination of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) SSP models modified by a Charlot & Fall (2000) dust law with the velocity dispersion and redshift constrained a priori. Next, the stellar continuum was subtracted, low-order residuals were removed using a sliding median, and the emission lines were simultaneously fit with Gaussian functions.

A downside of treating the stellar-population modeling and emission-line fitting as separate steps is that valuable regions of the spectrum are masked during the continuum fit and uncertainties in the continuum fit are not propagated forward into the emission-line fits. To circumvent these issues and accurately measure very weak lines in early-type galaxies, Sarzi et al. (2006) introduced a routine called GANDALF (gas and absorption-line fitting algorithm), based on an early version of pPXF , that simultaneously fits the stellar continuum and nebular emission lines, given a previously determined stellar kinematics solution for the continuum. This code was subsequently applied to the SDSS data by Oh et al. (2011).

IFS data poses a particular challenge to analyze because the outer regions of galaxies often have low signal-to-noise (S/N) in the continuum (i.e., S/N per pixel of 3-5). This makes it difficult to accurately constrain the stellar continuum, especially when stellar kinematics are determined simultaneously with stellar-population ages and metallicities. The penalized pixel-fitting (pPXF) software Cappellari 2017), developed for use on the SAURON data , pioneered a robust pixel-fitting method, particularly optimized for determining template mixes and robust kinematics from data with moderate S/N (∼ 10 − 20) and resolution. This technique can be coupled with adaptive Voronoi binning (Cappellari & Copin 2003) to achieve the S/N needed to accurately fit the stellar continuum in IFS data.

The CALIFA survey has led the way in terms of the development of spectral-fitting pipelines suitable for a wide range of galaxy types (e.g. Cid Fernandes et al. 2013). The FIT3D pipeline (Sánchez 2006) and its newer implementation Pipe3D (Sánchez et al. 2019) have developed a detailed procedure for employing different binning schemes for the stellar and emission-line properties. For example, Pipe3D performs an initial spatial binning based on continuum signal-to-noise ratio and analyzes the binned spectra to determine the properties of the stellar continuum. It then re-scales the best-fit continuum model to match the flux in each individual spaxel in the bin, subtracts the re-scaled continuum, and fits the neb-ular lines. An emission-line-free spectrum is then created, and the process is iterated without the emission-line masks. The Pipe3D code has subsequently been run on MaNGA data (Sánchez et al. 2019) and the output is presented in the MaNGA Pipe3D VAC.1

Other emission-line fitting codes have been developed to optimize the information extracted from different data sets. For example, the SAMI IFS data has higher spectral resolution in its red-wavelength arm than either MaNGA or CALIFA, and, as a consequence, many of the emission lines show complex line profiles that are not well-fit by a single Gaussian profile (Hampton et al. 2017;Green et al. 2018). The LZIFU (Ho et al. 2016) code constrains the stellar continuum in individual spaxels using pPXF, and then it fits the emission lines with multiple Gaussians where needed.

In the MaNGA DAP, we employ a 'hybrid' binning scheme (Voronoi for the continuum and individual spaxels for the emission lines; see Section 2.2) and simultaneously fit the continuum and emission lines, which is made possible by the latest version (> 6.0 in python) of the pPXF software package (Cappellari 2017). 2 Finally, we warn the potential user that the DAP remains limited in how well-suited its output is to certain emissionline-related science goals. For example, studies of chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM) within galaxies (Sánchez et al. 2014;Belfiore et al. 2017; Barrera-Ballesteros et al. 2017;Poetrodjojo et al. 2018) rely on accurate derivation of emission-line fluxes and their ratios within H regions, and such studies benefit from the highest spatial resolution allowed by the data to avoid contamination from the diffuse ISM. The study of the ISM in early-type galaxies (Sarzi et al. 2010;Belfiore et al. 2016), on the other hand, requires careful modeling of the stellar continuum in order to recover the fluxes of faint low-equivalent-width lines and may benefit from ad-hoc spatial binning. Studies of the diffuse ionized ISM (Zhang et al. 2017) and extra-planar gas (Jones et al. 2017) also crucially rely on binning and stacking of lowsurface-brightness emission, while galactic outflows can be dissected by careful analysis of asymmetries in the emissionline profiles (Gallagher et al. 2018). We anticipate that several users will use the DAP output as a reference and starting point towards more complex and tailored analysis.

In this paper, we describe the algorithmic choices made in the DAP with regards to measuring emission-line properties (Section 2). The effects of random errors are quantified by studying various fit-quality metrics, idealized recovery simulations and repeat observations in Section 3. The systematic uncertainty in emission-line properties introduced by the choice of continuum templates is analyzed in Section 4. In particular, we test the effect of using different stellar libraries and simple-stellar-population models on the derived emission-line fluxes. In Section 5 we consider other sys-1

2 Available here https://pypi.org/project/ppxf/. tematics introduced by our algorithmic choices, such as the adopted strategy of simultaneously fitting the continuum with the emission lines. In Section 6 we summarize our recommendations for optimal use of the data provided by DR15 and some ideas for future DAP development data. A brief summary is given in Section 7. Throughout this paper, and in all data released by SDSS, wavelengths are given in vacuum.

2. THE MANGA DAP ALGORITHM 2.1. The input MaNGA data

The MaNGA survey is one of the three key components of SDSS-IV (Blanton et al. 2017), and aims to obtain IFS data for a representative sample of 10 000 galaxies in the redshift range 0.01 < z < 0.15 by 2020. The MaNGA instrument operates on the SDSS 2.5m telescope at Apache Point Observatory (Gunn et al. 2006) and consists of a set of 17 hexagonal fiber bundles of different sizes, plus a set of mini-bundles and sky fibers used for flux calibration and sky subtraction respectively (Drory et al. 2015;Law et al. 2015;Yan et al. 2016a,b). All fibers are fed into the dual-beam BOSS spectrographs covering the wavelength range from 3600 Å to 10300 Å with a spectral resolution R ∼ 2000 (Smee et al. 2013).

MaNGA galaxies are selected from an extended version of the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) and are observed out to 1.5 R e (primary sample, comprising 2/3 of the total sample) or 2.5 R e (secondary sample, comprising 1/3 of the total sample). Targets are selected to be representative of the overall galaxy population at each stellar mass in the range 9.0 < log(M /M ) < 11.0. In practice the absolute i-band magnitude is used for sample selection to avoid the systematic uncertainty intrinsic in deriving stellar masses (Wake et al. 2017).

The starting point of this paper are the datacubes produced for DR15, by the MaNGA data-reduction pipeline (DRP; Law et al. 2016), with additional modifications described in Aguado et al. (2018). The MaNGA DAP takes as input the reduced MaNGA datacubes generated with logarithmic wavelength sampling.

An overview of the DAP workflow is presented in Westfall et al. (2019). Here, we summarize the aspects of the algorithm that are most relevant to the derivation of emission-line properties, in order to motivate the tests performed in the rest of the paper. A graphical overview of the relevant components of the DAP workflow is presented in Figure 1 and discussed in the following sections.


### Overview of the MaNGA DAP with regards to emission lines

The DAP currently performs two full-spectrum fits, both using pPXF. The first fit primarily determines the stellar kinematics and the second models the emission lines. Two example spectra fitted by the MaNGA DAP can be inspected in Figure 2. For DR15, the stellar kinematics are determined only for spectra binned to g-band S/N>10, as produced by applying the Voronoi binning algorithm implemented in the B . Best fit emission lines model Figure 1. A graphical representation of the DAP workflow. The figure highlights the interplay between different binning schemes (red), fitting steps performed with pPXF (blue), non-parametric measurements (black) and output quantities (orange). The algorithm can be roughly divided into two sections: the first step is dedicated to the extraction of the stellar kinematics (left side of the figure), while the second one performs the simultaneous fitting of gas and stars (right side of the figure). The main outputs produced by the DAP are the MAPS and LOGCUBE files, containing respectively the 2D maps of derived parameters (e.g. velocities, fluxes, etc.) and the 3D best-fit models (in datacube format).


## Binning


## Fitting (pPXF)


## Non-parametric measurements

python language3 by Cappellari & Copin (2003). The subsequent emission-line modeling is done for both the binned spectra and after deconstructing the bins into the individuals spaxels; a full description of the emission-line-fitting module of the DAP is provided in Section 8 of Westfall et al. (2019).

As it is most relevant to emission-line science, we focus on the results provided by the latter approach, which we term the 'hybrid' binning scheme (see below).


#### The stellar-kinematics fit (first fitting stage)

When using pPXF to determine the stellar kinematics (Westfall et al. 2019, Section 7), spectral regions potentially affected by line emission are masked. The adopted masks extend ±750 km s −1 around the expected emission-line wavelength at the galaxy systemic redshift. In DR15, we use a set of templates determined using a hierarchical-clustering analysis of the MILES stellar library (Sanchez-Blazquez et al. 2006;Falcón-Barroso et al. 2011); see a detailed description of 3 Available here https://pypi.org/project/vorbin/ the MILES-HC library in Section 5 of Westfall et al. (2019), and summarized in Section 4.1 below. We also include an eighth-order additive Legendre polynomial, motivated by the experience from the SAURON ) and ATLAS 3D (Cappellari et al. 2011) teams, to improve the quality of the derived kinematics by providing a closer match between data and spectral templates. However, it is important to note that the additive polynomials modify the absorption-line depth of the stellar templates, which becomes important to our discussion in Section 5.2.


#### The hybrid binning approach

Since the line emission surface-brightness can be very different from the continuum surface-brightness, the relevant binning scale is not necessarily the same for continuum and emission-line science. Indeed, the emission-line fitting can be performed by optimally rebinning the data for the extraction of the emission-line properties (Cid Fernandes et al. 2013;Belfiore et al. 2016;Sánchez et al. 2016); however, this strategy has not yet been implemented within the DAP. Instead, we model the emission lines in each spaxel as follows:  we first remap the best-fitting stellar kinematics determined for the binned spectra to the individual spaxels and then, keeping the stellar kinematics fixed, we simultaneously optimize the stellar-continuum and emission-line templates to determine the best-fit model spectrum. We refer to this as the 'hybrid' binning approach because the stellar kinematics uses the Voronoi binned data, whereas the emission-line results are for individual spaxels. Importantly, during the emission-line modeling, the algorithm re-optimizes the continuum templates to fit each spaxel, rather than simply rescaling the best-fit stellar continuum from the Voronoi-binned fit to each spaxel (as done, for example, by Pipe3D). The output of this scheme (HYB10-GAU-MILESHC; see below) is the recommended data product in DR15 for users interested in emission-line properties of MaNGA galaxies.4 4 A fit to the emission lines on the same Voronoi bins as the stellar continuum is also provided for users whose science goals require, e.g., the stellar and gas kinematics to be computed over the exact same spatial scales.


#### Simultaneous fit of gas and stars (second fitting stage)

To simultaneously optimize the fit to the stellar continuum and the emission lines, we use pPXF with Gaussian emissionline templates associated to kinematic parameters that are independent of those used for the stellar templates (Cappellari 2017). Simultaneous fits of emission-line and continuum templates has been introduced and recommended in previous work (Sarzi et al. 2006;Oh et al. 2011) as a way of minimizing the bias resulting from masking of the wings of the Balmer absorption profiles and other stellar features on the recovered emission-line fluxes. This approach allows one to enforce the physical constraint that emission lines cannot be negative, while optimizing the fit to the stellar continuum. pPXF adopted the same idea for the gas fitting, but implemented this strategy in a different way as described in Cappellari (2017). An example of the results of this fitting algorithm can be seen in Figure 2 for both a highly star-forming and an early-type galaxy. We assess the difference in the best-fit models derived by simultaneous versus subsequent fitting of the emission lines in Section 5.1.  & Ferland 2006). For DR15 we tie the velocity of all the fitted emission lines, but do not tie the velocity dispersions with the exception of most of the doublets. Specifically, the line doublets with fixed flux ratios and the [O II]λλ3727,29 doublet have their velocity dispersions tied between the doublet lines, but each doublet and all other lines have independent velocity dispersions.5 While tying the kinematics of different emission lines may prove advantageous to recover the flux of weak lines, we do note tie all velocity dispersions in DR15 to allow for modest inaccuracies (generally a few percent; Law et al., in preparation) in the wavelength-dependent line-spread function (LSF) determined by the MaNGA DRP; further discussion of the current line-tying strategy is presented in Section 5.2. Given the limited spectral range of the adopted MILES-HC stellar library, lines redder than ∼7400 Å are not fit for DR15. In future data releases, however, we plan to use templates with a larger wavelength range to allow for a determination of the continuum under the emission lines redder than 7400 Å (see Section 4).

During the fitting procedure, the DAP does not constrain the emission-line fluxes to follow a specific attenuation law resulting from dust present in the host galaxy (as generally done in GANDALF, e.g., Oh et al. 2011, and optionally available in pPXF). All line fluxes are, however, corrected for Galactic foreground extinction using the maps of Schlegel et al. (1998) and the reddening law of O'Donnell (1994). Users comparing the DAP output with the output generated by other spectralfitting pipelines may need to take this factor into account.

An eighth-order multiplicative Legendre polynomial is used in DR15 to match the overall spectral shape of the data, which can deviate from that of the models both because of dust extinction and small inaccuracies in the spectrophotometric calibration. A physically motivated extinction law may be used in the MaNGA DAP instead of multiplicative polynomials, but this was found to produce worse fits to the stellar continuum, especially at the blue end of the spectrum (see Section 5.1). Additive polynomials are not, and indeed ought not to be, used in this stage as they modify the depth of stellar absorption lines in the templates, therefore potentially leading to degeneracies with emission-line strengths. This point is further elucidated in Section 5.1. Neither polynomials nor extinction corrections are applied to the emission-line templates by the fit, but only to the stellar continuum.


#### Non-parametric emission-line properties and EW

The DAP also calculates non-parametric emission-line moments (zeroth, first, and second), both before and after the emission-line modeling (see Figure 1). Both iterations subtract a best-fit stellar-continuum model before calculating the moments; additional detail is provided in Section 9 and Table  2 of Westfall et al. (2019). The first iteration subtracts the best-fit stellar continuum used to determine the stellar kinematics, and the first moments are used as initial guesses for the ionized-gas velocities in the emission-line modeling. The second iteration subtracts the best-fit stellar continuum determined during the emission-line modeling to account for the re-optimization of the continuum fit. The integrated fluxes (zeroth moments) from the second iteration are provided in the DAP output (SFLUX extensions in the output file), in addition to the values derived from the Gaussian fitting (GFLUX extensions). Equivalent widths (EW) for each line are obtained by dividing the flux in the line by local pseudo-continua. Both summed and Gaussian-fit fluxes are used, leading to two computations of the EW in the final output (SEW and GEW, respectively).


### Output files

A full description of the DAP output data model is provided by Westfall et al. (2019), particularly in Sections 2 and 11 and Appendix A.

Emission-line fluxes (from both Gaussian fitting and the moments analysis), velocities, velocity dispersion and associated errors and masks are consolidated into the main DAP output file, the MAPS file, for each analyzed datacube. The MAPS file is a multi-extension fits file, where each extension provides a set of 2D maps of DAP measurements.6

The best-fit continuum and emission-line models are given as extensions in the DAP model LOGCUBE file. Most extensions in this file are three-dimensional datacubes, presented on the same world coordinate frame as the input MaNGA datacube. The model LOGCUBE provides the results of both the continuum-only fit used to determine the stellar kinematics, and the combined fit used to simultaneously model the continuum and emission.7 We highlight here, however, that the continuum from the stellar-kinematics fit should not be used to recompute emission-line parameters.


### Known limitations

While the vast majority of spaxels are successfully fit by the MaNGA DAP, users should be aware of some known failure modes, discussed in Section 10.2.2 of Westfall et al. (2019). In the context of line emission, it is particularly important to note that broad-line AGN are generally not well fit. All current runs of the DAP assume a single Gaussian component per emission line, meaning that it is not currently possible to recover the broad and narrow components present in Type I AGN. This represents a notable limitation of the current DAP, and we therefore recommend users interested in Type I AGN -roughly 1% of MaNGA galaxies ) -to perform their own spectral fitting. Further recommendations and descriptions of known bugs in the DR15 DAP run are presented in Section 6.1.


## QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND ESTIMATE OF RANDOM ERRORS

In the section we address the question of whether the DAP performs a successful fit to the emission lines found in the MaNGA data. We further address the robustness of the errors provided by the DAP by making use of both idealized recovery simulations and analysis of repeat observations.


### Emission line quality fit metrics

Defining line S/N and A/N. -Several fit quality measures have been employed in the literature to describe the reliability of measured parameters for an emission line. The most used characterization of fit quality is the fractional error on the recovered line flux Err Flux /Flux, which is often quoted in terms of the 'signal-to-noise' of a line, defined as S/N line ≡ Flux/Err Flux .

(1)

A more empirical way of assessing line detection relies on quantifying how much the line protrudes above the noise level in the spectrum. This is usually measured by the amplitude over noise ratio,
A/N line ≡ Amplitude/RMS,(2)
where the amplitude refers to the best-fit Gaussian amplitude and the root-mean-square (RMS) is calculated from the residuals between the data and the model in small regions on either side of the line.

7 For the full datamodel see https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/ MANGA_SPECTRO_ANALYSIS/DRPVER/DAPVER/DAPTYPE/ PLATE/IFU/manga-LOGCUBE-DAPTYPE.html and Section 11.2 and Table 5    Line S/N as a good measure of fit quality. -In Figure 3 we plot the S/N line obtained from the DAP MAPS file versus the A/N line obtained using the DAP fit residuals around the position of the line for a sample of 300 random galaxies in DR15 (∼ 4 · 10 4 spaxels). The RMS is computed as the mean RMS in sidebands bluewards and redwards of the position of each line.8

The figure highlights the tight linear relation in log space between the two quantities across almost three dex in S/N line for strong lines spanning a large fraction of the MaNGA wavelength range. This tight relation, which shows an increase in scatter only for S/N line < 3, implies that the S/N computed by the DAP is equivalent to the more empirical A/N to very good accuracy. This scaling is indeed expected, since most emission lines in MaNGA are unresolved and their velocity dispersion is roughly comparable to one pixel in the spectral direction.

To check whether the fit residuals at the position of different emission lines are comparable with the error spectrum, we computed the χ 2 per degree of freedom (DoF) of the Gaussian fit in 15-pixel windows around the fitted position of each line center. In the right panel of Figure 3 we show the median relation between the χ 2 /DoF for each line and S/N line . All strong lines considered follow a similar relation, except [O II]λ3727, which suffers from worse χ 2 at fixed S/N line , possibly as a result of the difficulty in correctly fitting the unresolved doublet. For S/N line < 30, the other strong lines show a roughly constant χ 2 /dof ∼ 0.8. At higher S/N line , the χ 2 /dof increases sharply, up to 3 orders of magnitude. We interpret this as "template mismatch", in the sense that our Gaussian model represents an increasingly worse representation of the observed line profiles at high S/N. In this regime 8 The same sidebands are used to determine the continuum term in the computation of EW, and are listed in Table 3 of Westfall et al. (2019). the χ 2 could be lowered by fitting each emission line with more than one Gaussian component (e.g. Gallagher et al. 2018), but this goes beyond the scope of the current MaNGA DAP. We note that a similar behavior in the reduced chi-square over the full spectrum in both full-spectrum-fitting modules of the DAP, as shown in Figure 19 of Westfall et al. (2019); however, the discrepancies between model and data are orders of magnitude stronger in these small windows near each line.

In light of this discussion, we conclude that emission lines are statistically well-fit by a single Gaussian model at low S/N. Moreover, since S/N line correlates very well with the empirically derived A/N, we suggest that, despite its simplicity, S/N line is an excellent metric for the uncertainty in the fit. Henceforth, in this paper, S/N line is used instead of A/N.

The typical line S/N of MaNGA data -To conclude this section, we present in Figure 4 the S/N distribution of the same sample of spaxels used in Figure 3, which is representative of the line S/N distribution in the MaNGA data. Only spaxels with S/N > 0 are plotted; i.e., we do not plot the large number of spaxels that have no detected line emission according to our fitting procedure. Colored lines show the S/N distribution in three different radial bins. The radial variation of these S/N distributions highlight the decrease in S/N even in the strong nebular lines for R > 1.5 R e . We note that the MaNGA sample includes both star-forming and passive galaxies that are characterized by low-S/N line emission. In particular, the bimodality between star-forming and lowionisation emission-line regions (LIERs, Belfiore et al. 2016) is evident as a bimodality in the S/N of the Balmer lines, especially at small galactocentric radii.


### Idealized recovery simulations

In order to test the the presence of possible systematic errors in the recovery of emission-line parameters and the statistical correctness of the errors produced by the DAP we have carried M NGA D [SII] 6732 Figure 4. Distributions of emission-line signal-to-noise ratios for a large sample of spaxels (drawn from a random sample of 300 MaNGA galaxies in DR15). The black histogram includes all spaxels, while other histograms represent spaxels at different galactocentric distances (< 1R e : red; [1.0-1.5] R e : green; > 1.5R e :blue). In color, on the right-hand side of each plot, we list the average S/N ratio for each line in the associated radial range.

out a set of idealized recovery simulations. Four test galaxies were selected to span a wide range of stellar continuum and emission-line properties (two star-forming blue galaxies and two red LIER galaxies). Considering all four galaxies, our mock dataset consists of ∼ 5000 spaxels with S/N > 1 in Hα. The MaNGA datacube for each galaxy was fit using the DR15 version of the MaNGA DAP and the best-fit model cube, including both continuum and emission lines, was used as a template for generating 'mock' datacubes. For each spaxel in the model cube, Gaussian noise was added to the model spectrum, with a standard deviation given by the error vector in the input MaNGA data. Assuming the MaNGA DRP errors are accurate, this procedure generates mock cubes with the same noise level as the original data. Mock cubes with twice and half the noise level of the original data were also created.

All the mock cubes were run through the MaNGA DAP in the same way as real MaNGA data. In particular, the same MILES-HC stellar templates were used to generate and then fit the mock cubes. In Section 4.4 we repeat this exercise using a different template set to fit the simulated data, and discuss the effect of template mismatch.

In the ideal case, the fits to the mock datacubes would recover the input values of flux, velocity and velocity dispersion for all emission lines with no bias and the (1σ) errors for these quantities reported by the DAP should be equal to the standard deviation of the residuals between the output and input values. In other words, we expect < q in − q out >= 0 and std((q in − q out )/err out ) = 1, where angle brackets denote averaging, std is the standard deviation, q in and q out are in-put and output values for a physical quantity and err out is the DAP-provided error in q out . In this section we will refer to (q in − q out )/err out as the normalized residual for quantity q.

In Figure 5a we plot the offset between input and output fluxes (in dex) as a function of measured (output) S/N for six strong emission lines ([O II]λ3727, Hβ, [O III]λ5007, Hα, [N II]λ6584 and [S II]λ6731). The plot demonstrates the existence of a small positive bias in the recovered flux for S/N < 6, which then becomes a sizable decrease in the recovered flux for the lowest S/N levels (∼ 2-3). Overall, the ability of the code to recover the input fluxes is better than 0.05 dex (12 %) for S/N >6.

In Figure 5b,c,d we plot the normalized residuals for the flux, velocity and velocity dispersion as a function of the output S/N. The solid colored lines correspond to the median values of the normalized residuals in logarithmic bins of S/N, while the dashed lines represent the 16 th and 84 th percentiles. In all panels, in the case of perfect recovery, the median lines would lie at zero, and, assuming Gaussian errors, the 16 th and 84 th percentiles would follow horizontal lines at ±1.

From Figure 5a we observe that fluxes of all the emission lines considered are recovered with negligible bias down to S/N ∼ 1.5. More notably, the errors are also correctly estimated, since the 16 th and 84 th percentiles closely follow the ±1 lines in normalized residuals. For S/N < 1.5 the flux is systematically underestimated. At these low S/N the distribution of normalized residuals also deviates from a Gaussian, showing a long tail at low normalized residuals. We note B .  that, while different lines cover different ranges in S/N, the behavior of different lines are remarkably similar. In Figure 5b we show the normalized residuals for the emission-line velocities as a function of Hα S/N. Only the Hα line is plotted in this panel, since all the emission lines are fit with the same velocity. The figure shows that the input emission-line velocities are recovered with no bias down to S/N ∼ 1.5. However, the formal errors calculated by the DAP are underestimated for S/N < 10. In particular, at S/N ∼ 2, the output error is a factor of ∼ 3 lower than expected. At high S/N, on the other hand, the output errors are consistent with the scatter in the normalized residuals. The source of this underestimation likely lies in the fact that the formal error provided by pPXF for the gas fluxes are computed, for computational efficiency, from the covariance matrix of the gas emission templates alone. This implies that the uncertainties currently ignore the covariance between the fluxes (which are a linear parameters in the fit) and the gas kinematics (which are non-linear parameters). Proper uncertainties could be computed via bootstrapping at the expense of a significantly larger computation time, or by re-computing the covariance matrix with respect to all variables at the best fitting solution. In order to quantify this deviation we have fit the observed relation with a simple functional form
(v in − v out )/err vout = (0.8 ± 0.1) + (0.49 ± 0.07) log(SNR) −1 .
(3) The resulting fit provides a very good representation of the data and is shown in light red in Figure 5b. velocity-dispersion trends are similar to those observed for the flux, and are indeed their likely cause, since the flux is positively correlated with dispersion. We observe remarkably good agreement in both the median and 16 th and 84 th percentiles values down to S/N ∼ 1.5. Below that value the dispersion shows a larger tail of negative normalized residuals.

Overall, idealized recovery simulations with no template mismatch demonstrate that the values and errors of flux and velocity dispersion can be recovered accurately with negligible bias down to S/N ∼ 1.5. The velocities can also be recovered reliably down to low S/N, but their associated errors appear to be underestimated for S/N < 10.


### Error statistics from repeat observations

In this section, we further analyze the error statistics for the emission-line measurements provided by the DAP by using repeat observations. In DR15, 56 galaxies have been observed more than once, mainly for the purpose of testing random and systematic errors (Westfall et al. 2019, Table 1).9. After processing these galaxies through the DAP, their MAPS files were transposed into the same world coordinate system, in order to account for small shifts in the IFU bundle positions and orientations between observations. The world coordinate system is derived by the MaNGA DRP by matching the MaNGA cubes to pre-existing SDSS photometry in the advanced astrometry module (Law et al. 2016, Section 8), and therefore takes into account small shifts and rotations of the IFU fiber bundles. In comparing repeat observations we do not, however, take into account possible changes in the seeing conditions. Similar to the procedure adopted for analyzing the recovery simulations in the previous section, we calculate the normalized residuals as a function of S/N. Since for repeat observations we do not know the true value of any physical quantity, we define the normalized residual as (q 1 −q 2 )/(err 2 1 +err 2 2 ) 1/2 , where 1 and 2 refer to a pair of repeat galaxies and err is the error in quantity q. Considering all repeat galaxies, we obtain a sample of ∼ 5·10 4 pairs of spaxels with two independent measurements with S/N > 1 for Hα.

In Figure 6a we show the normalized flux residual as a function of S/N of the first galaxy in the pair. Following the same graphical conventions as in Figure 5, the solid colored lines represent the median while the dashed colored lines represent the 16 th and 84 th percentiles as a function of S/N. The median residual is found to be close to zero. The 16 th and 84 th percentiles, on the other hand, are found to be close to ±1 at S/N ∼ 2 and show a systematic deviation towards larger values at higher S/N. This deviation is particularly evident for S/N > 10.

In Figures 6b and 6c we show the normalized residuals as a function of S/N for the velocity and velocity dispersion. For velocity, the errors are underestimated at all S/N, with the worst discrepancy at low S/N, similarly to what was found in our study of idealized simulations in the last section. Different from what was seen in the previous section, the errors also diverge from expectations at high S/N (S/N > 20-30), while they appear to be underestimated by a factor less than 2 in the range S/N = [6,50]. The velocity dispersion appears to be much better behaved, with no evidence for large error underestimation until S/N>100. Interestingly, for S/N = [1, 2] the errors appear to be overestimated. Figure 6d shows the distribution of normalized residuals for six strong lines (see legend) in the S/N range [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. The gray dashed line shows a normalized Gaussian of unit standard deviation, which represents the theoretical expectation in case of ideal error measurements. In Figure 6d we show as vertical black dashed lines the 16 th and 84 th percentiles of the observed distribution for Hα (1.22 and −1.35 respectively). We note that, although the data presents slightly non-Gaussian tails, it is well-fit to first order by a Gaussian with standard deviation 1.25 (fit not shown). Figure 6e is the same as Figure 6d, but represents the S/N range [10-100]. As already evident in Figure 6a, at this S/N level the errors are either underestimated by a factor of 2-3, or some other systematic enters in the repeat observations comparison.

Since this large error underestimation is not seen in the idealized recovery simulation we consider possible systematic effects which could cause this. First, as already seen in Section 3.1, at S/N > 20-30, our Gaussian model may be insufficient to accurately fit the line profiles in real data, leading to higher normalized residuals and, possibly, underestimated errors. Secondly, regions of bright line emission tend to be clumpy, and the measured fluxes are therefore particularly sensitive to differences in PSF. In this case the increased error in flux is due to intrinsic scatter in the amplitude, and not to larger errors in the recovered velocity dispersion, which would be in agreement with the findings from Figure 6c. The same effect would be caused by small astrometric misalignments between repeat observations. We gained some insight into these issues by visually inspecting difference and normalized residuals maps for different pairs of repeat observations. This exercise clearly revealed that the largest normalized residuals are indeed associated with bright and clumpy line emission. We have therefore performed a simple test to quantify the effect of astrometric offsets and PSF differences. One of the galaxies showing the largest differences in normalized residuals was selected as an example. For this galaxy we considered the output of the MaNGA astrometry module, which matches the MaNGA IFU data to the underlying SDSS photometry in order to correct for small deviations of the rotation and centroid position of the MaNGA IFU ferrules in a given exposure due to the mechanical tolerance of the ferrule and rotational clocking pin holes. We artificially added random error to the best-fit astrometric solution, consistent with the uncertainty calculated by the astrometry module (typically about 0.25 • and 0.1" for the rotational and translational components respectively). A datacube was then produced, following the usual MaNGA  reduction recipies, and fit using the DAP. We compared the output produced by this datacube with additional astrometric error to reference datacube generated for DR15. At low S/N the dispersion in line fluxes between the two datacubes is negligible, but it flares at high S/N in a fashion consistent with that observed in Figure 6a. In particular we find that astrometric errors consistent with those expected by registering MaNGA data to SDSS photometry are sufficient to explain the observed increase in the error budget in repeat observations.


### Summary and recommendations with regards to errors

In summary, recovery simulations demonstrate that the errors for flux and velocity dispersion of different emission lines behave in a statistically correct fashion down to S/N ∼ 1.5. Errors in the velocity are underestimated for S/N < 10, and the source of this discrepancy is not know at the time of writing. Equation 3 quantifies this underestimation and can be utilized to rescale the errors based on the outcome of the recovery simulation, should the user decide to do so.

These trends are largely confirmed by the analysis of repeat observations. Repeat observations, however, also show underestimation of the errors in the high S/N regime. We have demonstrated that this trend can be entirely explained by small astrometric errors in individual exposures, which are consistent with the uncertainties derived by the MaNGA DRP astrometric registration routine. In light of this discussion, we leave it up to the user to consider whether adding this extra error contribution is advisable for their specific science goal.


## SYSTEMATIC ERRORS FROM THE MODELING OF THE CONTINUUM

In the section we address the systematics on emissionline properties that arise from the modeling of the continuum. We present MILES-HC, the stellar library used to fit the MaNGA data in DR15, and discuss the differences in the recovered emission-line properties obtained using several different SSPs.


### Stellar and SSP template libraries

In the following section we briefly outline the characteristics of the spectral libraries that we will discuss and compare in this paper. Forty-nine such groups are generated and a composite spectrum is obtained for each group as the average of the spectra of the contributing stars. These 49 spectra were visually inspected and 7 of them were removed due to artifacts and/or the presence of emission lines (in flaring late-type stars), leading to a total of 42 stellar templates. The resolution of the MILES library has been independently derived by Beifiori et al. (2011) andFalcón-Barroso et al. (2011) and is 2.54 Å (FWHM). This library is used in generating all the DAP DR15 data products.


## The Maraston 2011 SSP models based on MILES (M11-MILES) -

These SSP are generated using the MILES stellar library by the Maraston stellar-population-synthesis code (Maraston & Strömbäck 2011).10 One hundred ten models are used with ages ranging from 6.5 Myr to 15 Gyr, 3 metallicities (Z=0.01, 0.02, 0.04) and a Salpeter IMF. The spectral resolution is the same as that of the MILES library (2.54 Å FWHM).  Cenarro et al. (2001). Stellar spectra from the Indo-US stellar library are used to fill in the gap left between the MILES and and CaT spectral ranges and also to extend towards the blue and red the wavelength coverage of the MILES and CaT libraries respectively. The spectral resolution is the same as the MILES library, as the higher-resolution CaT and Indo-US libraries are convolved to the MILES spectral resolution. The MaNGA VAC generated by the Pipe3D team also uses a subset of MIUSCAT templates for spectral fitting, although the exact set of templates differs from the ones described above.


## The Bruzual and Charlot SSP models based on STELIB (BC03)

-This is the set of 40 Bruzual & Charlot (2003) models used in the MPA-JHU catalog for the SDSS DR4.12 The SSP templates cover a range of 10 ages (0.005, 0.025, 0.101, 0.286, 0.640, 0.904, 1.434, 2.500, 5.000, 10.000 Gyr) and 4 metallicities (Z = 0.008, 0.004, 0.02, 0.05) using a Chabrier IMF. The SSP models are based on the STELIB stellar library (Le Borgne et al. 2003) and have nominal spectral resolution of 2.3 Å. These SSP models are different from the BC03 SSP based on MILES used to produce the MPA-JHU valueadded catalogue for later data releases, such as the latest DR8 version.13


### Choosing between stars and SSPs

In this section we investigate the consistency between the MILES-HC stellar library used in DR15 and the SSP models described in the subsection above. SSP models prescribe parameterized combinations or interpolations between elements of stellar libraries based on physical models of stellar 10 www.maraston.eu/M11 11 http://miles.iac.es/pages/webtools/tune-ssp-models.php 12 https://www.mpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR4/ 13 www.sdss.org/dr12/spectro/galaxy_mpajhu B .   interiors, atmospheres, and their evolution (isochrones). To the extent that these physical models are incomplete or simply inaccurate, one may worry about whether SSP and stellar spectra are consistent in both overall shape and in the details of their absorption features. SSP models based on observed stellar libraries mitigate, e.g., incomplete line-lists in synthetic spectra, but suffer problems due to library incompleteness and stellar misclassification. Library incompleteness is a general concern for all continuum-fitting methods, and it is the specific concern motivating the work in this section.

In particular, the lack of hot (O-type) stars in the MILES library potentially undermines our ability to fit young stellar populations with MILES-HC. The hierarchical clustering performed on the spectra may further dilute the blue continua of the few B-stars present in MILES. While O-star spectra are largely featureless, their very blue continua cannot be reproduced by a linear sum of other stellar spectra. A common solution to this problem, within the pPXF framework, is to allow the inclusion of additive and/or multiplicative polynomials in the fit. These polynomials are generally of low order M NGA D A P : E L 15

to avoid any effect of the polynomial on the spectral features of individual absorption lines. However, hot stars do have some critical features, notably in their hydrogen and helium lines that have distinct and systematic changes with temperature. These changes in stellar absorption lines include both the equivalent width, the core width (due to rotation and winds), and the relative strength and shape of the wings (due to the Stark effect). None of these are modified by multiplicative polynomials, and only the equivalent width (not the shape) can be modulated by additive polynomials. Further, because of the different and non-linear temperature dependence of these features it is not possible to accurately simulate spectra containing O-stars with a library which does not include these stars. For a library with such a deficiency, we would expect to see Balmer lines which are too narrow and a deficiency of He absorption. Since this will lead to systematics in the continuum model at the location of key emission lines, the amplitude of such systematics is important to assess.

We therefore test the ability of the MILES-HC library to reproduce different stellar populations by fitting the BC03 SSP models of different ages (and solar metallicity) with MILES-HC spectra. The fit has been performed in three ways:

(1) with no polynomials; (2) with an 8th-order additive polynomial; and (3) with an 8th-order multiplicative polynomial. Aside from the polynomial type, we perform this fit in the same way as the first (i.e., the stellar kinematics) fitting stage of the DAP. In each case, we compute the residual between the best-fit model and the input SSP, and the resulting RMS over the wavelength range 3700-7400 Å.

The fractional RMS (i.e. the standard deviation of output -input/ input) calculated over ∼ 40 Å windows is shown in Figure 7. The figure demonstrates the overall shape of the BC03 SSPs are well-fit, except at very young ages, where polynomials improve the fit at the blue end of the spectrum, most notably below 4000 Å. Old ages (> a few Gyr) show an increased fractional RMS from the blue edge of the wavelength range considered to around 5500 Å, possibly due to abundance variations that may affect the absorption depth of different metal features. It is also possible to pick our specific Balmer absorption lines as regions of high fractional RMS. Hα and Hβ stand out as problematic, especially for the youngest ages. The addition of polynomials leads to an overall improvement in the fit quality, both at young and old ages, especially in the blue.

Despite the overall good agreement in spectral shape, we further investigated the fit quality around the main Balmer and helium absorption lines, where we expect the most noticeable issues to arise from the absence of adequately hot stars in the MILES-HC library. Figure 8 again compares the fits of the MILES-HC library to the BC03 SSPs for ages of 5 and 25 Myr with and without polynomials. This figure is worth careful scrutiny.

Inspection reveals MILES-HC under-predicts the hydrogen line-depths increasingly for lower-order lines. This is mostly ameliorated by either additive or multiplicative polynomials, which do a good job at matching the wings but fail to match the core. The same relative statements are true for the 25 Myr SSP, but the amplitudes of the differences are decreased, i.e., the MILES-HC fit is substantially better on its own without polynomials. In contrast, the MILES-HC fits over-predict He I and under predict He II lines for BC03 for both ages. Polynomials do little to help remedy the mismatch in equivalent width and often degrade the quality of the fit.

These observations of the mismatch between MILES-HC and the BC03 SSP models run counter to our expectations listed above for an insufficient representation of very hot stars. Consequently it is difficult to conclude that MILES-HC is in this way deficient. That said, the addition of polynomials in some cases improves detailed fits to specific absorption lines (hydrogen), while at the same time degrading other lines (helium).

We can interpret the over-fitting of the He I and the underfitting of He II lines as due to the lack of very hot O stars in MILES-HC. B stars are the hottest stars in the library, and they do not have He II lines. If MILES-HC lacks templates with strong He II lines, then the fit will use more B stars to compensate for the spectral shape and and up over-fitting He I, while still not producing the He II features.

A detailed accounting of the stellar templates (and their weights) that go into the specific SSPs would be one way to make progress on this question, but this critical 'deconstruction' of SSPs is beyond the scope of this paper.

We conclude that even with additive and/or multiplicative polynomials MILES-HC is likely to have small systematic residuals in the cores of the hydrogen lines that lead to emission-line overestimates at the very youngest ages. The systematics for helium lines are more significant and varied, and in some cases are minimized without including polynomials.


### The effects of the continuum model on line fluxes

In order to explicitly test the effect on measured emissionline fluxes caused by the use of different stellar-continuum models we fit a subset of DR15 MaNGA datacubes with the three sets of SSPs discussed in Section 4.1, in addition to the MILES-HC fit performed in DR15. In particular, we used SSPs to perform the second fitting stage in the DAP, but not for the extraction of the stellar kinematics, for which stars are generally recommended. When necessary, the difference between the intrinsic spectral resolution of the MILES stars and that of the SSP templates used for the second fitting stage has been taken into account.

The SSP fits were carried out for a sample of 15 galaxies, evenly sampling the NUV − r versus log(M /M ) plane, in order to have access to a wide variety of stellar populations. We only considered galaxies with line emission (including extended LIER galaxies on the red sequence). Considering the entire galaxy subsample, we obtain ∼ 2 · 10 4 spaxels with Hα SNR > 1.

In Figure 9 we compare the emission-line fluxes obtained using MILES-HC for both fitting stages (i.e., the DR15 data products) with the fluxes obtained after switching to an SSP template for the second fitting stage. The flux ratios are   presented as a function of line SNR for different strong lines. The dashed gray lines represent the level at which the flux difference is comparable to the random error. Figure 9 shows a number of interesting features. For the Balmer lines (Hα and Hβ are shown in the figure), different templates give systematically different line fluxes because of the different best-fit stellar Balmer absorptions, especially at low S/N. MIUSCAT prefers deeper Balmer absorption, leading to larger Balmer-line fluxes than MILES-HC. BC03 and M11-MILES lead to better agreement with DR15 for Hα but show significant differences in Hβ. It is interesting to note that the systematic discrepancies are substantial (up to 0.1 dex at S/N = 2 between DR15 and MIUSCAT). They are, however, smaller than the random errors at low S/N, while they become comparable (or larger) than the random error at high S/N. We have checked the behavior of the flux differences M NGA D  Figure 10 we show some example fits to the spectral regions around Hα and the [N II] doublet for the central spaxel of four galaxies (low-mass blue: 7815-6101; massive blue: 8138-12704; low-mass red: 8329-1901; high-mass red: 8258-6102) spanning a range of properties in the NUV − r versus log(M /M ) plane. These example fits highlight the previously discussed differences in the core of the Hα line, but also the resulting effect on the nearby [N II] lines, which are the outer edge of the Balmer absorption wings. For example, the BC03 templates generate best-fit models that have substantially different line wings from those of other template sets, therefore affecting the [N II] flux in addition to Hα.

Although these flux discrepancies are smaller than the random error, they are systematic and behave differently for the different lines considered, therefore leading to biases in the derived line ratios. In Figure 11 we show the differences in dex for several line ratios and other derived quantities between the cases fit with SSPs and DR15 as a function of EW(Hα). In the first row we show the Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ) and two classical BPT (Baldwin et al. 1981) line ratios ([N II]/Hα and [O III]/Hβ). At low S/N, the Balmer decrement measured with MIUSCAT and M11-MILES differs substantially from that inferred in DR15 or using BC03. Estimating E(B − V) using an intrinsic ratio Hα/Hβ = 2.86 and a Calzetti (2001) extinction curve, deviations up to 0.1 dex are evident at EW(Hα) ∼ 2 Å, growing worse at even lower EW. Regarding the BPT line ratios, [N II]/Hα is relatively unaffected by template choice, possibly because of the vicinity of the two lines means they are affected by the bestfit continuum shape in a correlated way. [O III]/Hβ, on the other hand, displays significant differences for low EW lines (there is a 0.2 dex difference between MIUSCAT and DR15 at EW(Hα) ∼ 2 Å). These biases will have a measurable impact on the BPT diagram positions of low EW regions, which tend to be associated with LIER emission and diffuse ionized gas.

In the bottom row of Figure 11 we also show two metallicity-sensitive indices often employed in the literature, O3N2 = ([O III]λ5007/Hβ)/([N II]λ6583/Hα) (Pettini & Pagel 2004) (Pagel et al. 1979). While O3N2 is relatively insensitive to dust extinction, we correct the measured line fluxes for extinction when computing R23. It is evident from the figure that discrepancies larger than a tenth of a dex are present at low EW for both indicators. A cut on EW(Hα) > 6 is sometimes performed in studies of ISM metallicity in order to minimize the contamination from gas not directly associated with H II regions (Sánchez et al. 2014).

Here we show this threshold as a dashed black line for these two indicators in Figure 11, demonstrating for larger EWs the systematic effects from the choice of continuum templates are non-negligible. This exercise demonstrates that care is needed when comparing results from IFU surveys calculating emission-line fluxes with different underlying stellar or SSP models.


### Simulating the effect of template mismatch

The aim of this section is not to select the 'correct' set of templates, but simply to quantify the effect of different templates on the resulting emission-line fluxes. In general, we cannot determine which set of templates is the correct one for our galaxy data, so we devise an artificial exercise similar to the recovery simulation presented in Section 3.2 to study the effect of using the 'wrong templates' in the presence of noise.

In particular, we take the best-fit model from the previous section based on a set of SSP templates and add noise in the same way as was done in Section 3.2. Here we discuss the results of using mock datacubes generated using the MIUS-CAT best-fit models which are then fit using the standard DR15 approach (i.e., using the MILES-HC library). In light of the results of the previous section, we expect the recovered Balmer line fluxes to be lower than the input ones on average, given the preference for MIUSCAT to fit deeper Balmer absorption features.

In Figure 12 demonstrates this effect. The recovered Hα and Hβ fluxes are indeed systematically lower than the input ones. It is interesting to note, however, that while the median flux is systematically biased, the 16th and 84th percentiles still approximately correspond to ±1 with respect to the median, indicating that template mismatch does not dramatically affect the statistical validity of the emission-line flux errors. At low S/N, we also observe a bias in the recovered fluxes, in the sense that the flux tends to be under-estimated, as already noted in Section 3.2 (see Figure 5a).


## SYSTEMATICS FROM ALGORITHMIC CHOICES

In the section we address the systematic errors on emissionline parameters that may result from specific algorithmic choices. In particular, we study the effect and importance of the polynomial corrections adopted in DR15 and critically assess the strategy of simultaneously fitting the continuum and emission lines in the second fitting stage of the DAP. We also explore different schemes for tying the velocity and velocity dispersion of different emission lines and compare them to the approach we have followed in DR15.


### Multiplicative polynomials

In this section we assess the role and importance of multiplicative polynomials in the second fitting stage of the DAP (the simultaneous fitting of continuum and emission lines). A complementary discussion of the role of additive polynomials during the first fitting stage of the DAP (stellar kinematics) is presented in Section 7.3.3 of Westfall et al. (2019). We remind the reader that the multiplicative polynomials are only applied to the stellar-continuum templates, and not to the    Figure 14. The median multiplicative polynomial correction for one massive elliptical test galaxy (8258-6102), fit using different stellar and SSP templates. An upturn in the polynomial correction is evident for λ < 4000 for the DR15 (MILES-HC, in black) and the M11 MILES (in blue) templates. We attribute this upturn to an issue in the flux calibration of the MILES stellar library. Interestingly the same effect is not as evident for the MIUSCAT (in red) templates, which are also based on MILES stars. The shape of the downturn is independent of the polynomial order used (in orange we show the result of using 7th-order multiplicative polynomials and MILES-HC). In the far red (λ > 9000 ) we note a red upturn, picked up both by BC03 (in green) and MIUSCAT. For the moment we cannot exclude that this red upturn is an artifact of the MaNGA flux calibration.

this issue here as a check on the quality of our continuum model and for its relation to the overall flux calibration of the MaNGA survey.


#### The role of polynomials

The inclusion of polynomials during the pPXF fit may be advantageous for several reasons.

1. Multiplicative polynomials can compensate for residual differences in the relative flux calibration of the science data with respect to the stellar templates. Assuming the spectral templates are perfectly calibrated (and in presence of negligible extinction), one may use the shape of the recovered polynomials to test the quality of the flux calibration of the data.

2. Polynomials can mimic the shape of canonical extinction curves.

3. Polynomials can provide low-order corrections to the stellar-population models, which may be especially valuable when theoretical stellar spectra are used. In addition, they can help to reproduce the shape of the spectra of stars that are not present or under-represented in the library used (as we have discussed in Section 4.2).


#### The typical shape of the polynomial correction in DR15

In this section, therefore, we start by looking at the typical shapes of the multiplicative polynomials used in the second fitting stage for the DR15 DAP run. To do so, we selected a random sample of 100 DR15 galaxies and reconstructed the multiplicative polynomials used in each of their spaxels. In Figure 13 we show the shape of the median multiplicative correction applied as a function of restframe wavelength. The sample of galaxies is subdivided into two mass bins (red for log(M /M ) > 10; blue for log(M /M ) < 10) and the shaded areas correspond to the 16th and 84th percentiles of the distribution. We also show in black the expected multiplicative correction for a Calzetti extinction curve and two values of E(B − V).14 The extinction curves are scaled arbitrarily to the median of the polynomial corrections to highlight the similarity in relative shape.

The trends observed in the figure can be qualitatively interpreted as follows. The massive bin contains a larger number of passive galaxies, which are largely devoid of gas and thus suffer lower extinction. The shape of the polynomials are consistent with the values of E(B − V) measured for the continuum by full spectral fitting in the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies .


#### Deviations from smooth polynomial shapes and consequences for flux calibration

The key features in Figure 13 are the deviations from the expected smooth extinction curves, namely the upturn in the mean correction at the very blue end of the MaNGA wavelength range and a similar downturn redder than 7000 Å.


## B .

We initially associated these features with potential problems with the MaNGA flux calibration. After further consideration, however, this is unlikely for the following reasons. First, the upturn in the blue occurs at different observed wavelengths for galaxies at different redshifts. For example, if one considers massive galaxies in the MaNGA primary and secondary samples, which are selected in the same fashion but separated by a small redshift interval, the blue upturn moves to longer observed wavelength in the secondary sample. If the upturn was due to imperfections in the MaNGA flux calibration derived from standard-star spectra, it would always appear at the same observed wavelength. Secondly, the downturn observed redder than 7000 Å occurs in the middle of the MaNGA spectral coverage (but at the edge of the spectral coverage of MILES-HC) and is therefore more likely to be originating from the MILES-HC than the MaNGA data.

In order to test whether imperfect relative flux calibration of the MILES-HC library is responsible for the deviations observed in Figure 13 we selected one test galaxy (a massive red galaxy, 8258-6102, with good S/N throughout) and examined the stacked polynomial shapes obtained after fitting the galaxy with different template sets. The results are presented in Figure 14. In addition, we also varied the degree of multiplicative polynomials from 8 to 7 using MILES-HC, to test whether changing from odd to even parity would produce a change in the symmetry of the recovered multiplicative correction. As is evident from Figure 14, this did not occur. It is interesting to note that between 4000 Å and 7000 Å MILES-HC (labeled DR15), M11-MILES, MIUSCAT (all based on MILES stars) and BC03 (based on STELLIB) agree to better than 10%. Bluer than 4000 Å BC03 presents a downturn, while both M11-MILES and MILES-HC show an upturn. MIUSCAT, on the other hand, gives rise to a flattening. It should also be noted that the downturn at 7000 Å is present both in MILES-HC and M11-MILES, pointing towards a problem with the MILES stars. We cannot exclude, however, that pPXF exaggerates these small inaccuracies due to edge effects (i.e. the difficulty to fix the shape of the polynomials correction at the edge of the wavelength range). It is also possible that MILES-HC suffers simply by the lack of hot stars, including blue horizontal branch stars. These stellar types may have been accounted differently by different SSP models, generating the discrepancy observed between BC03, MIUSCAT and M11-MILES at the blue edge of the optical wavelength range.

Interestingly the SSP templates which extend redder than 9000 Å show the need for an upward correction to match the MaNGA data. The presence of this red upturn has been identified via visual inspection in some of the MaNGA spectra. Since this spectral range is not fit in DR15, we postpone further study of this potential systematic effect.


### The combined effect of masking and polynomials

The MaNGA DAP implements simultaneous fitting of emission-line and continuum templates following the recommendation from previous work (Sarzi et al. 2005;Oh et al. 2011). Sarzi et al. (2005), in particular, demonstrated the advantage of this algorithmic choice when dealing with the limited wavelength range of the SAURON data, where the emission lines lie in close vicinity to the key metallicity and age-sensitive features. In Section 4.3, however, we have demonstrated that, even by performing simultaneous fitting, residual degeneracies between Balmer absorption and line emission are still present, leading to noticeably different best-fit models when using different template libraries. In this section, therefore, we perform some illustrative tests to evaluate the impact of the masking on the recovered best-fit continuum under the Balmer lines.

We first examine the difference between the best-fit continua obtained by the first and the second fitting stages in the DAP for the central spaxels in four test galaxies (Figure 15, same galaxies as in Figure 10). A difference between the two best-fit stellar-continuum models in this comparison may be due to either the effect of masking (emission-line regions are masked in the first fit but not in the second) or the difference in the use of polynomials (additive polynomials in the first fit and multiplicative polynomials in the second fit). In Figure 15 we plot the difference between the two best-fit models normalised by the input spectrum. The largest deviations (∼1-2%) are seen in regions corresponding to strong absorption lines (like the Na doublet, evident in all the four examples except the low-mass blue galaxy) and the Balmer absorption lines. However, in the case of Balmer lines, the differences can be both positive or negative. We attribute this behavior to the different implementation of polynomials in the two fitting stages. In the case of the low-mass blue galaxy, where the most prominent absorption features are the Balmer lines, additive polynomials lead to shallower absorption-line profiles, which result in positive residuals at the positions of the Balmer lines in Figure 15. For the higher-mass galaxies other metal absorption lines dominate the spectrum, and therefore determine the shape of the polynomials, causing both positive, null or negative residuals around the Balmer lines.

A cleaner test to isolate the effect of masking is to apply the same type of polynomials to both the first and second fitting stage. We have therefore repeated the exercise just described by using 8th-order multiplicative polynomials for both fitting stages. The resulting normalized flux differences are shown in Figure 16 and look substantially different from Figure 15. Now the differences around metal absorption lines are reduced and the Balmer lines correspond to the largest residuals (still, however, of the order of ∼ 1 − 2%). These are stronger for the high-order Balmer lines (in particular Hδ and Hγ), and decrease in amplitude for the low-order Balmer lines. Integrating over the whole line profile the systematic differences in Hα flux are less than 2%, which is negligible in most cases when compared to the discrepancies caused by changes in the template library. However the changes in measured fluxes are more substantial for the high-order lines.

There is an interesting difference between the young spectrum of the low-mass blue galaxy, which displays deeper Balmer absorption in the second (unmasked) fit, and the other spectra characterized by older stellar populations, which show M NGA D Spectral differences between the first and second fit iteration in DR15 low mass blue massive blue low mass red massive red Figure 15. The spectral differences between the best-fit stellar continuum in the first fitting stage of the DAP and that of the second fitting stage (note that individual objects have been offset vertically for clarity). The four difference spectra shown are taken from the central regions of four different test galaxies, spanning a range in stellar mass and color (low-mass blue: 7815-6101; massive blue: 8138-12704; low-mass red: 8329-1901; massive red: 8258-6102). The spectral differences are normalized by the input spectrum. The first fitting stage masks regions potentially contaminated by emission lines and allows the use of additive polynomials while the second fitting stage performs simultaneous fitting of gas and stellar templates and makes use of multiplicative polynomials. The main differences between the best fits from the two stages are seen in regions of strong Balmer and metal absorption. Spectral differences between the first and second fit iteration using the same poly. type low-mass blue massive blue low-mass red massive red Figure 16. Same as Figure 15, but using 8th-order multiplicative polynomials in both fitting stages of the DAP. The difference between the two best-fit models is, therefore, only driven by the masking of the emission lines in the first stage (in the second stage emission lines are fit at the same time as the continuum). Small differences (< 2 % of the Hα flux) can be seen in the best-fit models at the position of the Balmer lines.

B .

shallower absorption in the second fit. The reasons for this difference must be related to how the inclusion of the masked regions affects the best-fit template mix. In the future, it would be of interest to repeat the same exercise in the context of stellar-population synthesis and assess the effect of masking on the recovery of stellar-population parameters, which is likely more significant than the effect on the emission lines.


### The choice of tying emission line kinematic parameters

When several emission lines are fit across a large wavelength range, whether or not to tie the kinematic parameters for different lines becomes a debatable problem. In general, tying the velocities and velocity dispersions of different lines is an advantage in the low-S/N regime, where stronger lines contribute much more to the overall χ 2 , therefore effectively determining the kinematic parameters of weaker ones. Several reason exist, however, to be skeptical of tying kinematic parameters. First, without an accurate knowledge of the linespread function (LSF) and its change with wavelength it is not possible to correctly fix the astrophysical velocity dispersions of widely separated lines. Likewise, small errors in the wavelength calibration can induce problems when fitting all emission lines with a common velocity. Finally, there are astrophysical reasons to expect emission lines emitted by different ionic species in different ionization stages to have different kinematics.

In this section we test the effect of making different assumptions regarding the tying of kinematic parameters. We considered the sample of 15 galaxies described in Section 4.3, selected to evenly sample the NUV − r versus log(M /M ) plane. We consider the schemes described below and summarized in Table 2.

All parameters free (Test 0) -In this scheme, all velocities, dispersions and amplitudes of the different emission lines are fit individually as free parameters.

Tie velocities (DR15) -In this scheme, the velocities of all lines are tied together, while the velocity dispersions are fit independently. This tying scheme may be beneficial when uncertainties in the LSF prevent the tying of the astrophysical dispersions and is the scheme adopted in the DR15 run.

Tie velocities in three groups (Test 1) -In this scheme we define three groups of emission lines: The velocities of different lines are tied within the same group. None of the velocity dispersions were tied. This scheme is a variant of the DR15 run that allows for different astrophysical velocities for lines of different species and ionization states.

Tie velocities and dispersions in three groups (Test 2) -The scheme is the same as the previous one, but we tied both velocity and velocity dispersions for the lines in the same group.

All parameters tied (Test 3) -In this scheme we tie the velocity and velocity dispersions of all lines together.

In all schemes, except the first one (test 0) we impose the flux ratios set by atomic physics when fitting the line doublets of [O I] In Figure 17 we show the flux ratio (in dex) between each of the test runs and DR15, as a function of line S/N for different emission lines. The thick gray dashed lines correspond to the deviations expected given the random errors in the flux measurements.

We notice that for S/N < 2, Test 0 (all parameters free) gives larger fluxes than DR15 for all lines considered. Figure 18 shows a similar plot but for the velocity dispersions, demonstrating that the deviations towards larger fluxes are accompanied by a lower sigmas. This may be due to the fact that, when velocities are not tied, the algorithm may be fitting noise spikes at low S/N. These spikes tend to have a width of one pixel, leading to smaller dispersions and higher amplitudes.

Test 1, where velocities are allowed to vary within emission line groups, is virtually indistinguishable from DR15 in terms of fluxes and sigmas.

Finally, Test 2 and Test 3 (i.e. the runs where sigmas are tied) produce marginally lower sigmas and fluxes than DR15.

In Figure 19 we show the velocity difference between DR15 and different tests runs for Hα [N II]λλ6584 and [O III]λλ5007. It is evident that there is no systematic velocity shift if velocities are tied in groups rather than all together. If the velocities are not tied (or tied in groups) the scatter in the resulting velocities with respect to DR15 is comparable to the random error (estimated in DR15) for the metal (both high and low-ionization) lines, but smaller for the Balmer lines. Overall the consistency of the velocities determined following different tying prescriptions validates the DR15 approach and demonstrates that the MaNGA data does not suffer from any detectable systematic in the wavelength calibration (see also Figure 19 of Law et al. 2016), which would necessarily invalidate some of our tying schemes.

Finally in Figure 20 we show the ratio (in dex) between the Hα velocity dispersion and that of other Balmer (in black) and metal (in blue) emission lines as a function of wavelength, after subtracting in quadrature the DR15 estimate of the instrumental velocity dispersion. Only spaxels with S/N > 10 on the specific line are considered.  Table 2). The gray dashed lines correspond to the scatter expected considering the random errors. The largest systematic discrepancies between the tying strategy implemented in DR15 and other test runs are found for S/N < 6.  Table 2) and DR15. The gray dashed lines correspond to the scatter expected considering the random errors.   Here we briefly summarize our recommendations for usage of the DAP DR15 output regarding emission lines.

Users whose science goal would benefit from the best spatial resolution afforded by MaNGA should use the output from the hybrid binning scheme contained in the HYB10-GAU-MILESHC folder. If, on the other hand, one requires the emission-line properties to be computed on the same (Voronoi) binning scheme as the continuum the output in VOR10-GAU-MILESHC should be used instead.

All of the emission-line maps are included as extensions in the DAP MAPS files. Each extension corresponds to a 3D array, where two dimensions correspond to the on-sky spatial pixels and the third dimension allows the user to choose a specific emission line. These extensions can be opened with a standard fits viewer (e.g. DS915, QFitsView16) and appear as a datacube. The correspondence between the index in the MAPS file extension and the line name is given in the extension header. A practical example of how to perform this association in an automatic fashion in python is given below. We strongly encourage users to take close consideration of the masks provided in the MAPS file. In the python programming language masked arrays, as implemented in the in numpy package, are particularly suitable for the task of manipulating data with associated mask information. Users interested in a comprehensive software framework in the python language to access and manipulate the MaNGA data are encouraged to use our purpose-built Marvin package (Cherinka et al. 2018). Visualisation tools for the DAP data products are also directly available on the Marvin web interface at https://dr15.sdss.org/marvin/.

Finally we warn users of the following bugs which were discovered in the DR15 DAP output. These problems have already been resolved at the software level, and the DAP output will be corrected in the next data release. 


## The Hζ line parameters are unreliable in DR15.

This is due to a blend with the nearby He I line at 3889.749 Å (vacuum) which was not included in the line list for DR15, but will be included in future releases. We recommend against use of this line in DR15.


### Future work

There are many ways to improve on DR15 with respect to the emission-line properties. First, we would like to transition away from MILES-HC towards a stellar library derived from MaStar spectra (Yan et al. 2018). MaStar is a new library of stellar spectra observed with the MaNGA instrument suite at APO, and offers several advantages over MILES, in terms of its carefully controlled flux calibration, wider coverage in terms of stellar parameters, wider wavelength range and similar LSF to the MaNGA galaxy spectra. The generation of B .

a hierarchically clustered set of MaStar spectra for kinematics extraction and the production of a new generation of SSP templates based on MaStar spectra are currently being developed. We anticipate incorporating a 'MaStar-HC' library and/or a set of MaStar-based SSP templates for the simultaneous fitting of continuum and emission lines in the second fitting stage of the DAP. The use of continuum templates with wider wavelength coverage would also allow us to provide accurate modeling of the continuum for the [S III]λ8831,9071 9533 lines in the near-IR, which are sensitive tracers of the ionization parameter of the ISM (Kewley & Dopita 2002).

A detailed characterization of the MaNGA LSF is currently underway and will be described in a forthcoming publication (Law et al., in prep). As our knowledge of the MaNGA LSF improves, we envision using line-tying strategies that reflect our confidence in our ability to simultaneously constrain both velocity and velocity dispersions for physically motivated groups of lines without suffering from systematic error at low velocity dispersion.

Further improvements may include a treatment of multi-Gaussian kinematic component and broad emission lines in AGN. While automatically detecting very broad emission lines (σ > 1000 km s −1 ) is a relatively simple task, characterizing the significance of line asymmetries and/or additional kinematic component for millions of low S/N, mediumresolution MaNGA spaxels represents a significant task, likely to remain outside the scope of a general-purpose data analysis pipeline like the DAP. Gallagher et al. (2018) describes the first attempt of this type of analysis on the MaNGA data.

We do not expect further substantial developments of the MaNGA DAP to be project-led, but rather community-driven. Members of the astronomical community interested in adapting the MaNGA DAP to their own specific data format and scientific interests are welcome to make use of the DAP source code, which is publicly released on GitHub.17 7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have tested the algorithmic choices and output produced by the MaNGA DAP with regard to the quality of the stellar-continuum modeling and the determination of emission-line fluxes and kinematics. We have further described and assessed the choices made for SDSS DR15, which corresponds to the first public release of DAP data products. We hope that the analysis presented in this paper will serve both as a reference for the community interested in the intricacies of spectral fitting and to those who wish to use the high-level data products from the MaNGA survey released in DR15.

The main conclusions of this work are summarized below.

1. We derive a tight relationship between the amplitudeto-noise and the ratio between measured flux and flux error (S/N). We therefore consider the S/N as an appropriate metric for emission lines in MaNGA. For S/N < 17 https://github.com/sdss/mangadap 30 emission lines are statistically well-fit by the DAP, with a χ 2 /Dof ∼ 0.8. An increase in χ 2 /Dof is observed at higher S/N, which we expect is associated with template mismatch (i.e., non-Gaussian line profiles are more well measured at high S/N).

2. We generate mock datacubes with realistic error prescriptions and demonstrate that the estimated errors for flux and velocity dispersion behave in a statistically correct way down to S/N ∼ 1.5. Errors in the velocity are underestimated for S/N < 10, and we provide an empirical formula (Equation 3) to correct this underestimation.

3. We analyze the error statistics from repeat observations. The conclusions largely support what is observed for the idealized simulation. In addition, repeat observations show an underestimation of the errors in the high-S/N regime. We have demonstrated that this trend can be entirely explained by small astrometric errors in individual exposures, which are consistent with the uncertainties derived by the MaNGA astrometry registration routine. In light of this, we leave it up to the user to consider whether adding this extra error contribution is advisable for their specific science goals.

4. We tested how well the hierarchically clustered MILES library (MILES-HC), used in DR15, can be used to fit very young stellar populations (taken from the BC03 SSP library). When the fit includes polynomials, MILES-HC can reproduce the correct spectral shape and most of the Balmer absorption lines for ages older than 25 Myr. Helium absorption lines and Balmer lines in a 5 Myr old population are more difficult to reproduce, even with polynomials.


## 5.

We have studied how the emission-line fluxes may differ if the continuum is fit with a set of different SSP template libraries (M11-MILES, BC03 and MIUSCAT). We find large discrepancies in the recovered fluxes (> 0.1 dex) for S/N < 10. Metal lines are less affected; however, [N II] seems to be affected in a coherent fashion with nearby Hα. These differences in flux can cause larger discrepancies in derived line ratios, extinction correction and metallicity-sensitive indicators. We find discrepancies of 0.1 dex for the O3N2 and R23 metallicity-sensitive indices even for EW(Hα) > 6 Å, where flux from H regions generally dominates over diffuse ionized gas and LIER emission. The choice of template library appears therefore to be the largest source of systematic error studied in this paper.

6. By generating mock cubes with a particular template library and using an alternative library to fit them, we demonstrate that the derived emission-line errors remain statistically correct even in presence of template mismatch.

7. There is no evidence pointing towards inaccuracies in the MaNGA flux calibration in the MILES wavelength range, although there is a hint of a red upturn for λ > 9000, which we have not investigated further since this wavelength range is not fit in DR15. The small deviations (< 10%) from the smooth curves expected for a physical extinction model present in the DR15 polynomials are probably due to inaccuracies in the MILES library flux calibration.

8. Simultaneously fitting the continuum and emission lines, as done in the DAP, has a minor effect on the Balmer line fluxes (<2 %) and no measurable effect on metal lines. The use of additive, rather that multiplicative polynomials, leads to discrepancies in others areas of the spectrum, but still at the few percent level. 9. We have investigated different tying strategies and compared them with the approach followed in DR15, in which all lines were fit with a common velocity and independent velocity dispersions. The MaNGA data used in this work is publicly available at http://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/manga-data/.


## APPENDIX A. COMPARISON WITH PIPE3D

We have shown that the extraction of emission-line fluxes by the DAP is statistically robust between repeat observations, and that the estimated errors on the flux are well-determined down to S/N = 1.5. However, as we have shown in Sections 3 and 4, there may exist systematics in the recovered fluxes of lines based on the choices of continuum model used and other aspects of the fitting methodology. To explore the potential differences that may exist between different fitting routines, we compare some of the derived emission-line properties between the DAP and Pipe3D (Sánchez et al. 2016). The philosophy behind the fitting of the emission lines differs markedly between the DAP and Pipe3D: While the DAP fits the emission lines with positive Gaussian templates simultaneously with the stellar continuum, Pipe3D only fits Gaussians to the strong emission lines. The strong lines are collected into four groups based on their wavelengths, and the velocities of these lines within these groups are kinematically tied. These groups are (i)   for 3 · 10 6 spaxels from 4565 data cubes between Pipe3D and the DAP. These spaxels were selected such that in each spaxel considered, we have a valid and unmasked measurement of the flux in each of the strong lines mentioned above, and an estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion. Pipe3D corrects the emission line for foreground extinction using a Cardelli et al. (1989), with R(V) = 3.1. To ensure an accurate comparison we have adjusted the Pipe3D fluxes to be consistent with an O'Donnell (1994) Milky Way extinction correction, with R(V) = 3.1, as is applied by the DAP.

We compare the ratio of the fluxes from each suite of software as a function of the emission-line equivalent-width (EW) in Figure 21. At high EW, the medians of the line fluxes agree to within 0.02 dex, or ∼ 5%, though for such strong lines, a Gaussian function may not be an accurate approximation to the emission-line profiles, and we might expect systematics to exist. For faint lines, with EW < 10 , we note that the DAP consistently estimates emission lines to be brighter than the Pipe3D estimate. For Hα the median of this effect is of order 10% for lines with EW < 3 , and as much as 25% for [N II]λ6584. Of the lines tested, the only difference is for Hβ, where the DAP reports lower average fluxes compared to Pipe3D at low EW. For the Balmer lines, this may be related to the differences in the stellar-absorption-line fits between the two pipelines; however, this explanation seems less likely for the forbidden lines. We note that for weak lines, the DAP stipulation that emission-line fluxes must be positive will introduce a positive bias, which may partially explain the upward skew seen in the distributions for low EW lines in Figure 21.

While the line-flux measurements are close, the small systematic offsets can be enhanced when we examine some commonly used line ratios, including [N II]/Hα, [O III]/Hβ, and Hα/Hβ. We explore the magnitude of this effect in Figure 22. For the Hα/Hβ and [O III]/Hβ, the ratios are in good agreement between the DAP and Pipe3D when the EW of the appropriate Balmer line is above ∼5 Å. However, for [N II]/Hα, the line ratios are systematically different by ∼ 0.02 dex, even at high EW. Given the good agreement between the Hα fluxes at high EW seen in Figure 21, the offset in [N II]/Hα must be driven by systematic differences in the flux of the [N II] line.

There exist two main differences between the methodologies of Pipe3D and the DAP that might influence the fluxes of the emission lines. These two pipelines use different templates libraries to fit the stellar continua. This difference can result in differences in line fluxes, particularly at low EW. Since the [N II]λ6584 line is adjacent to Hα, the features in the wings of the absorption line can impact the measured flux of the [N II]λ6584 line, particularly in spectra with high stellar velocity dispersion. This is explored in Figure 23. In the left-hand panel we display the average log-ratio between the [N II]λ6584 fluxes (DAP/Pipe3D) as a function of EW and stellar velocity dispersion (σ * ). The differences are most pronounced at low line EW, though we also note that above log(σ * /km s −1 ) 2.25 the discrepancy in the [N II]λ6584 fluxes is enhanced, even for EW>10 Å. The reasons for this behavior are explored in the right-hand panel of Figure 23, where we show four example spectra and the stellar-continuum fits performed by the DAP and Pipe3D. These spectra were chosen to cover a range of [N II] EW and σ * values.

In these examples we can see that differences in the adopted continuum model can have an impact on the flux in the emission lines, even in the spectral region around the forbidden lines. For the highest stellar velocity dispersions, the Hα absorption can spread underneath the [N II] lines, leading to an overestimate of the [N II] flux.

This comparison highlights the difficulties in measuring the strengths of emission lines in galaxy spectra. Systematic differences in the derived fluxes for strong, high-EW lines are within a few per-cent for the majority of the lines examined here. However, caution must be taken not to over-interpret fluxes and flux ratios of emission lines, particularly in the regime of low line EW.

The top spectrum belongs to the central regions of a star-forming galaxy with very bright emission lines (8256-9102), while the bottom spectrum is taken from the central regions of an early-type galaxy with low-EW line emission (8728-12703). Zoomed views are provided for the wavelength regions around [O II]λλ3727,29 and the 4000 Åbreak, Hβ and [O III]λ5007 and Hα and [N II]λλ 6548,84. The figures show the data in black, the results of the first fit (optimized for the determination of stellar kinematics) in blue and the second fit (optimized for emission-line parameters) in red. During the first fit the spectrum is masked around the expected positions of the main emission lines. The region redder than ∼ 7400 Å is not fitted in DR15 because of the limited wavelength coverage of the MILES-HC templates.

The hierarchically clustered MILES templates (MILES-HC) -As discussed in Section 5 ofWestfall et al. (2019), we have applied a hierarchical clustering algorithm to the MILES stellar library spectra, which consists of 985 stars covering the wavelength range 3525 -7500 Å(Sanchez-Blazquez et al. 2006;  Falcón-Barroso et al. 2011). The clustering algorithm subdivides the stars in the MILES library into a number of groups that are defined to be maximally different from each other.


Vazdekis MIUSCAT SSP models (MIUSCAT) -This is a set of 72 SSP models generated according to Vazdekis et al. (2012)11 with a Salpeter IMF (unimodal IMF with slope=1.10.0000, 12.5893 Gyr) and 3 metallicities ([M/H] = -0.4, 0.0, 0.22). MIUSCAT extends the wavelength range of MILES to cover the full range 3465 -9469 Å making use of the near-IR CaT library of

## Figure 7 .
7The fractional RMS (fMRS) of the residuals obtained when fitting the BC03 SSP models of different ages (and solar metallicity) with MILES-HC stellar templates. The residuals are computed in 40 Å bins spanning 3650 -7400 Å. An increase in fRMS is seen at the blue end of the spectrum for young ages (<100 Myr), and also at the position of metal absorption lines 4000 Å < λ < 5000 Å for old ages (> 1 Gyr). An increase in fRMS is also evident at the positions of Hα and Hβ, especially at young ages. The addition of polynomials improves causes a general improvement in the fit quality.

## Figure 8 .
8Zoom-in around the Hydrogen Balmer (left) and Helium (right) lines. The black spectrum corresponds to the input SSP (from BC03) being fit using the MILES-HC library and the colored lines represent the best fits (blue: with no polynomials, green: with 8 th -order additive polynomials, red: with 8 th -order multiplicative polynomials). SSPs of two different ages (5 and 25 Myr) are shown.

## Figure 9 .
9The ratio in the emission-line flux (in dex) obtained when modeling the continuum with various SSP templates (MIUSCAT: red, M11-MILES: blue, BC03: green) with respect to the fluxes obtained in DR15 (which uses MILES-HC templates) as a function of line S/N. The dashed gray lines correspond to the level where the flux discrepancy is equal to the random error. The largest systematic discrepancies are found for Balmer lines at low S/N. Low-S/N line emission in MaNGA is generally associated with low-EW line emission, so this figure looks equivalent with the flux discrepancy plotted as a function of EW instead of S/N.

## Figure 10 .
10Continuum fits around the Hα and [N II]λλ6548,84 for the central spaxels of four example galaxies spanning different regions of the NUV −r versus log(M /M ) plane using different stellar (MILES-HC) and SSP (M11-MILES, MIUSCAT, BC03) templates. It should be noted how MIUSCAT and M11-MILES prefer deeper Balmer absorption-line cores and how BC03 displays significantly different line wings, which affect the continuum under the [N II]λλ6548,84 doublet. The galaxies in figure are: low-mass blue: 7815-6101; massive blue: 8138-12704; low-mass red: 8329-1901; massive red: 8258-6102.

## Figure 11 .
11The difference in dex between specific line ratios when the spectral fitting is preformed with various SSP templates (MIUSCAT: red, M11-MILES: blue, BC03: green) with respect to the line ratios obtained in DR15 (which uses MILES-HC templates) as a function of line EW. E(B − V) is computed from the Balmer decrement assuming and intrinsic ratio Hα/Hβ = 2.86 and a Calzetti (2001) extinction curve. In the case of E(B − V) the plotted difference is in magnitudes. The R23 index is computed after correcting for dust attenuation, while the other indices are not corrected.

## Figure 12 .Figure 13 .
1213The difference between the input and output fluxes, normalized to the error, for a parameter-recovery simulation that includes template mismatch (see text). The setup of the figure is the same asFigure 5a. The solid colored lines represent the median and the dashed colored lines the 16th and 84th percentiles of the normalized residual distributions for the different strong lines considered. The Balmer lines (Hα in black and Hβ in blue) display the expected systematic offset at high S/N. The median multiplicative polynomial correction applied to the best-fit continuum templates calculated for all spaxels in a sample of 100 random galaxies from DR15. Red and blue solid lines correspond to the median correction for log(M /M ) > 10 and log(M /M ) < 10 galaxies, respectively. The shaded regions correspond to the 16th and 84th percentiles. The black curves represent a Calzetti (2001) extinction curve with different values of E(B − V).

## Figure 17 .
17The figure demonstrates that in DR15 the velocity dispersion of different emission lines within the MILES wavelength range are in good agreement with each other, with no large wavelength-dependent systematic. The largest discrepancies are found in the blue end of the wavelength range, where both [O II] and Hδ are larger than Hα by 0.07 dex (∼17%) on average. The median of the ratio of emission-line fluxes (in dex) obtained between different test runs and DR15 as a function of S/N. Different test runs implement different strategies for tying velocities and velocity dispersions of the various emission lines (see

## Figure 20 .
20The ratio (in dex) between the intrinsic velocity dispersion of different emission lines with respect to Hα in DR15 as a function of wavelength. The intrinsic (astrophysical) dispersion is measured by subtracting, in quadrature, our estimate of the instrumental velocity dispersion from the measured line velocity dispersion. Balmer lines are represented in black and metal lines in blue. Only spaxels with S/N > 10 in the specific emission line are considered to generate the plot. The error bars represent the 1-σ scatter.

For the weaker emission lines, Pipe3D performs a moment-based analysis to numerically integrate the weak emission lines, and uses a Monte Carlo method to estimate the errors. This fitting algorithm can return a negative value in noise-dominated spectra. Moreover, where the DAP fits the stellar component of the spectrum using the MILES-HC library, Pipe3D B.

## Figure 21 .
21The ratio of emission-line flux as measured by the DAP to the flux measured by Pipe3D as a function of the emission-line equivalentwidth (EW). We show only data for which the DAP S/N > 3. The solid lines represent the median of the distribution, while the dashed lines represent the 16th and 84th percentiles of the distributions. The black dotted lines are the median errors on the flux ratio at a given line EW. models the stellar light with a set of of 156 simple-stellar-population models which the authors refer to as the GSD156 library (Cid Fernandes et al. 2013). This library includes the Granada models of González Delgado et al. (2005) for stellar populations younger than 63 Myr and the Vazdekis et al. (2010) models for older stellar populations. The GSD156 library thus represents a grid in age and metallicity, with ages ranging from 1 Myr to 14.1 Gyr, and covering four values of metallicity (Z/Z =0.2, 0.4, 1.0 and 1.5). Below we compare some of the derived emission-line products for a selection of commonly used strong lines. We compare the fluxes for O IIλλ3727, 3729, Hβ, [O III]λ5007, Hα, [N II]λ6584, and [S II]λ6731

## Figure 22 .
22The difference in emission-line ratios as measured by the DAP to the flux measured by Pipe3D as a function of the emission-line EW of the included Balmer line. We show only data for which the DAP yields S/N > 3. The solid lines are the median difference as a function of Balmer-line EW, and the dashed lines are the 16th and 84th percentiles of the distribution. Black dotted lines are the median errors on the difference between the ratios. While skewed upwards at low Hβ, the distributions of Hα/Hβ and [O III]/Hβ are consistent within the measurement uncertainties. This is not true for [N II]/Hα, for which the DAP has measured a higher value, even at high Hα EW.

## Figure 23 .
23In this figure we explore the reasons for the discrepancies in the [N II] fluxes between the DAP and Pipe3D. On the left, the color of each pixel in the map represents the mean log([N II] DAP /[N II] Pipe3D ) as a function of the stellar velocity dispersion in the corresponding spectrum (σ * ) and the [N II] EW. The largest discrepancies exist at low EW and high σ * . On the right, we show the fits to the spectrum (in blue) around the [N II]/Hα region. In red, we show the DAP stellar-continuum fit, and in green we show the Pipe3D continuum fit. Systematic differences in the absorption line profile can extend underneath the [N II] emission line. This may explain the systematic differences in the [N II] fluxes between pipelines.

.1Wavelengths and ionization potential of the relevant ion for each emission line fit for DR15, subdivided in the groups defined to study the different tying schemes described in Section 5.3. Ritz wavelengths in vacuum are taken from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST; http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/Html/help.html). The DAP string name is reported in the header of the MAPS files for the emission-line extensions and allows the users to associate each map with the correct line (see Section 6.1). Ionization potentials are taken fromDraine (2011). Lines redder than ∼ 7400 Å corresponding to the red cutoff of the MILES-HC stellar templates, are not fit in DR15.The 22 emission lines fit by the DAP in DR15 is presented inTable 1.

The code 15 http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html 16 http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~ott/QFitsView/ example below provides an example of how to obtain the Hα flux map from the DAP MAPS file and encode it into a numpy masked array.import numpy as np

## 1 .
1The [O II]λλ3727,29 velocity-dispersion masks and errors are incorrect in DR15. In particular, the vast majority of spaxels in the velocity-dispersion maps of [O II] are masked in DR15 because of a bug. The maps of the velocity dispersions themselves are, however, correct. We therefore recommend to ignore the mask extensions for the [O II]λλ3727,29 line velocity dispersions and apply the Hα velocity dispersion masks instead. Unfortunately the same bug caused the inverse variance extensions for the [O II] lines to be filled with zeros. This has been fixed for future releases, but for DR15 uncertainties for the [O II] velocity dispersions are not available.


Large differences (> 0.1 dex) are found comparing DR15 and the case where all kinematic components are left free, but only for S/N < 2. Treating all velocities independently, tying velocities of all the lines, or groups of lines with similar ionization potential does not lead to any systematic changes in the best-fit velocity. Considering the DR15 determination of the instrumental dispersion at the position of different emission lines, velocity dispersions of different lines agree with Hα on average to better than 0.07 dex across the full MILES wavelength range.The data products generated by the MaNGA DAP are made publicly available at http://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/, while the DAP source code can be accessed via GitHub at https://github.com/sdss/mangadap.
