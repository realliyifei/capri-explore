Near-infrared H-and K-band spectra are presented for 247 objects, selected from the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey as potential young stellar objects (YSOs). 195 (∼ 80%) of the targets are YSOs, of which 131 are massive YSOs (L BOL > 5 × 10 3 L ⊙ , M > 8 M ⊙ ). This is the largest spectroscopic study of massive YSOs to date, providing a valuable resource for the study of massive star formation. In this paper we present our exploratory analysis of the data. The YSOs observed have a wide range of embeddedness (2.7 < A V < 114), demonstrating that this study covers minimally obscured objects right through to very red, dusty sources. Almost all YSOs show some evidence for emission lines, though there is a wide variety of observed properties. The most commonly detected lines are Br γ, H 2 , fluorescent Fe II, CO bandhead, [Fe II] and He I 2-1 1 S-1 P, in order of frequency of occurrence. In total, ∼ 40% of the YSOs display either fluorescent Fe II 1.6878 µm or CO bandhead emission (or both), indicative of a circumstellar disc; however, no correlation of the strength of these lines with bolometric luminosity was found. We also find that ∼ 60% of the sources exhibit [Fe II] or H 2 emission, indicating the presence of an outflow. Three quarters of all sources have Br γ in emission. A good correlation with bolometric luminosity was observed for both the Br γ and H 2 emission line strengths, covering 1 L ⊙ < L BOL < 3.5 × 10 5 L ⊙ . This suggests that the emission mechanism for these lines is the same for low-, intermediate-, and high-mass YSOs, i.e. high-mass YSOs appear to resemble scaled-up versions of low-mass YSOs.

# INTRODUCTION

Massive stars (> 8 M⊙, i.e. > 5 × 10 3 L⊙) have a profound influence on their surroundings due to their intense ionizing radiation, strong stellar winds and powerful outflows. However, despite the fact that low-mass star formation is broadly understood (Shu, Adams & Lizano 1987), relatively little is known about the conditions and processes that influence high-mass star formation. The study of massive star formation is hindered by the rarity of massive stars, their short evolutionary time-scales, and the dust extinction which renders the stars invisible at short wavelengths for most of their formation.

The massive young stellar object (MYSO) phase is of particular interest for the study of massive star formation. In this relatively brief phase (10 4−5 years: Davies et al. 2011; Mottram et al. 2011a), fusion has begun in the central star, but it has not yet ionized its surroundings to form an H II region. Accretion may be disrupted or completely halted, in which case the final mass of the star would be set in this phase. MYSOs typically have strong, ionized stellar winds (Bunn, Hoare & Drew 1995) and bipolar molecular outflows (Shepherd & Churchwell 1996), both of which have an important feedback effect on the surrounding molecular cloud.

Whilst these properties mean that the MYSO stage is crucial to the understanding of massive star formation, their observation is not without difficulties. Dust extinction hinders optical and IR studies, their lack of H II regions means that radio emission is either weak or non-existent, and although MYSOs are often associated with masers, no single maser transition can be guaranteed to be present .

Most of the bolometric luminosity of MYSOs is found in the thermal IR, so that is where they are most easily observed. Previous attempts to produce a large sample of MYSOs have been made using IRAS (e.g. Molinari et al. 1996;Sridharan et al. 2002). The low spatial resolution of IRAS (3 ′ × 5 ′ at 100 µm) meant that in star clusters and in the dense environment of the Galactic Plane sources were often confused. Since most massive stars form in clusters and exist within the Galactic Plane, the MYSOs in these studies may not be representative of all massive stars. The small number of MYSOs that have been identified so far means that there is a lack of statistical evidence with which to improve our understanding of high-mass star formation.

The Red MSX-Source Survey (RMS; Hoare et al. 2005;Urquhart et al. 2008a) is a valuable tool with which to address these issues, having taken both imaging and spectroscopic data from near-IR to radio wavelengths on a comprehensive, uniformly selected sample of MYSOs. The MSX point source catalogue (Egan et al. 2003) and near-IR 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006) data were used to find sources with IR excess. The MSX survey has a much better spatial resolution than IRAS, thus eliminating the bias against dense environments (Hoare et al. 2004). The reddest, most embedded objects were selected as targets using colour cuts defined by Lumsden et al. (2002). However, ultra-compact H II (UCHII) regions, planetary nebulae (PN) and dusty evolved stars also have similar colours to MYSOs, so classification of the sources has been a major part of the project. A campaign of follow-up observations has been undertaken to achieve this (see Urquhart et al. 2008a). We combined radio, mid-IR, and near-IR images with kinematic distances and far-IR data to characterise our sources (Mottram et al. 2007;Urquhart et al. 2007aUrquhart et al. ,b, 2008bUrquhart et al. , 2009aMottram et al. 2010Mottram et al. , 2011aUrquhart et al. 2011aUrquhart et al. ,b, 2012. The full classification criteria are discussed in Lumsden et al. (in preparation).

Near-IR spectroscopy is the final classification stage, separating the MYSOs from the remaining sources. To date, ∼ 90% of the ∼ 2000 objects from the original survey have been classified, identifying ∼ 600 MYSOs and ∼ 500 UCHII regions. 1 In total, we have spectroscopic observations of ∼ 450 objects. The data for the ∼ 200 objects observed in the Southern Hemisphere are still in the analysis process, and will be presented in a future paper. In this paper we present near-IR spectra and classifications of 247 objects observed in the Northern Hemisphere, i.e. ∼ 12% of the objects in the survey.


# OBSERVATIONS

Spectroscopic observations of the young stellar object candidates were made using the UIST instrument at the United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT) observatory from 2002 to 2008. 247 objects were successfully observed over 84 nights. Sources were selected from the ∼ 2000 candidate MYSOs found using the MSX catalogue in the preceding stages of the RMS survey. Initially, no radio or luminosity data were available, so the criteria for the spectroscopic observations were that the objects satisfy the colour cuts laid out in Lumsden et al. (2002), and that they were bright enough to be seen at the K-band in 2MASS to enable correct identification of the counterpart. Once luminosity estimates were available, a loose luminosity cut of L21µm 500 L⊙ (which corresponds to LBOL 10000 L⊙, see Mottram et al. 2011a) was imposed. Therefore fewer low-luminosity sources were observed in the later runs. We targeted our source selection to observe all objects we believed to be YSOs with the appropriate luminosity, plus the 10% of the ∼ 2000 candidates whose classifications were ambiguous. A full list of observational parameters for each individual object is shown in Tables A1 and A2 (see Appendix A).

UIST is a 1-5 µm imager-spectrometer with a 1024×1024 InSb array and a camera with 0.12 ′′ /pixel resolution in spectroscopy mode. The HK grism (1.395-2.506 µm) was used, with a 0.48 ′′ ×120 ′′ long slit. This produces a fairly low spectral resolution of λ/∆λ ∼500, but meant that in ideal conditions a high signal-noise ratio could be achieved with relatively short exposure time. This allowed identification of faint lines whilst maximising the number of objects that could be observed in the time awarded. In practise a large number of the observations were done in poor weather conditions and with typical seeing of 1 ′′ , so the signal-noise ratio was not always very high, and flux calibration was unreliable on some nights. Exposure times for each object are shown in Table A1.

Many of the observations were taken before the near-IR counterparts had been accurately identified. As a result, finding charts were frequently done at the telescope using UIST in imaging mode so that the counterpart could be identified prior to taking the spectrum. In a few instances, such spectra were repeated later if subsequent high spatial resolution thermal IR images suggested a different source was the correct counterpart. The position angle for the slit (also shown in Table A1) was derived from such images, as well as from 2MASS images for brighter, isolated sources, or GLIMPSE 2 for complex embedded sources. The aim was to avoid very bright, unrelated stars nearby, and if possible to align the slit on other interesting objects and extended emission nearby. This proved a useful technique as several fields of view had more than one MYSO within the field, and many have extended emission. In the tables, multiple objects within the same field of view are denoted by G*** -1 and G*** -2 etc.

Standard stars with spectral types ranging from A0 -B9.5 were observed before each object for flux calibration, and the objects were nodded along the slit to minimise the effect of bad pixels and aid sky subtraction. The spectrum of an argon lamp was taken each night for wavelength calibration.

The standard star and object spectra were all reduced using the UKIRT pipeline Orac-Dr and the Starlink package Figaro. To prevent confusion between emission lines in the object spectra and the H I absorption lines in the Akritas-Theil-Sen Line Figure 1. Measured vs. catalogue magnitudes for both H-and K-bands. The catalogue magnitudes were taken from either UKIDSS or 2MASS depending on the object and the quality of the catalogue data. Detections are denoted by black diamonds and limits by green arrows. The dotted lines represent the ATS regressions. As expected, a strong correlation was found between the measured and catalogue magnitudes (see text for more details). standard star spectra, the lines in the standards were fitted with Gaussian functions and removed before flux calibrating the object spectra. Flux calibration was done using the Figaro routine irflux. This routine uses a black-body model for the standard star, normalised to the star's flux at K. The K-band magnitudes and spectral types of the standard stars were taken from the SIMBAD data base. The temperatures corresponding to the spectral types were taken from Schmidt-Kaler (1982).


# PHOTOMETRY

We compared our magnitude data with the 2MASS Point Source Catalogue (2MASS PSC; Skrutskie et al. 2006) and UKIDSS GPS data base release 8. 3 The choice of catalogue used for analysis was decided on an object-by-object basis. Some objects are listed in both catalogues, others in only one, and some do not have any near-IR magnitude data available. Where available, UKIDSS GPS magnitudes were preferred due to their improved sensitivity and resolution. However, due to its incomplete status, not all the objects we observed were covered by UKIDSS, and those that were do not always have data for all of J-, H-and K-bands. In addition, the UKIDSS camera, WFCAM (Casali et al. 2007) tends to saturate for the brighter objects. For objects with incomplete, low quality, or saturated WFCAM data 2MASS was used. Overall, for our 247 sources, 125 were compared 3 The UKIDSS project is defined in Lawrence et al. (2007). UKIDSS uses the UKIRT Wide Field Camera (WFCAM; Casali et al. 2007) and a photometric system described in Hewett et al. (2006). The pipeline processing and science archive are described in Irwin (2008) and Hambly et al. (2008).

to 2MASS photometry, 108 to UKIDSS, and 14 had no magnitude data available in either catalogue. The data for each object are found in Table A2.

The magnitudes were also measured from the spectra using the Figaro function istat, which gives the mean and total flux and the r.m.s. (σ) across a user-defined wavelength range. The ranges used to measure the total flux were 1.5365-1.7875 µm and 2.028-2.290 µm for H and K respectively. These correspond to the wavelength ranges for the 2MASS magnitude measurements, as described in Cohen et al. (2003). UKIDSS magnitudes are calibrated to 2MASS (Hodgkin et al. 2009), so the same ranges were used to measure the spectral magnitude regardless of which catalogue magnitudes were used for comparison. The continuum noise (σ) was measured using 0.01 µm ranges around 1.6 µm and 2.2 µm for H and K respectively. These ranges are clear of emission lines and of distortion from atmospheric features, both of which can cause an over-estimation of σ. The fluxes were then converted into magnitudes, using the H and K zero-points 1.133 × 10 −9 and 4.283 × 10 −10 Wm −2 µm −1 for 2MASS sources (Cohen et al. 2003), and 1.131 × 10 −9 and 4.271 × 10 −10 Wm −2 µm −1 for UKIDSS sources (Hodgkin et al. 2009). The errors on the magnitudes given in Table A2 are 3σ errors. Some of the sources were not detected at H, in which case their H-band magnitudes could not be calculated. However, most spectra were bright enough at H that their magnitudes could be measured, and all were bright enough at K. Figure 1 shows a comparison of catalogue with measured magnitudes, for both H-and K-bands. The dotted lines represent Akritas-Thiel-Sen (ATS) regressions. The ATS regression and Kendall's τ were calculated using the cenken (Akritas, Murphy, & LaValley 1995) function in the NADA library (Helsel 2005)  statistics package, and compared with other regression methods and correlation tests performed using the Asurv statistics package (Isobe et al. 1986;Isobe & Feigelson 1990;Lavalley et al. 1992). These statistical methods were used to take account of the many censored data present (see also Section 6.5). Based on a y = a + bx fit, the ATS fit coefficients for H are aH = 0.96 and bH = 0.92. For K, the coefficients are aK = −0.08 and bK = 1.02. The Kendall's τ values for H and K are 0.48 and 0.70 respectively, both with p-values ≃ 0; i.e. there is essentially no possibility that a correlation does not exist.

The lower τ and greater deviation in the fit from m obs = mcat for H-band magnitudes is primarily due to the fact that many of the fainter objects have very noisy H-band spectra, and some were not detected at shorter wavelengths. This means that there are more limits, and the errors at the high end of the magnitude range are larger, both of which decrease the measured correlation coefficient and pull the regression line away from m obs = mcat. Nevertheless, the correlation is clearly there for both H-and K-bands, and the regression coefficients for the K-band are very close to m obs = mcat. This shows that, for most objects, the pho-  Figure 3. Example spectra of the MYSOs.

This figure shows all the major emission lines seen in MYSOs, but is not intended to be representative in terms of the proportion of MYSOs that show each emission line.

tometry measured from the spectra is good despite the frequently poor weather conditions.

Those objects that deviate strongly from the m obs = mcat were all taken in very poor weather conditions and/or with poor seeing. The conditions were highly time-variable for these badly affected observations. The much longer exposure times for the objects average out such variations whereas the shorter exposure times for the standards do not. The raw standard star data counts were noticeably very low for these observations in particular. The ratio of object to standard then becomes exaggerated. Since there is only one standard star spectrum per object, there was no way to mitigate against this. For consistency, all the fluxes were normalised to the catalogue magnitudes. The correction factor, f obs /fcorr = 10 (m obs −mcat )/−2.5 , was calculated using the standard equation for apparent magnitude, and is shown in Table A3.


# CLASSIFICATION

The objects were primarily classified using the RMS followup observations. These criteria are described in detail in Lumsden et al. (in preparation). In summary, MYSOs conform to the colour cuts defined in Lumsden et al. (2002), are radio-quiet due to insufficient ionized gas, show strong millimetre CO emission as expected in a star formation region, and appear as point sources in mid-IR images at 1 ′′ resolution. They show clustering in near-IR images in con-trast to more evolved stars, which appear as isolated point sources. This left a sample of predominantly MYSOs, but also of some H II regions, proto-planetary nebulae, compact planetary nebulae and embedded evolved stars. Near-IR spectroscopy was necessary to distinguish between the MYSOs and contaminants. The spectra were classified according to the shape of their continuum and the presence or absence of emission and/or absorption features. All the spectra show telluric water absorption in the 1.8 − 2.0 µm range. Consequently, this range could not be used in the analysis and was taken out of the figures. Example spectra of the contaminants are shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows example spectra of MYSOs. Each major emission line is present in at least one of the MYSO spectra shown in the example figures. Spectra of all objects observed will be available on the RMS data base. 4 MYSOs are still embedded in their natal clouds, so their spectra show strong dust extinction in the form of a steep rising continuum, and occasionally excess dust emission at λ 2.3 µm. Almost all have emission lines, the most common being Br γ and H2. Some also have H-band Brackett series, shocked [Fe II], fluorescent Fe II, or CO bandhead emission. Both Br γ and He I can be seen in emission, absorption, or with a P-Cygni-type profile, though at this low resolution it was not possible to obtain expansion velocities for such profiles.

Massive YSOs were differentiated from low-mass YSOs by their luminosity: a loose cut of L > 10 3 L⊙ was applied. Most of the RMS YSOs have luminosities characteristic of massive stars: 131/195 (∼ 70%) of the RMS YSOs in this paper have L > 5 × 10 3 L⊙, which corresponds to M > 8 M⊙ (Mottram et al. 2011b). However, their spectral properties are very different from those of typical main sequence stars (Hanson et al. 2005).

H II regions have comparatively flat continua, strong H I emission, and, often, He I emission. The H I emission conforms to case-B of Baker & Menzel (1938) since it originates in an optically thin ionized region. It is worth noting that it was occasionally difficult to distinguish between MYSOs with strong H I emission and H II regions by their spectra alone. Generally, this was achieved using other data from the RMS Survey follow-up or in the literature. In particular, radio observations and GLIMPSE images were used. In most cases, H II regions produce free-free radio emission owing to the large amount of ionized gas, whereas H I emission in MYSOs does not produce bright free-free emission. In addition, H II regions appear diffuse in mid-IR GLIMPSE images, so even radio-quiet 'weak' H II regions can usually be distinguished from MYSOs. Sometimes the suspected central star of an H II region has characteristics of a YSO. These were classified as 'YSO/HIIR'.

Evolved stars have much less dust extinction and therefore have comparatively blue continua, or continua that peak in the middle of the 1.5-2.5 µm range. They occasionally have the Brackett series in emission or absorption, and frequently have CO bandhead absorption. Proto-planetary nebulae (PPN) are very red and can have strong CO absorption. Some of the PPN spectra closely resemble those of FU-Ori type objects, so it is possible that some of the objects we have classified as PPN are in fact FU-Ori type objects. The spectra of planetary nebulae (PN) are flat or red and are often very similar to YSO or H II region spectra. In these cases, other data from the RMS Survey follow-up and the literature were used to classify the object. The final class found within our sample were M-Giants. These have continua that peak in the middle of the 1.5-2.5 µm region, show molecular absorption lines owing to their cool atmospheres, and have strong H2O absorption.

Of the 247 objects whose spectra were taken, there were 180 YSOs, 15 YSOs within H II regions, 26 H II regions, 7 evolved stars, 5 PPN, 4 PN, 5 M-type supergiants, and 5 evolved hot stars labelled as 'Other' in the table and on the RMS data base website due to unusual characteristics in their data. Spectra were found to be a valuable confirmation of classification in addition to our imaging data in 45% of cases, and the only means of classifying the source in 5% of cases.


# EXTINCTION

Two estimates of extinction to each object were calculated, using the Draine & Lee (1984) / Draine (1989) interstellar extinction model; one using J − H colours and the other using H − K colours. The MYSO colours were normalised to the intrinsic colours of a B0 star, taken from Koornneef (1983): J − H = −0.12 and H − K = −0.05. For these calculations, the catalogue magnitudes in Table A2 were used. The results are listed in Table A3 as 'AV (JH)' and 'AV (HK)' for calculations using the J − H and H − K colours respectively. The equation for AV is:
AV = m1 − m2 + cint 0.55 1.75 (λ −1.75 1 − λ −1.75 2 )
(1)

where m1 and m2 are the magnitudes used to calculate the extinction (either J-and H-band magnitudes, or H-and K-band magnitudes), λ1 and λ2 are their reference wavelengths, cint is the intrinsic m1 −m2 from Koornneef (1983), and 1.75 is the Draine & Lee (1984) / Draine (1989 reddening constant. The errors were calculated in quadrature as follows:
δAV = δm 2 1 + δm 2 2 0.55 1.75 (λ −1.75 1 − λ −1.75 2 )(2)
These are shown in Table A3. Where one or more magnitudes are unavailable, the extinctions cannot be calculated, and '-' is marked in the table. Where the 2MASS magnitude is a lower-limit, the AV given is also a lower-limit. For 35 sources (27 of them YSOs), there was not enough magnitude data to calculate an extinction. The left panel of Figure 4 shows AV (HK) against AV (JH) for the YSOs. The solid line represents AV (HK) = AV (JH), and the dotted line is the ATS regression line. The Kendall's τ is 0.36, with a p-value of 3.0 × 10 −11 , indicating a good correlation between the two. The equation for the fit is AV (HK) = 6.0 + 1.1AV (JH)

The regression line falls above the AV (HK) = AV (JH) line. This was explained by Porter et al. (1998): the H−K colours appear redder in young objects due to dust excess, and the J − H colours appear bluer due to scattering at short wavelengths. This artificially increases AV (HK) and decreases AV (JH), meaning the true value for extinction lies somewhere between the two. As the amount of dust increases, the effect becomes more pronounced and the regression line deviates further from the AV (HK) = AV (JH) line. Figure 5 shows a colour-colour diagram demonstrating this point. Some of the objects do fall very close to the extinction line, i.e. the line that runs parallel to the extinction vector and starts at the intrinsic J − H and H − K colours. However, most fall above this line, showing evidence of the dust excess emission and/or scattering described above.

For extinction correction, AV (HK) was used where available, or AV (JH) when AV (HK) was not available, or was a lower limit. The number distribution of these extinctions is shown in the right panel of Figure 4. The median is AV = 42, and the extinctions range from AV = 2.7 to AV = 114, demonstrating that this study covers the minimally obscured objects right through to very red, dusty sources.


# YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS


## Spectral Features

In addition to the strong dust extinction and corresponding steep rising continuum, most YSOs have emission lines in their spectra. However, not all of them show the same lines. One of the objectives of the RMS survey is to identify why there are differences. 1.6878 µm, and CO bandhead. Some objects also exhibited the Pfund series, or other molecular H2 lines. He I 2.0587 µm was seen in both emission and absorption. Both Br γ and He I were occasionally seen with P-Cygni-type profiles: 13 MYSOs had Br γ with a P-Cygni profile and 15 had He I with a P-Cygni profile, of which 8 had P-Cygni profiles for both Br γ and He I. These objects are listed in Table B3. However, the He I 2.11 µm doublet was not seen in the YSOs, only in H II regions. Detection frequencies are shown in Table 1.


## Emission and Absorption Line Fluxes

The fluxes of the YSO emission and absorption lines were measured using the Starlink package Dipso. The continuum was fitted by a 3 rd order polynomial function, then subtracted. In many cases, the steepness of the continuum ob-scured the presence of emission lines that became visible when the continuum was subtracted. For all spectral features except the CO 2-0 bandhead, the line profiles were fitted with a Gaussian function, which Dipso then integrated to find the total flux of the line. The majority of the spectral lines are unresolved so a Gaussian function is a good assumption.

Detections were defined as having f λ > 3 δf λ , where f λ is the line flux and δf λ is the error. For the unresolved lines, Dipso gave a good estimation of the error. Where the lines had broad wings or interference in the profile shape from noise, Dipso could still fit the line with a Gaussian, but could not accurately estimate the error. When this was the case, errors were calculated using the equation for a Gaussian with the height equal to the continuum r.m.s. noise, i.e.
δf λ = h W 2 √ 2 ln 2(4)
where h is height, and W is the FWHM of an unresolved peak at that wavelength. The continuum r.m.s. noise was measured using Figaro's istat function, taking wavelength ranges with no spectral lines, close enough to the pertinent spectral line that extinction would not distort the result. The r.m.s. noise was measured for two ranges per line, one either side of the line, and the mean value of these was taken. The upper limits for non-detections were calculated using the same equation, with h = 3 × continuum r.m.s.

The CO bandhead has a saw-tooth shaped profile (see Figure 6), so different treatment was required. The equivalent width (EW) was measured from 2.289-2.313 µm, again using Dipso. The mean continuum flux density was measured across the 2.2825-2.2875 µm range just to the blue end of the bandhead, using Figaro's istat function. The EWs were then converted into fluxes. This is consistent with the method used by Ishii et al. (2001). Detections were again defined as EW > 3 δEW, where δEW is the error given by Dipso. Limits were taken as EW limit = 3 δEW.

The  Calvet et al. (2004) relationship between L ACC and L Brγ . In both plots, all the line luminosities have been corrected for extinction, and the RMS data have been corrected for the difference between measured and catalogue magnitudes.

1.64 µm line, H2 2.1218 µm, H2 2.2477 µm, fluorescent Fe II 1.6878 µm, and He I 2.0587 µm lines are listed in Table B1, with the presence of the Pfund series denoted by 'P' in the final column. The equivalent widths of the CO 2-0 bandhead are listed in Table B2. The errors in the tables are at the 1σ level. The fluxes and equivalent widths in the tables are the raw values as measured directly from the spectra, and are not corrected for extinction or normalised to the catalogue magnitude (see Section 3). Br 12 and [Fe II] 1.64402 µm are close to each other and form a blend when both are present (see Figure 7). To determine whether the line seen at 1.64 µm is Br 12, [Fe II], or a blend, one has to compare this line with the rest of the Brackett series. For this reason, the fluxes of Br 12 and [Fe II] are listed in Table B1 in the same column. Un-blended [Fe II] corresponds to the presence of a line at 1.64 µm when Br 10 and Br 11 are absent. When the rest of the Brackett series is present, the presence of [Fe II] can only be inferred if the relative strength of the 1.64 µm line compared to Br 11 is higher than expected. Assuming Baker & Menzel (1938) case-B recombination with the Storey & Hummer (1995) line ratios for Te = 7500 K and Ne = 10 6 cm −3 , the 1.64 µm line was defined as a blend if f (1.64 µm) > 0.788 × f (Br 11). See Section 6.3 for a full discussion of the properties of H I lines.

This cut relies on the emission lines being optically thin. If the lines are not optically thin, the flux of the Br 12 line may fall above this limit but not have a contribution from [Fe II]. This means that there are probably some objects that are considered to have a blend of Br 12 and [Fe II] under this definition that actually only have Br 12. However, the low resolution of the spectra meant that de-convolving the lines was not possible, so this was considered to be the best available separation method for the purposes of this paper.

In 9 of the YSO spectra, dust extinction rendered part or all of the H-band too noisy to identify emission lines in this region with any confidence. This caused difficulties in the analysis of these spectra. However, given that there are 195 objects classified as YSO or YSO/HIIR, this represents only ∼ 5 % of the objects. Excluding these objects from the H-Band data analysis still leaves a large enough sample to make statistically sound conclusions.


## H I Emission

The detection rate of Br γ emission amongst the YSOs is 75 %, and many of these also have other H I lines. This detection frequency is lower than the 97% found by Ishii et al. (2001) for intermediate-mass YSOs and Herbig Ae/Be stars, but comparable with the 71% found by Carr (1990) for lowmass YSOs. Br γ was also seen with a P-Cygni profile in the spectra of 13 objects (see Table B3), indicating that for those objects, Br γ originated in an outflowing wind.

The left panel of Figure 8 shows a comparison of Br γ luminosity with bolometric luminosity (the latter from Mottram et al. 2011a). Correlation and regression tests were performed on the line vs. bolometric luminosity data for the RMS objects only. The ATS regression is represented in the figure by the dotted line. The equation of the line is:
LBrγ = 10 −4.0 × (LBOL) 0.85(5)
A summary of the results of the correlation tests for all the lines is shown in Table 2. The Kendall's τ coefficient for Br γ vs. LBOL shows that there is a strong correlation between the Br γ luminosity and the bolometric luminosity of the star. This correlation was also seen in studies of lowand intermediate-mass YSOs and Herbig Ae/Be stars (Carr 1990;Ishii et al. 2001;Connelley & Greene 2010). Br γ emission is known to be related to accretion in lowmass stars (Calvet et al. 2004), and has been scaled up to Herbig Ae/Be stars by Garcia-Lopez et al. (2006). The right panel of Figure 8 compares detections in the RMS sources with those of Carr (1990) and Ishii et al. (2001). The solid lines represent the loci of LACC = LBOL, LACC = 0.1 LBOL, and LACC = 0.01 LBOL using the empirical relationship from Calvet et al. (2004): log 10 (LACC) = −0.7 + 0.9 (log 10 (LBrγ) + 4)

The majority of the objects have 0.01 LBOL < LACC < LBOL. This appears to be true for most RMS sources, implying that there is a common mechanism producing Br γ throughout the mass range covered by Carr (1990), Ishii et al. (2001) and the RMS sources. This trend is seen with other emission lines, suggesting that high-mass YSOs resemble scaled-up versions of low-or intermediate-mass YSOs.

One of the considerations when distinguishing MYSOs with Brackett series emission from H II regions is whether the recombination conforms to case-B of Baker & Menzel (1938); recombination emission in typical compact H II regions conforms to case-B, whereas this is not always true for MYSOs. Storey & Hummer (1995) tabulated the case-B line ratios for a range of temperatures and densities.

The temperature of the gas in which the Br series lines originate must lie between that of a UCHII region (Te ∼ 7500 K) at the lower end, to an OB star (Te 30000 K) at the upper end. Similarly, the density of a UCHII region imposes a lower limit on the density of Ne 10 4 cm −3 . A realistic maximum density for the stellar wind would be Ne 10 11 cm −3 . For Te and Ne in this range, the Storey & Hummer (1995) Br 10/Br γ ratio varies from 0.327 to 0.490, i.e. around a 30% variation. Similarly, the Br 12/Br 11 ratio varies from 0.756 to 0.834, i.e. about 10 %.

We adopt the case-B values for MYSOs based on observational evidence (e.g. Porter et al. 1998 Bary et al. (2008); and the black dotted line represents the case in which Br 10 and Br γ are both optically thick (i.e. black-body emission). The line luminosities have been corrected for extinction, and for the difference between measured and catalogue magnitudes. Ne = 10 14 cm −3 when modelling production in infalling magnetospheric gas, whereas Bary et al. (2008) observed Paschen and Brackett series H I recombination line ratios consistent with temperatures Te 2000 K and densities 10 9 < Ne < 10 10 cm −3 , inconsistent with production in accreting material. The Hartigan et al. (1991) and Bary et al. (2008) Te and Ne values correspond to Storey & Hummer (1995) Br 12/Br 11 ratios of 0.757 and 0.764 respectively, which are not vastly different from the 0.788 ratio given by using the observational values for Te and Ne, given a typical flux error for the 1.64 µm line of ∼ 10%. However, while the Br 12/Br 11 ratio is very similar whichever set of Te and Ne values are used, this is not the case for the Br 10/Br γ ratios: The observed Te and Ne and the Hartigan et al. (1991) Te and Ne produce line ratios of 0.338 and 0.301 respectively, whereas the Bary et al. (2008) ratio is 0.597. Figure 9 shows Br 10 luminosity against Br γ luminosity. Shown on the plot are 3 lines: one showing the Storey & Hummer (1995) Br 10/Br γ ratio using observed Te and Ne values for MYSOs; one showing the Br 10/Br γ ratio for T-Tauri stars using Te and Ne from Bary et al. (2008); and finally one showing the theoretical ratio for optically thick emission. The Hartigan et al. (1991) ratio for T-Tauri stars falls right next to the MYSO line, so is not shown on the plot.

Most of the MYSOs fall very close to, or on the Te = 7500 K and Ne = 10 6 cm −3 line. However, for a minority of sources, the Br 10/Br γ ratio is much greater than that pre-  Carr (1990) (circles) and Ishii et al. (2001) (triangles). Only detections above the 3σ limit are shown. The solid lines represent the loci of L H 2 = 10 −4 L BOL , L H 2 = 10 −5 L BOL , and L H 2 = 10 −6 L BOL . In both plots, all the line luminosities have been corrected for extinction, and the RMS data have been corrected for the difference between measured and catalogue magnitudes. dicted by case-B recombination for the MYSO values of Te and Ne -closer to the Bary et al. (2008) T-Tauri line. This could imply that for these YSOs Br γ is optically thick and therefore that the recombination does not conform to case-B. This is in contrast to the optically thin H II regions in which recombination line ratios do follow the case-B values. Alternatively, the Te and Ne values for these stars could be closer to those found by Bary et al. (2008) for T-Tauri stars than the previously observed values for MYSOs. Very few of the objects have Br 10/Br γ ratios very close to the line for which both Br 10 and Br γ are assumed to be optically thick. This suggests that though Br γ may be optically thick for some sources, Br 10 is usually optically thin.


## Shock Emission: Molecular H2 and Forbidden [Fe II]

The detection rate of the molecular H2 2.1218 µm line is 56%, and 9% have additional molecular H2 lines. This is a higher detection rate than found by Ishii et al. (2001) for intermediate-mass YSOs (34%), and much higher than the rate found by Carr (1990) for low-mass YSOs (25%). Ishii et al. (2001) interpret the presence of strong H2 emission as emission produced by the shock where an outflow impacts the surrounding circumstellar material, indicating that at least 56% of the YSOs in our sample have a strong outflow. There may be more YSOs with outflows in our sample, with either not enough circumstellar material to form a shock, or aligned at such an angle that we cannot see the light from the shock. The left panel of Figure 10 shows H2 luminosity against bolometric luminosity. The equation of the regression line is
LH 2 = 10 −4.0 × (LBOL) 0.73(7)
The Kendall's τ value (see Table 2) shows that there is a correlation between the H2 luminosity and the bolometric luminosity of the star. The right panel of Figure 10 compares detections in the RMS sources with those of Carr (1990) and Ishii et al. (2001). The solid lines represent the loci of LH 2 = 10 −4 LBOL, LH 2 = 10 −5 LBOL, and LH 2 = 10 −6 LBOL. The Carr (1990) and Ishii et al. (2001) sources all have 10 −6 LBOL < LH 2 < 10 −4 LBOL, as do most of the RMS sources. This implies a common production mechanism for H2 for low-mass and high-mass YSOs, as with Br γ, adding further evidence to the idea that high-mass YSOs are very similar to low-mass YSOs.

[Fe II] 1.64402 µm emission is also shock excited (Lumsden et al. 1994;Porter et al. 1998). As described in Section 6.1, its close proximity to Br 12 makes analysis of this line difficult. 20 objects (i.e. 11%) were found to have [Fe II] emission without the rest of the Br series. An estimated 46 further objects (i.e. 25%) have [Fe II] blended with Br 12. This figure is probably an upper limit, since the assumption that H I emission in YSOs conform to case-B of Baker & Menzel (1938) is probably not valid for all YSOs (see Section 6.3 and Figure 9).


## Accretion Discs: CO Bandhead and Fluorescent Fe II Emission

The production of CO bandhead emission requires high densities and temperatures which can only be found in a circumstellar disc ( 2004; Davies et al. 2010;Wheelwright et al. 2010). Fluorescent Fe II 1.6878 µm emission in the MYSOs probably also originates in discs: it is known to originate in a disc in both AGN (e.g. Baldwin et al. 2004) and classical Be stars (e.g. Zorec et al. 2007), and has previously been observed in high-mass YSOs by Porter et al. (1998) and Lumsden et al. (2012), and in low-mass YSOs (though less frequently) by Hamann & Persson (1992). The CO bandhead was seen in 17% of the YSO spectra. This detection rate is lower than both the Carr (1989) rate for low-mass YSOs (20%) and the Ishii et al. (2001) rate for intermediate-mass YSOs (22%). Fe II emission was seen in 26% of our sources with visible H-band, usually in those objects with strong H-band H I emission. 7 objects were not visible at this wavelength, and more were very noisy so this detection rate should be considered as a lower limit. There is seldom overlap between the two lines -only 6 YSOs have both fluorescent Fe II and CO bandhead emission. In total, 76 RMS objects (i.e. 39%) have evidence of a circumstellar disc.

Connelley & Greene (2010) note in their paper on lowmass Class I YSOs that all objects with CO bandhead emission also show Br γ emission. This trend is seen, though not as strongly, in the high-mass RMS YSOs: 75% of all YSOs have Br γ emission, and 85% of YSOs with CO bandhead emission have Br γ. This is a higher Br γ detection rate for YSOs with CO bandhead. However, 5 out of 36 (i.e. 14%) RMS objects with CO bandhead emission do not also have Br γ emission.

The left panel of Figure 11 shows CO 2-0 bandhead luminosity against bolometric luminosity. The lines represent the ATS regressions. Due to the number of censored data points (i.e. limits), a least-squares fit was not appropriate; the least-squares method either ignores the censored points or considers them with equal weight to the uncensored points, either of which gives a bias to the results of a fit. This is why regression was performed using the Akritas-Thiel-Sen (ATS) non-parametric algorithm rather than the usual least-squares method, and correlation tests were performed using the Kendall's τ method (Akritas, Murphy, & LaValley 1995). These methods take into account the effect of censored data points on the correlation and regression, without giving them equal weight to the detections. For data with few censored points, the ATS line is comparable with the least squares method, so can handle a wide variety of data sets. For consistency and to allow like-for-like comparison with the other lines, the ATS method was used for all regressions and correlation tests.

Initially, the fit and correlation tests were performed on all the data. The results show that there is no overall correlation between CO bandhead luminosity and bolometric luminosity (see Table 2). However, when non-detections are excluded, a correlation between the CO bandhead and bolometric luminosity is found. This difference is reflected in the regression lines: The equation for all the data including non-detections is
LCO = 10 −5.1 × (LBOL) 0.58(8)
The equation for detections only is
LCO = 10 −4.1 × (LBOL) 0.83(9)
The non-detections 'push' the line down to well below where  it would be if only detections were taken into account. This demonstrates the effect that censored data points have on a large sample, and shows that it is important to include the censored points in the analysis when trying to understand the overall trends in the data-set. This regression method was employed for all the data for consistency, even when the censored points have only a minimal effect on the results (e.g. Br γ emission).

For the CO bandhead emission, the reason for this difference may be that the ability to detect CO bandhead is unreliable. In some objects the broad CO bandhead emission may simply be obscured by the spectral noise, or it may be swamped in a steeply rising continuum caused by excess dust emission. This effect probably predominates for the sources with the higher limits in Figure 11. It is known that CO bandhead emission is variable in some MYSOs (e.g. Biscaya et al. 1997;Clarke et al. 2006). If this is true for other MYSOs in our sample, we may not have observed the object when CO bandhead emission is present. There may be an inclination effect, though we have no way of testing this suggestion at this low resolution. Alternatively, some objects may be genuinely CO weak, particularly those objects with very low limits in Figure 11. This may indicate the lack of a disk with suitable neutral material for these objects, suggestive of very low accretion rates.

The right panel of Figure 11 compares detections in the RMS sources with those of Carr (1989) and Ishii et al. (2001). The solid lines represent the loci of LCO = 10 −3 LBOL, LCO = 10 −4 LBOL, and LCO = 10 −5 LBOL. Most sources from all 3 surveys have 10 −5 LBOL < LCO < 10 −3 LBOL. This shows that, once again, there is a trend through the low-, intermediate-and high-mass YSOs, implying a common mechanism throughout the mass range for sources in which CO is detected.

Fluorescent Fe II 1.6878 µm emission is also thought to originate in a disk (Baldwin et al. 2004;Zorec et al. 2007). Figure 12 shows fluorescent Fe II 1.6878 µm luminosity against bolometric luminosity. The lines represent the ATS regressions. Again, due to the large number of limits, two regressions were performed. No overall correlation was found, but there was a correlation between LFe II and LBOL when non-detections were excluded (see Table 2). As for CO bandhead, this difference is reflected in the regression lines: The equation for all the data including non-detections is
LFe II = 10 −4.2 × (LBOL) 0.54(10)
The equation for detections only is
LFe II = 10 −4.1 × (LBOL) 0.82(11)
Spectral noise may have an effect, and is probably the cause of the higher upper limits in Figure 12. However, we believe that the main effect differentiating between detections only and all data including non-detections is probably that there are genuine differences between sources. These differences will be discussed in more detail in a future paper.

6.6 He I

The He I 2.0587 µm line was seen in emission in 15% of YSOs. Due to the requirement of hard UV photons to ion-ize helium, it was naively expected that there should be a threshold luminosity of ∼ 10 4 L⊙ or more. This is not seen in the data; He I emission is seen across the whole luminosity range covered by the RMS data. This implies that either luminosity is not necessarily a good indicator of temperature for high mass YSOs, or temperature does not drive He I production. Collisionally excited He I emission is frequently seen in low-mass T-Tauri stars, originating in a stellar wind (Edwards et al. 2006;Edwards 2007Edwards , 2009). The He I emission in the RMS sources with luminosity L < 10 4 L⊙ is probably also collisionally excited, originating in a wind, rather than ionized as in H II regions. This may also be the emission mechanism for some (or all) of the stars with L > 10 4 L⊙. In addition, He I was seen in absorption in 5 spectra (e.g. G076.3829-00.6210 / S106IR, see Figure 3), or with a P-Cygni type profile in 15 spectra (see Table B3). Unfortunately, at this low resolution it was not possible to obtain expansion velocities for these lines. He I 2.0587 µm absorption has been studied in detail with high resolution spectroscopy for G076.3829-00.6210 by Drew et al. (1993). They concluded that to be seen in absorption, this line requires high kinetic temperatures (T 10 4 K) and electron densities (ne 10 8 cm −3 ) in order for the transition to be preferentially populated from below rather than above. This suggests that the He I absorption in G076.3829-00.6210 is produced in an outflow originating very close to the star. It is likely that He I absorption in other high-mass YSOs also originates in an outflow. Figure 13 shows He I 2.0587 µm luminosity against bolometric luminosity, for sources with He I in emission. He I absorption is not included in this plot. The lines represent the ATS regressions. Again, two regressions and correlation tests were performed, finding that a correlation between He I luminosity and bolometric luminosity is not an overall trend in the MYSO population, but does exist where He I is detected (see Table 2). The equation for all the data including non-detections is
LHe I = 10 −5.8 × (LBOL) 0.78(12)
The equation for detections only is
LHe I = 10 −4.5 × (LBOL) 0.92(13)
In this case, spectral noise is less likely to be a causal factor for the differences in the analysis; the spectrum at 2.0587 µm is not as noisy as at ∼ 2.3 µm or the H-band. It is possible that the low resolution of the spectra mean that selfabsorption could prevent us from detecting He I if the line is sufficiently narrow. At higher resolutions we may see He I in more objects when the profile could be resolved. However, it is more likely that the results of these correlation tests reflect real differences between the sources.


# CONCLUSIONS

Near-IR spectroscopic data were obtained for 247 objects selected from the RMS survey. The spectra were classified, finding 180 YSOs, 15 YSOs within H II regions, 26 H II regions, 7 evolved stars, 5 PPN, 4 PN, 5 M-type supergiants, and 5 evolved hot stars. Spectra were found to be a valuable confirmation of classification in addition to our imaging data in 45% of cases, and the only means of classifying the source in 5%. The properties of the YSOs are as follows:

• The YSOs have luminosities ranging from 52 L⊙ to 3.5 × 10 5 L⊙, and extinctions ranging from AV = 2.7 to AV = 114.

• Most YSOs were found to have emission lines, though not all had the same lines. The detection rates of Br γ, H2, CO bandhead, [Fe II] 1.64 µm, fluorescent Fe II 1.6878 µm, and He I 2.0587 µm were 75%, 56%, 17%, 11%, 26%, and 15% respectively. He I 2.0587 µm was seen in absorption in 5 spectra. Br γ and He I 2.0587 µm were seen with P-Cygni type profiles in 13 and 15 objects respectively, of which 8 objects had both lines with P-Cygni profiles. This indicates the presence of an outflowing wind.

• In total, 39% of the YSOs were found to have either fluorescent Fe II 1.6878 µm or CO bandhead emission (or both), both of which are evidence of a circumstellar disc. 56% had H2 emission, indicating the presence of an outflow.

• The Br γ, H2, and CO bandhead data were compared with low-mass YSOs from Carr (1989Carr ( , 1990) and intermediate-mass YSOs from Ishii et al. (2001). The Br γ detection rate was lower than that for the intermediate-mass YSOs, but comparable with the detection rate for low-mass YSOs. The H2 detection rate was higher than the detection rates for both the low-and intermediate-mass YSOs. Conversely, the CO bandhead detection rate was lower for the RMS YSOs than for both the low-and intermediate-mass YSOs. The differences in detection rates between the 3 data sets may be due to differences in obscuration and evolution. We will discuss these differences in more detail in Cooper et al. (in preparation).

• Strong correlations were found between LBrγ and LBOL and between LH 2 and LBOL.

• For CO bandhead, no overall correlation was found with LBOL. However, when non-detections were excluded, there was a correlation. This may be due to the difficulty in distinguishing broad emission lines from a steeply rising continuum, variability in the emission, or because some objects genuinely do not have CO bandhead emission (perhaps indicating an evolutionary sequence).

• The same effect was seen for both Fe II 1.6878 µm and He I 2.0587 µm emission: no overall correlation with LBOL was found but there were correlations found when only detections above 3σ were considered. For Fe II, spectral noise is likely to be an issue for some sources, but we believe the major contribution is that there are real differences between the sources. For He I, spectral noise is unlikely to be the issue: the continuum at around ∼ 2.06 µm is not as noisy as at ∼ 2.3 µm or in the H-band. However, self-absorption might cause the emission line not to be seen at this low resolution. Again, it may also be explained by genuine differences between the sources.

• The line luminosity data for Br γ, H2, and CO bandhead detections were compared with the low-mass YSOs from Carr (1989Carr ( , 1990) and intermediate-mass YSOs from Ishii et al. (2001). For all three lines, a trend was seen across the whole mass range, from luminosities spanning five orders of magnitude. This suggests that the production mechanism for each line is the same for low-, intermediate-, and highmass stars, i.e. high-mass YSOs appear to resemble scaledup versions of low-mass YSOs. This is consistent with cur-rent theories in which all stars form in a similar fashion, e.g. Krumholz et al. (2009).

Time), classification, distance, luminosity, and radio data. The PA was chosen individually for each object from any images that were available. For the earlier objects, these were 2MASS images, but for the later runs GLIMPSE images were used. The aim was to centre on the target object, but to align the slit to catch any extended emission, outflow, or other interesting nearby objects in the slit at the same time. Some objects were observed multiple times with different PAs to get spectra of all the interesting features in the region (see Section 2). The exposure times were chosen based on the magnitudes of the target object (shown in Table A2). The classification process is described in Section 4, and the distance, luminosity, and radio data were taken from other RMS publications, listed in Section 1. * The final spectrum of G025.6498+01.0491 is a composite of two spectra, taken on 20070626 Figure 1 for comparing measured magnitudes with catalogue magnitudes (see Section 3). '-' is shown when there are no catalogue magnitudes available at that wavelength. Where '-' is marked in the error field for the catalogue magnitudes, the magnitude shown is a lower limit (i.e. an upper limit on the flux for non-detections or confused fields). Note that this only happens for 2MASS PSC magnitudes; UKIDSS GPS have a different quality flagging system, as described on the WFCAM Science Archive website. The measured magnitudes were calculated from flux measurements in the spectra (see Section 3). '-' is marked in the upper error field of the H-Band measured magnitude to indicate where the H-Band flux is so low that the flux errorbar goes below zero, which makes the magnitude error incalculable. Several of the objects are invisible at H in the spectrum. In these cases, '-' is marked in the measured H-Band magnitude fields.  Table A3. A V and f obs /fcorr for all objects.

Detection frequency of spectral features in YSO spectra. All detections are at the 3σ level or better. The percentages are based on totals of 195 objects for the K-band, 188 for Br 10 and fluorescent Fe II, and 186 for the shorter wavelength H-band lines. This takes account of the fact that some of the objects were not detected for part or all of the H-band meaning determining the presence or absence of the lines in that region was impossible.5.0×10 -13

Figure 7. The H-band section of the spectrum of the YSO 
G019.8922+00.1023. This object has both the Brackett series 
and the [Fe II] 1.64402 µm line, as well as the fluorescent Fe II 
1.6878 µm line. Note that the Br 12 / [Fe II] line at ∼ 1.64 µm 
is much stronger than the other Brackett series lines.

## Table B1 .
B1YSO and YSO/HIIR emission line fluxes for Br γ, Br 10, Br 11, Br 12 / [Fe II] 1.64402 µm blend, H2 2.1218 µm, H2 2.2477 µm, fluorescent Fe II 1.6878 µm, and He I 2.0587 µm. Fluxes are in Wm −2 µm −1 , and a negative value indicates absorption. '-' is marked to indicate that a measurement was not possible due to a negative H-band flux (i.e. where the object was invisible at H). The presence or absence of the Pfund series is shown in the 'Pfund' column: 'P' for present, '-' for abscent.Name

Equivalent widths (inÅ) of CO 2-0 bandhead emission for the YSOs, with the mean continuum flux density (in Wm −2 µm −1 ) in the 2.2825 -2.2875 µm region just to the blue end of the bandhead. A positive EW indicates emission. The errors are quoted to 1σ; the limits are 3σ limits. The negative for G032.4727+00.2041 is used to indicate that while looking at the spectrum there appears to be absorption, but the detection is not above the 3σ threshold. All other limits are limits on emission. B2 Table, CO EW (Å) Cont. Flux Density Name CO EW (Å) Cont. Flux Density Name CO EW (Å)Table B2.
