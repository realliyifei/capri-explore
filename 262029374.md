Background and Aim: Esophageal squamous papilloma (ESP) is a benign growth in the esophagus with unknown malignant potential.The mechanism underlying ESP formation is unknown, but human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been proposed as a potential etiology.We sought to investigate the clinical characteristic of ESP in our population, review the current literature, and highlight the role of HPV.Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study conducted at two referral centers.We selected the ESP population by free-text search in the pathology department database and selected controls randomly from the general endoscopy population.Immunostains were used to evaluate ESP tissue for HPV.Results: Between January 2016 and December 2021, we identified 66 patients with ESP, with a prevalence of 0.72%.ESP patients were younger, with a median age of 52 years (P = 0.021), and more likely African American (34.4 vs 7.5%, P < 0.001) compared to controls.On endoscopy images, the growth was predominantly solitary (92.5%) in the middle of the esophagus (39.4%), with sizes ranging from 0.2 to 2.3 cm.A total of 62 patients had available tissue for HPV immune staining, and none tested positive for HPV.Eighteen patients had a follow-up endoscopy with an average of 504.5 days follow-up period.One patient developed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma during follow-up.Conclusions: We observed a higher prevalence of ESP compared to previous studies.The formation of ESP is multifactorial and partially explained by HPV infection in selected populations.The malignant potential of ESP is low but not negligible.MethodsThe present study is a retrospective case-control study of electronic medical records (EMRs) as well as human tissue sample staining and reviewing.The study was conducted at Medstar

## Introduction

Squamous cell papillomas (SCPs) are benign growths at various locations in the body.Structurally, papillomas would be either exophytic or endophytic lesions, with the epithelium surrounding a fibrovascular core on histology. 1Esophageal squamous papilloma (ESP) is a subtype of SCP seen in the esophagus.In comparison with other forms of SCP, ESP is an asymptomatic lesion diagnosed incidentally by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), where it appears as an exophytic growth with crossing surface vessels on narrow-band imaging. 2,3Its rarity can be partially due to its internal location and asymptomatic nature.

ESP was first described anatomically in 1927 4 and histologically in 1959. 5Since then, our knowledge of ESP has expanded from case reports and series.The proposed mechanisms for ESP formation include mechanical trauma, or chemical injury as in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is an alternative explanation, while other infections such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been cited.Lastly, ESP can be a part of a genetic disorder, as seen in Goltz-Gorlin syndrome and Cowden syndrome. 1,6SP is commonly approached as a benign lesion and treated with complete resection.The long-term prognosis and outcomes for recurrence and potential malignancy of ESP are lacking in order to develop optimal management of ESP.The aim of our study is to identify the clinical risk factors of ESP in comparison with a control population and examine the role of HPV in ESP formation.

DC.The Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at Georgetown University and MedStar Health reviewed and approved the study.

The ESP population was extracted from the pathology department database through a free-text search of pathology reports.We included patients from January 2016 to December 2021.Patients were included in the study if they had a previous pathological diagnosis of ESP after EGD with available tissue samples.Patients were excluded from the study if younger than 18 years of age or if endoscopic information was not available.

The control population was selected randomly from the pool of patients who underwent EGD using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes during the same time period as the cases.Controls were included in the study if EGD data were available and excluded if they were younger than 18 years of age.Controls were matched to the cases using propensity matching based on the site where EGD was performed, the year of EGD, and the setting as inpatient or ambulatory.We matched ESP to control with a 1:5 ratio.

EMRs of both cases and controls were reviewed systematically.We gathered the patient's demographics, medical comorbidities, pre-endoscopic symptom profile, and medication use.We reviewed EGD report regarding ESP location, size, morphological description, and recurrence on subsequent EGDs.Pathology reports were reviewed by the investigator, and, independently, the tissue samples were evaluated by a pathologist to confirm the diagnosis.

To investigate ESP tissue samples for HPV virus involvement, 3-μm-thick sections from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue blocks were obtained.The samples were stained with HE and HPV stain (clone K1H8; ready-to-use, Dako, CA, USA), which has been validated to detect HPV 6, 11, 16, 18,  31, 33, 42, 51, 52, 56, and 58, based on the manufacturer's specification.Staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with adequate positive controls.HE and immunostains were reviewed by a single pathologist.

For data analysis, the D'Agostino-Pearson test was used to test normality.Categorical variables were presented as the frequency with percentages (%), and associations were examined using the Fisher exact test.On the other hand, for non-normal continuous variables, we used the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and presented the data with the median and interquartile range (IQR).Analysis was done with R software, and significance was set at a P-value of <0.05.


## Results

Population summary.During the study period from January 2016 to December 2021, 9406 patients underwent EGDs and 68 patients had ESP, corresponding to a prevalence of 0.7% of EGD cases.We excluded two ESP patients: one younger than 18 years of age, and the other missing a detailed EGD report.The control group was randomly selected from those patients who had an EGD taken during the study period with a ratio of five controls per case, and thus a total of 340 control patients were selected.Among the selected control group patients, 333 were included for further analysis after excluding 7 due to the unavailability of a detailed EGD report.Of the total study population, 92.5% had their EGD done in an outpatient setting, 58.2% in MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, and 41.8% in MedStar Washington Hospital Center.

The ESP population was younger, with a median age of 52 years (P = 0.021) compared to 59 in the control population.Females represented 57.6% of the ESP study group, and a similar proportion was observed in the non-ESP control patients (P = 1).In the ESP group, there were 31 Caucasians (48.4%) and 22 African Americans (34.4%), in comparison to 296 (88.9%) and 25 (7.5%), respectively, in the control group (P < 0.001).None of the patients in the ESP cohort was Hispanic, while the control group had 12 Hispanic patients (3.6%) (Table 1).

Clinical characteristics.Upon reviewing the clinical characteristics, patients with papilloma infection had similar rates of active smoking (40.9 vs 42.0%, P = 0.892), heavy alcohol consumption (46.2 vs 45.2%, P = 1), diabetes (16.7 vs 22.2%, P = 0.41), hypertension (40.9 vs 51.7%, P = 0.138), hyperlipidemia (27.3 vs 31.5%,P = 0.56), and GERD (31.8 vs 43.5%, P = 0.1) when compared with controls.On the other hand, the rate of cirrhosis (6.1 vs 19.2%, P = 0.007) and use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs; 33.3 vs 47.7%, P = 0.042) were higher in the control population.ESP patients showed a similar basic laboratory profile as that in controls (Table 2).The median hemoglobin concentration, platelets count, white cells count, glomerular filtration rate, and electrolyte level were comparable between the study groups.On the other hand, aspartate transaminase (P = 0.002), alanine transaminase (P = 0.012) were higher and albumin (P = 0.021) concentrations were lower in controls.

Patients' presentation.The indication for endoscopic evaluation in ESP patients fell under three categories: presenting some gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (34 patients), surveillance of known gastrointestinal illness (28 patients), and abnormal imaging findings on radiography (4 patients).The most frequent symptoms before endoscopy in ESP patients were epigastric pain in 24 patients (36.4%), followed by dysphagia in 12 (18.2%).In contrast, heartburn and epigastric pain were the most frequent symptoms in the controls, with 85 patients (25.5%) in each category.The symptom profile is shown in Figure 1.There was no statistical difference in symptoms between ESP patients and controls, except for heartburn, which was significantly more common in controls (P = 0.021).

ESP on endoscopy.ESP was found at various locations, with various numbers and size ranges in different patients.ESP was located in the upper esophagus in 20 patients (30.3%), in the middle esophagus in 26 patients (39.4%), in the lower esophagus in 14 patients (21.2%), and near or at the Z-line in 4 patients (6.1%).Only two patients (3.0%) had ESP in more than one location.Regarding the number of lesions, 61 patients (92.4%) had a solitary ESP, 5 patients (7.5%) had multiple ESPs but less than five lesions, and none had more than five lesions.Lastly, the size of ESP ranged from 0.2 to 2.3 cm at the largest diameter.All ESP patients underwent complete resection of the lesions.

Biopsy and tissue findings.For further histopathological examination, we identified 62 ESP patients (93.9%) with available tissue blocks for HPV immune staining.Our investigation results were negative for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 42, 51, 52, 56, and 58 in all ESP patients.We had gastric biopsy results for 27 ESP patients (40.9%).Of those, 4 (6%) had Helicobacter pylori, and 1 (1.5%) had a benign gastric ulcer.In contrast, 201 patients in the control group had gastric biopsy, 6 (1.8%) had H. pylori (P = 0.06), and 21 (6.3%) had a gastric ulcer (P = 0.14).

Cancer and recurrence.All the lesions of ESP patients were completely removed, and 18 patients underwent subsequent EGDs for various indications after ESP diagnosis, with an average follow-up duration of 504.5 days.Of those, 17 showed no signs of recurrence, while one patient developed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).In our ESP group, two patients were identified with having ESCC.One patient had simultaneous ESP and ESCC diagnosis, while the other had in situ ESCC originating from ESP tissue, which progressed to ESCC at an adjacent site during follow-up.Neither patient showed dysphagia, and both had nonspecific symptoms such as epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and heartburn.Neither patient reported a history of smoking, GERD, or a family history of ESCC, but one had a history of alcohol abuse.During EGD, both patients had papillomas larger than 1 cm and nodular esophageal mucosa with ulceration.Additionally, one ESP patient was coincidentally diagnosed with gastric carcinoid.


## Discussion

Demographics and prevalence.ESP is a relatively rare finding in endoscopy.The reported prevalence of ESP found on endoscopy in the literature has ranged from 0.01 to 0.45% [7][8][9][10] as seen in Table 3. Pediatric population has a prevalence comparable to adults at 0.08%. 2 Our findings suggested a prevalence rate of 0.7% in our study population during our 6-year study period.The high prevalence can be explained by the significantly uptrending ESP incidence rate from 0.13 to 0.57% between 2000 and 2013 in the United States. 21The observed increase in ESP can be related to increasing EGD availability, recent improvements in ESP detection with new high-definition endoscopes, and the awareness of gastroenterologists of the condition.An old autopsy-based study found a prevalence of 0.04% in 7549 autopsies. 22he typical demographics of ESP patients are not clearly known because of the rarity of the disease.Studies have shown a median age between 49 and 50 years. 9,10,18Recent studies have shown a higher proportion of female ESP patients, 10,18 although old literature shows male predominance. 13,23Few studies have reported the race of ESP patients, but predominantly more White patients had ESP. 23In our study, we found that ESP patients are younger, are more African Americans, and have the same maleto-female ratio, compared to the control group.These findings are similar to those of a study on the Italian population, which showed that the ESP population is younger compared to the general endoscopy population with similar male-to-female ratio.Symptoms, laboratory results, and endoscopic features.The pre-endoscopic symptomatology profiles for the ESP patients and control patients are shown in Figure 1.Epigastric pain was the most common symptom and was seen in more than one-third of the ESP patients, but it is unclear whether ESP is a contributor to the reported pain.Previous studies have shown higher rates of epigastric pain than our population, ranging from 47.6 to 62.5%. 15,18As for dysphagia, the ESP and control groups had similar rates: 18.2 versus 14.4%, which are significantly higher than those from earlier studies that showed 0-4.3% 15,18 of ESP patients had dysphagia.The low rate of dysphagia in other studies is likely due to the small size of ESP on endoscopy.Heartburn, a surrogate for GERD, was seen only in 12.1% of ESP patients, compared to 25.5% in the control population, thus suggesting that GERD may not be a major pathogenic mechanism for ESP formation.

The control population in the study showed a 19.2% liver cirrhosis rate.The observed high rate of cirrhosis is related to the nature of the study hospital, which is a referral center for liver transplants.In light of that, controls showed higher liver enzyme levels and lower albumin levels.The previous investigation of ESP patients did not include laboratory evaluation for comparison.Our study did not show any difference between the general endoscopy population and ESP patients except for the liver profile.

On endoscopy, ESP is usually seen as a single exophytic lesion less than 5 mm on the largest diameter. 8,15,18,24Multiple lesions and larger diameters are reported, as seen in our study, in a small number of cases but are not typical. 9,18,25ESP can be seen in any part of the esophagus.Earlier studies have shown lower esophageal ESP as predominant, while our study and many recent studies show that ESP is predominantly found in the middle esophagus (Table 3).

Etiology and pathogenesis mechanisms.The mechanism for ESP formation is an active field of investigation.HPV infections have been proposed as a possible etiology or a contributor since HPV has been observed in the papillomas in other parts of the body, such as oral and nasopharyngeal papillomas. 1 HPV is a DNA virus and a member of the Papillomaviridae family. 26There are more than 100 types of HPV, which are divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their oncological potential. 26As shown in Table 3, the rate of HPV detection in ESP varies drastically between different studies, ranging from 0 to 87.5%.The geographical region where the study was conducted cannot explain this difference in HPV detection.Our results showed no HPV detection on immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the ESP pathology specimens from ESP patients, in contrast to the study done in the United States in 1994, which showed a rate of  Significance was set at a P-value of <0.05.BUN, blood urea nitrogen; IQR, interquartile range.

4.7% using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 14A similar finding was seen in Italy, with contradicting results from the same regions. 7,15The results also did not show any consistent trend over time, and HPV was detected at various rates in earlier and recent studies (Table 3).Thus, these findings indicate that HPV detection rates in ESP are not related to recent HPV vaccination or changes in the HPV prevalence over time.Moreover, different HPV testing modalities cannot explain this wide variation.Although different HPV detecting methods have different sensitivities, 27,28 a similar detection rate was seen in studies comparing and using multiple HPV detection modalities. 17,29This is consistent with the conclusion of a meta-analysis conducted in 2012. 30ow-risk HPV 6 and 11 are the most commonly seen variants in ESP-HPV-positive patients, which is consistent with the observed pattern in the upper aerodigestive track. 1 High-risk HPV 16 was observed in some ESP patients too. 13Transmission of HPV to esophageal mucosa is not clearly understood.Vertical transmission is a potential method that requires further  investigation.The pediatric ESP rate is similar to that in adults, and most of the pediatric cases were HPV-negative, reducing the likelihood of vertical transmission being the primary method. 2irect transition from the oral mucosa is less plausible, as HPVpositive ESP was seen all over the esophagus and commonly in distal esophagus (Table 3).HPV transmission through blood might explain the observed findings. 31s HPV does not explain most of the observed ESP, alternative mechanisms have been suggested.The proposed pathogenesis of ESP includes chronic irritation, inflammation, and regeneration. 14,23Several factors, such as GERD, direct trauma, smoking, and alcohol intake, have been investigated as possible causes.GERD was hypothesized in earlier studies because ESP patients had high rates of reflux esophagitis, and ESP was located predominantly in the lower esophagus in those studies 13,23 (Table 3).A study in Japan suggested that HPV-negative ESP has a higher rate of neutrophil infiltrate, with increased neutrophils toward the lower esophagus. 10This finding suggests that inflammation plays an integral role in HPV-negative ESP and that reflux esophagitis might be a driving factor for lower esophagus ESP.Our population was HPV-negative, with a comparable but slightly lower rate of GERD and lower heartburns in ESP cases compared to controls.Furthermore, ESP in our study was predominantly located in the middle esophagus.Our findings are consistent with most recent literature, which show a low rate of reflux esophagitis and predominant location of ESP as the middle esophagus 10,15,19,20 (Table 3).The increasing use of PPIs in recent times might explain some of this shift, although our result shows higher rates of PPI use in controls.

Alcohol and smoking are well-known irritants to the esophagus, and both have been associated with ESCC. 32,33Their role in ESP is suggested but not supported by evidence.The rate of smoking and alcohol use was similar in our study between ESP cases and controls.In an Italian study comparing the rate of smoking and alcohol consumption between patients with ESP or ESCC with the general endoscopy population, ESP patients had a similar rate of alcohol consumption as the general endoscopy population. 15ESP patients had a higher rate of smoking compared to the general population in the Italian study, but it did not reach statistical significance. 15Lastly, minor esophageal trauma has been reported to precede ESP formation, as noted in an esophageal cancer case symptomatically managed with a stent, which then became complicated by dysphagia due to ESP. 34 A theory combining all the previously mentioned factors may explain some ESP lesions, but many patients do not have any of the suggested mechanisms or risk factors.Future studies are needed to investigate alternative etiologies.

Recurrence, cancer risk, and follow-up.9]16 In most studies, there was no recurrence after the removal of benign, non-dysplastic ESP.A French study showed a recurrence rate of 3.4% after the first ESP removal and 0% after the second one. 9In the study, they did not remove many ESPs on the first EGD, and records were used to judge which ESPs reoccurred and which were not removed in the first place. 9The follow-up rate varies, but none of the studies reported a follow-up rate higher than 50%.The low follow-up rate, as well as low recurrence rate of ESP, limits the efforts to understand ESP recurrence, but based on our findings and current evidence, the recurrence rate ranged from zero to very low.

6][37] Although the majority of the studies did not show malignant transformation during the follow-up period, our study and a few others showed a malignant transformation during the follow-up period.Moreover, squamous cell papilloma in other regions of the body, under special circumstances, can have malignant potential. 1The characteristics of the ESP that showed malignant transformation are large, multiple, circumferential, and confluent. 9,25,35,37On biopsy, they observed dysplastic changes and atypia. 9,25,35,37HPV testing from most patients was negative, 25,35,36 and most of the patients had a presentation of dysphagia. 9,25,35,36he high rate of smoking and drinking in patients with malignant transformation is a major confounding factor in concluding the malignant potential of ESP.Field carcinogenesis theory can be applied to this condition, especially with observed synchronous malignancy cases 9,16 with high concurrent Barrett's and reflux esophagitis in some studies. 13While HPV is common and implicated in poor outcomes in ESCC 29,38 and malignant transformation of papillomas in other parts of the body, 1 ESP cases with malignant transformations were negative for HPV.

Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer death and tends to affect males more than females. 39On the other hand, ESP affects both genders, with slight female predominance in the newer studies as ours. 10,18A study comparing ESP and ESCC population found that ESP patients are younger by more than 10 years on average and have no dysphagia on presentation, which is present in 82% of ESCC patients. 15These vast differences in population demographics decrease the possibility that ESP is a direct precursor of ESCC, but it can act as an indirect precursor with selective progression into ESCC in some populations.

Considering the relatively low rates of recurrence and malignant transformation in patients with ESP, it is necessary to establish criteria to determine which patients require close monitoring and the appropriate intervals.Our recommendation is to closely monitor patients with multiple confluent ESPs, those larger than 0.5 cm, and those with atypia or dysplasia detected through histological analysis.Special consideration should be given to patients with other risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use.Additionally, dysphagia in a patient with ESP should be viewed as a warning sign.However, owing to the scarcity of data and limited evidence to support a specific follow-up interval, the decision on the duration of monitoring of ESP should be made jointly by the patient and physician.

Our study is the largest clinical study on ESP in the US population, with matched controls representing the general endoscopy population.However, the relatively small number of ESP cases due to its rarity has limited detailed subgroup analyses.In addition, our results were subject to limitations of the retrospective observational study design and referral bias due to being done in tertiary medical centers.

In conclusion, ESP is a rare esophageal lesion diagnosed on EGD with a nonspecific symptom profile.The pathogenesis of ESP is not well known but likely multifactorial.HPV and GERD may explain the subgroup of ESP formation, but other unknown etiologies and pathogenic mechanisms will need further investigations in the future.The malignant potential of ESP is very low, but large or multiple ESPs with dysplasia on histology carries a definitely high malignancy potential and therefore should be resected.The role of longer term follow-up of patients with small, low-risk ESP is unclear, but closer follow-up of those with large or high-risk ESP is prudent.However, an appropriate follow-up interval for those ESP patients is uncertain because of the limited data on longer term follow-up of ESP patients.
