Potassium is one of the essential nutrients required by plant for multiple purposes like growth of root and stem, activation of enzymes, opening and closing of stomata, triggers osmoregulatory process etc. It is abundant in soil but most of the time unavailable to the plants because of its availability in bound or adsorbed forms. Many strains of microbes present in soil act on insoluble form of potassium to solubilize or mobilize this form to available form known as potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB). The soil which is deficient or excess in potassium, the application of such strains of microbes enhanced the availability of potassium to the plant. Use of such microbes is found very effective in maintaining the availability of potassium nutrient to the crop while decreases the dependency on inorganic fertilizers for compensating the demand of plants. Nowadays, the role of KSB is widely accepted hence it can help to maintain the availability of potassium as well as enhance the production of crop.

## Introduction

Potassium is the third most important plant nutrient after nitrogen and phosphorus. It has a wide range of function in plant life in which some of the valuable functions are develop tolerance capacity by triggering osmoregulatory process, activate enzymes related to energy metabolism, photosynthesis and starch synthesis. Out of all the amount of potassium present in the earth crust, only 1-2% is available to the plant while rest amount of potassium is present in the bounded form. It presents in four most popular forms in soil i.e. mineral, nonexchangeable, and exchangeable and solution in which 90-98% is in mineral form which is unavailable to plants (Etesami et al., 2017 andSparks andHuang, 1985) [5] . The nonexchangeable form varies between 1-10% which present between the layers of clay (Etesami et al., 2017;Sparks, 1987 andSparks andHuang, 1985) [5] . Various kinds of microorganisms survive in rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric zone of soil while the plant is getting affected by rhizospheric microbes where they are able to influence soil fertility by influencing the processes like nutrient release, decomposition, mineralization, immobilization (Zahra et al., 1984 andParmar andSindhu, 2013). There are some most prominent mechanism (acidolysis, polysaccharides, complexolysis, chelation) by which the beneficial soil microbes like saprophytic bacteria, fungal strains and actinomycetes solubilize insoluble forms of K in to soluble forms (Vandevivere et al.,1994;Barker et al., 1998). Therefore, the application of such microorganisms as KSM/KSB (K solubilizing microorganism/bacteria) is a favourable approach for enhancing the availability of K in soil.


## Potential of KSB/KSM for the yield betterment

Enough evidence is available to show the betterment of production from seed germination to yield of crops by the use of potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB) and potassium solubilizing microorganism (KSM). It is also reported that by the use of B. mucilaginosus strain RCBC13, the improvement is not only observe in nutrient uptake but also observe in biomass production, shoot and root growth in different crops like tomato, cotton, rape and wheat (Sheng  [14,1,9,11,17,18] . For the better establishment of seedling, flowering fruiting and yield, a strong association among the microbes and plant roots are compulsory while each and every plant need a special strain of microbial culture.

However, the selection of suitable strain by plant roots decided by the release of exudate or signal from the plant roots. KSB is also popularly known as plant growth promoting bacteria hence it provide support to the plant in two different ways either direct way or through plant growth hormone ( 


## Role of KSB in Stress Condition

Biotic and abiotic stress is the major constraint for the crop production in agriculture around the world. It includes wide range of stress in which environmental stresses cause very drastic situation like extreme heat and cold, flood and drought, salinity and heavy metals stress etc. potassium is third most important macro element needed by plant that affect physiological and biochemical process in favour of plants (Kandpal et al., 2018) [7] . The value of potassium fertilizer is well known for the boost up the crop production because a positive relationship between potassium fertilizer and grain yield is already reported by various scientists hence the consumption of potassium fertilizer increased rapidly (Wang et al., 2013) [17] . A very high concentration of potassium as an ion already reported in plant cell that make plant healthy not only in normal conditions of environment but also play a vital role under stress condition. It helps to activate various enzymes responsible for the smooth conductance of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, minerals and water uptake and its translocation (Wang et al., 2013;Etesami et al., 2017) [17,5] . Nowadays, the use of fertilizers including potassium increased rapidly but due to the use of heavy dose of fertilizer, its bad effect is also reflecting side by side on soil health and fertility level. With the view of above requirement and its bad effect on soil, the use of potassium solubilizing microorganism (KSB) or potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB) is the one of the best and cheap option to compensate the requirement of potassium to the plant (Zafarul-Hye, et al., 2020, and Raghavendra et al., 2020 [16,12] .


## Methods of KSB Application

The bio-fertilizer or potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB) may work efficiently in the soil when it is available in optimum dose along with better strain of culture and mode of application. There are many methods already in practice like soil application, seed treatment, along with drip irrigation. Three L of KSB along with potent organic base carrier is optimum when applied in soil while 10 ml Kg-1 seed along with suitable sticker as a seed treatment and 3 L KSB liquid culture in 500 L water ha-1 is optimum dose to achieve better result from the cultivated land (Shanware et al., 2014 andRaghavendra et al., 2020) [13,12] .


## Conclusion

Nowadays the popularity of potassium solubilizers are increasing because of many reasons like it is cheapest, environmental-friendly and good source of natural K. Hence it increases the K availability and K use efficiency thereby not only the pressure of synthetic fertilizer is reducing but production is also improves.
